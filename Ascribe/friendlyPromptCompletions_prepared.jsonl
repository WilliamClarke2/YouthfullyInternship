This report is the result of input from nearly 1,000 young people from all walks of life across Canada. It celebrates the valuable contributions of young people and recognizes their potential to shape a brighter future for everyone. \n\nThe youth in Canada are actively involved, resourceful, and resilient. They are not just the leaders of tomorrow, but also the leaders of today. They understand the key challenges our country faces and have innovative ideas and solutions to address them. \n\nThe report focuses on their top priorities, which include truth and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, environmental and climate action, health and wellness, leadership and impact, employment, as well as innovation, skills, and learning. It outlines their perspectives on these issues and presents their vision for a better Canada that benefits all.\n\nThe past year has been tough for everyone due to the global pandemic, and young people in Canada have been particularly affected. They have made significant sacrifices to protect their loved ones. As we rebuild and recover from this crisis, it is crucial that we prioritize the needs of our youth. That's why the Canadian government has invested in supporting vulnerable youth, including those facing employment barriers. We are also making it easier for young people to pursue education, reduce student debt, and find training and work opportunities.\n\nThe future of Canada lies in the hands of our youth. When we invest in them, we are investing in the success and long-term prosperity of our country. I want to express my gratitude to the hundreds of young people who contributed to this report, as well as everyone involved in its creation. As the former Minister of Youth, I am committed to advancing this important work through my youth council and the continued implementation of Canada's first-ever youth policy.\n\nThe government will continue to listen to the voices of young people, work alongside them, and take action to empower them to drive change in their communities and achieve their dreams. This State of Youth Report is unique in many ways and serves as a reminder that young people throughout the country are brimming with fresh and innovative ideas to tackle even the most complex issues in our country.\n\nThe recommendations in this report were shaped through engagement sessions with around 1,000 young people, including those from First Nations, Métis, Inuit, Black, racialized, and LGBTQ2 communities. Many of these young people face barriers to meaningful participation in society. In my role as the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, I have had the privilege of meeting many of these inspiring youth and witnessing their dedication to building a better Canada. Just like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I believe in the power of youth, which is why it was so important to create this report \"for youth, with youth, and by youth.\"\n\nWhile this may be the first report of its kind, it is part of our government's ongoing commitment to creating a brighter future for young people in Canada. It is essential to remember that youth in Canada come from diverse backgrounds and face unique circumstances based on where they live, their life stage, and their background. These intersectional identities contribute to the rich diversity of our country but can sometimes hinder young people from reaching their full potential.\n\nWith this important context in mind, I invite you to read this report, reflect on the recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the lives of young people in our country, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. I truly believe that by listening to and hearing from our young leaders, we can build a better future for all Canadians. END"}

However, an exciting opportunity at an aerospace company and landing a job as a shuttle flight controller at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in 2008 changed his path and led him to the aerospace industry. Reid is now the founder and CEO of Mission Control, a space exploration and robotics company based in Ottawa that was established in 2015. From its humble beginnings to producing software that will be used on the moon, the company has achieved great success and will reach a significant milestone next year.\n\nMission Control has partnered with the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to assist a small rover in navigating the moon's terrain. The company's cutting-edge artificial intelligence software operates robots remotely through the internet. On Earth, the software will send real-time data to scientists at four Canadian universities who will collaborate with the Dubai Space Centre team to determine the rover's path. This partnership with the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre gives Mission Control the opportunity to demonstrate their technology in space for the first time.\n\n\"I'm really proud of our team and honored to represent Canada on the Emirates' lunar mission,\" said Reid. \"This is the first Canadian software, the first Canadian computer, and the first Canadian artificial intelligence to go to the moon.\"\n\nMission Control is fully prepared for their first venture into space, which could open up numerous opportunities for the company. They have been practicing using their software with a small \"space\" setup in their office—an impressive 4,000-square-foot room designed to resemble the moon's surface—where they drive rovers. Dubbed the \"Moonyard\" by the company, this testing facility is equipped with sand, rocks, craters, black walls, and simulated sunlight, allowing Mission Control and its partners to practice before embarking on real moon explorations.\n\nIn 2021, Mission Control proudly shared their world-class facility and software in Dubai. Reid and several colleagues attended Expo 2020 Dubai and the International Astronautical Congress to showcase their work to a global audience.\n\n\"It's crucial in the space industry to collaborate with international space organizations. Almost no space missions can be accomplished by a single country,\" explained Reid. \"Participating in events like Expo is essential for us to establish relationships, partnerships, and successfully execute exciting and important space missions.\"\n\nMission Control has received support from Canada's Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) to explore markets in Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates. During a trade mission to the United Arab Emirates in 2019, Reid met with officials from the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre for the first time. Additionally, the TCS introduced Reid to iSpace, a lunar exploration company in Japan that plays a crucial role in the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre mission.

Pearson Building. This building holds great significance as a symbol of Canada's involvement on the international stage. Located at 125 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, it serves as the headquarters of Global Affairs Canada and is home to approximately 3,300 employees. \n\nLet us take a moment to celebrate the rich history and enduring legacy of this remarkable building! The Lester B. Pearson Building is situated on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg people. It holds a prominent position on Sussex Drive, which is part of the ceremonial route from Parliament Hill to Rideau Hall, the Governor General's residence. \n\nWith its four office towers, this building has become an integral part of Canada's architectural and governmental heritage. Designed by the firm Webb Zerafa Menkès Housden and constructed between 1970 and 1973, it was named in honor of Lester B. Pearson, an esteemed Prime Minister, diplomat, and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Pearson's visionary leadership played a crucial role in historic contributions to peacekeeping, including the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force. \n\n\"It is fitting that Canada's first physical representation of its relations with the world be named after Mr. Pearson,\" stated a government spokesman to the New York Times in 1973. The architectural brilliance of the building showcases the late modern movement and incorporates elements of brutalism. The design aimed to evoke a sense of tranquility, dignity, precision, and restraint. This vision is reflected in the strong horizontal lines, organic form, and use of dark materials. \n\nThe Lester B. Pearson Building stands as a landmark and leaves a lasting impression on all who visit the bustling neighborhood. Over the past five decades, it has served as the epicenter of the department now known as Global Affairs Canada. Its halls have witnessed historic events, state visits, and significant diplomatic engagements. The building was officially opened on August 1, 1973, by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, who expressed her joy at the ceremony taking place on the eve of her first Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. This timing underscored the significance of the moment for the Commonwealth nations. \n\nThe dedicated foreign service officers and diplomatic leaders who work within the building have played a pivotal role in promoting and safeguarding Canada's interests on the global stage. Throughout the past 50 years, the Lester B. Pearson Building has housed public servants who have championed causes such as human rights, gender equality, and peacekeeping worldwide. The department has advanced Canada's foreign policy objectives, showcased the nation's values, and provided a strong voice in international forums. \n\nAs the world evolves, so does this esteemed federal heritage building. In 2017, a large-scale rehabilitation project was announced to enhance its environmental performance. Upgrades to plumbing and electrical systems are being made, with a goal of achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certification. Furthermore, the interior spaces are being transformed to align with the new government of Canada standard for offices, which emphasizes collaboration and flexibility and was announced in 2022. \n\nAs we celebrate the Lester B. Pearson Building's 50th anniversary, let us pay tribute to its remarkable heritage. This iconic structure remains a steadfast embodiment of Canada's commitment to diplomacy, collaboration, and global engagement. Let us draw inspiration from the values and principles it represents as we move forward, working to foster peace, prosperity, and cooperation on the world stage. END"}
{"prompt":"canada was one of the first countries in the world to put in place a feminist international assistance policy in 2017 . but what does having a feminist approach to international assistance mean ? are we leaving men and boys behind to prioritize women ? absolutely not . the feminist international assistance policy ( fiap ) is feminist because it addresses the root causes of poverty through an intersectional , human rights-based and feminist lens , meaning it considers multiple and overlapping forms of discrimination . this enablesus to identify the groups and individuals in situations of extreme poverty , vulnerability and marginalization . the fiap looks to level the playing field by addressing key barriers to equality . this is important because we cannot eliminate poverty without considering the needs of different groups of people . an estimated 55% of the global population faces instability and poverty . entrenched gender inequalities affect women and girls more than men and boys , and in different ways . this is true both in canada and around the world , particularly for women and groups pushed to the peripheries of society . to create a more peaceful and prosperous world for everyone , we need to tackle inequalities so that people — no matter their gender identity or expression , sex characteristics or other identity factors — can fully enjoy their human rights . the feminist policy’s goal is to reduce poverty around the world interventions that advance gender equality are proven to make the most significant progress toward this goal . a united nations study found that closing the gender gap on farms and in agrifood systems would increase global gross domestic product by nearly a trillion us dollars . this would reduce the number of food-insecure people by 45 million . that’s 1 of many statistics that illustrate current inequality . if half of small-scale producers benefited from development interventions that focused on empowering women , it would significantly raise the incomes of an additional 58 million people and increase the resilience of an additional 235 million people . this is why canada funds projects like seedchange , which ensured women made up 50% of the leadership positions in collective enterprises like farming co-ops and increased participation in traditionally male-dominated areas . seedchange targeted the central american dry corridor , burkina faso , mali and ethiopia , where it helped increase seed , food and economic security for 26 , 046 small-scale farm households . as a result of the project , households grew more fruits and vegetables , along with more diverse crops , making more food available to families living in poverty . the data collected over five years proved the project led tohealthier diets , better livelihoods , improved climate resilience , and greater autonomy in every community . more than 100 women’s groups and almost 40 youth-run co-ops broke down the barriers they faced to entering the marketplace . in gaza , female-headed households are far more likely to live in poverty and experience pronounced inequality in a society where traditional gender roles dominate . through the canada-funded salalem leadership institute , sarah , a single parent of 2 , joined an 8-week entrepreneurship training program and received support for her agricultural startup . “i was born and raised as a farmer , ” says sarah . “since i was young , i have grown and tended to the plants . with the help of my mother and brothers , i succeeded to start my dream business that will provide my children a secured future . ” sarah received mentorship support through salalem to improve fer farming practices and expand her business . sarah has so far harvested crops for at least 6 consecutive farming seasons . after one year of successfully running her business she was able to rent a bigger piece of land to diversify and increase her farming productions . she also bought goats , which helped her to start up an animal breeding and productions line . ->","completion":" Canada was at the forefront when it implemented its feminist international assistance policy in 2017. But what does it mean to have a feminist approach to international assistance? It certainly doesn't mean leaving men and boys behind to prioritize women. In fact, the feminist international assistance policy (FIAP) addresses the root causes of poverty through an intersectional, human rights-based, and feminist lens. This means that it recognizes and takes into account the various and overlapping forms of discrimination that different groups and individuals face when in extreme poverty, vulnerability, and marginalization.\n\nThe FIAP aims to level the playing field by tackling the barriers that hinder equality. This is crucial because we cannot eradicate poverty without considering the needs of all people. Approximately 55% of the global population faces poverty and instability. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by entrenched gender inequalities, both in Canada and around the world. This disparity is particularly evident for women and marginalized groups pushed to the outskirts of society. To create a more peaceful and prosperous world for everyone, it is essential to address these inequalities so that individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, sex characteristics, or other identity factors, can fully enjoy their human rights.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the feminist policy is to reduce poverty worldwide. Interventions that promote gender equality have been proven to make significant progress toward this goal. A United Nations study found that closing the gender gap in farming and agrifood systems would boost global gross domestic product by almost a trillion US dollars and reduce the number of food-insecure people by 45 million. This is just one statistic that highlights the current inequality.\n\nTo support this cause, Canada funds projects like SeedChange. Through SeedChange, women comprise 50% of leadership positions in collective enterprises such as farming co-ops, and participation in traditionally male-dominated areas is increased. SeedChange focuses on regions such as the Central American Dry Corridor, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Ethiopia, where it has helped enhance seed, food, and economic security for 26,046 small-scale farm households. As a result of the project, these households have been able to grow more fruits, vegetables, and diverse crops, providing more food for families living in poverty. Data collected over five years has shown that the project has led to healthier diets, improved livelihoods, enhanced climate resilience, and greater autonomy within the communities. More than 100 women's groups and nearly 40 youth-run co-ops have shattered barriers to enter the marketplace.\n\nIn Gaza, where traditional gender roles dominate and female-headed households are more likely to live in poverty and face inequality, the Canada-funded Salalem Leadership Institute has made a difference. Sarah, a single parent of two, joined an 8-week entrepreneurship training program and received support for her agricultural startup through this program. Sarah's passion for farming was nurtured from a young age, and with the help of her mother and brothers, she successfully started her dream business, providing a secure future for her children. Salalem provided mentorship support to Sarah, enabling her to improve her farming practices and expand her business. Sarah has now harvested crops for six consecutive farming seasons and, after a year of successful business operations, she was able to rent a larger piece of land to diversify and increase her farming production. She also ventured into animal breeding and production, purchasing goats to establish this new line of business.\n\nThrough initiatives like SeedChange and the Salalem Leadership Institute, Canada is actively working towards reducing poverty and empowering individuals, regardless of their gender, to achieve their dreams and build a better future.

Ideally, it should enhance your operations in terms of size, layout, location, and appearance, while still adhering to zoning and environmental regulations. Commercial buildings come in various shapes, locations, and prices, so it's important to understand your needs and budget. If you've already worked on a business plan, you probably have an idea of the amount you can allocate for rent, mortgage, utilities, and taxes. Conducting a cash-flow analysis will help determine if purchasing a commercial property is feasible or if renting is a more viable option. Renting may allow you to retain more working capital for your business operations. However, it's important to consider potential rent increases. On the other hand, owning your property provides stability with fixed monthly mortgage payments and the advantage of building equity. When deciding to buy or lease your commercial space, make sure to carefully evaluate your options. In the meantime, here are five tips to guide your search for the right location for your business:\n\n1. Tailor your selection to your business needs: For retailers, factors such as ample parking, pedestrian traffic, and attractive decor are important. Being situated near popular stores can attract walk-by customers. If you sell high-end clothing, it's best to avoid discount malls and opt for a location near other high-end retailers like shoe stores or jewelers. While location and decor may be less critical for small wholesale or manufacturing operations, it's essential to comply with zoning regulations. Additionally, consider the availability of qualified employees within a half-hour commute of your potential location.\n\n2. Assess modification requirements: If you find a suitable building in a good location, consider what modifications may be necessary to make it ideal. The question then arises of who will bear the cost. If you're renting a space that requires modifications, negotiate with the owner and ensure a clear contract is in place, specifying the work, deadlines, and penalties for delayed completion. If you decide to purchase, hire an accredited inspection company to identify any defects or environmental contamination on the property. Defects can be points of negotiation, while some changes may require approval from local boards or authorities.\n\n3. Take into account local taxes and infrastructure: Municipalities have varying tax rates, with some offering preferential rates to attract businesses. Your commercial real estate agent should be able to provide information on taxes, as well as the availability of infrastructure and utilities such as internet access, garbage pickup, roads, electricity, and natural gas at the potential locations you are considering.

They protect the habitats, wildlife, and ecosystem diversity that define these natural regions. Stretching across the coasts, interior mountains, plains, and great lakes, these parks come in various sizes, from the small Georgian Bay Islands National Park of Canada spanning 14 km² to the vast Wood Buffalo National Park of Canada, encompassing almost 45,000 km². Well-known names like Banff and Jasper coexist with more recently established parks such as Ivvavik and Vuntut.\n\nParks Canada is dedicated to both preserving the ecosystems within these magnificent areas and managing them to ensure visitors can appreciate and enjoy them without compromising their integrity. By immersing ourselves in the awe-inspiring scenery and natural surroundings of national parks, we can better connect with nature, develop a deep respect for it, and commit to its protection. Each national park serves as a sanctuary for the human spirit, telling the stories of how these lands came to be, with mountains rising, lakes forming, rivers flowing, forests growing, glaciers shifting, and grasslands evolving. They also offer glimpses of ongoing natural processes, from floods and fires to the migration of species. Through national parks, we have the opportunity to connect with nature, connect with people, and understand the events that have shaped the people of this land.\n\nVisitors can embark on incredible experiences, such as paddling along rivers flowing through canyons carved over thousands of years, observing birds as they rest during their migratory journeys, and walking through vibrant forests rejuvenated by fire. These moments are truly unforgettable, and Parks Canada provides rich experiences to enhance them. Our priority is to protect the ecological integrity of our national parks by maintaining or restoring the health and balance of their ecosystems. We aim for a state where biodiversity, structures, and functions remain unimpaired and sustainable.\n\nThe national parks of Canada are a source of great pride for Canadians and an integral part of our identity. They celebrate the extraordinary beauty and boundless variety of our land. The national parks system plan serves as a guide for the protection of each unique natural region in Canada. It has shaped the expansion of our parks' system for many years. If you would like a PDF copy of the national park system plan (1997), please contact us at information@pc.gc.ca. END"}

It may seem impossible for us, but somehow these tiny creatures manage to do it. Not only do they travel across the Great Lakes, but they migrate across entire countries. However, this amazing journey is becoming increasingly difficult for them each year.\n\nIn the fall, monarch butterflies escape the cold by migrating from southern Canada all the way down to Mexico, where they spend the winter. Then, in the spring, a new generation of butterflies travels thousands of kilometers back from Mexico, crossing the United States, fields, mountains, and even the Great Lakes to return to Canada and start the cycle again.\n\nNow, imagine if these butterflies arrived in Canada only to find asphalt and mowed grass everywhere. They would have no food and nowhere to rest and recover. That's why Parks Canada is working hard to ensure this doesn't happen, and they need your help!\n\nThankfully, when many monarchs cross Lake Erie from the United States, they are met by Point Pelee National Park. This park, located at the southernmost point of mainland Canada, is the most ecologically diverse national park in the country. Here, the butterflies can find an abundance of food and shelter to rest after their long journey.\n\nSome butterflies will then continue north and east throughout Ontario, finding summer homes in other Parks Canada administered places like Bruce Peninsula National Park, Rouge National Urban Park, and Georgian Bay Islands National Park. However, these are just stops along their migration. As they move beyond national parks, they face a fragmented landscape, with habitat lost and broken up by urban development, roads, and industrial agriculture.\n\nTo support these at-risk species, Parks Canada is restoring ecosystems to provide stepping stones of habitat. These stops help birds and butterflies move more freely and easily in their natural environment. By planting native trees, grasses, and wildflowers in protected areas, Parks Canada is creating food and habitat for migrating species to rest and refuel before continuing their journey.\n\nIn the last five years, Parks Canada, along with indigenous communities, partners, and volunteers, has restored over 40 hectares (98.8 acres) of meadow, coastal sand dune, and savannah habitat in Ontario's national parks. These habitats are crucial for pollinators. Together, we have also planted over 145,000 native shrubs and trees, as well as almost 18,000 native grasses and wildflowers.\n\nParks Canada's work to conserve and restore healthy ecosystems that provide important habitat is just one piece of a larger puzzle. You can be part of the solution to habitat loss by providing your own habitat \"stepping stones\" too! Just imagine if, after leaving a national park, a monarch butterfly found your yard, garden box, or balcony filled with native plants. There, it could stop, rest, and refuel before continuing its journey to another protected area.\n\nYou don't need a big yard to make a difference. Even planting a small garden or a few native plants on your balcony is important, especially in urban areas. If you don't have space at home, you can join a community garden in your neighborhood. To help pollinators, we recommend planting a variety of native plants and wildflowers. Milkweed is especially beneficial for monarchs, as it is the only plant their caterpillars eat.\n\nYou can find ecoregional planting guides and a native plant finder tool on Pollinator Partnership Canada's website. Additionally, the Canadian Wildlife Federation's Canadian Native Plant Suppliers list can help you find local businesses to purchase your plants and seeds. Together, we can make the journey easier for these beautiful butterflies and other pollinators by creating habitats that support them. END"}

Unfortunately, they are often overlooked and underappreciated. This is partly because they don't fit neatly into the category of either land or water. Dr. Chantal Vis, an expert in aquatic ecosystems, explains that studying wetlands is challenging because you can only do so much research from the safety of solid ground or a boat.\n\nAnother reason wetlands are underloved is that many people consider them to be wasted land. Throughout history, wetlands have been drained to make room for agriculture and development. Sadly, this trend continues today. In fact, Southern Ontario has lost up to 68 percent of its wetlands, while urban areas in the prairies have lost up to 96 percent.\n\nPopular culture often portrays wetlands as dark and mysterious places, associated with snakes and monsters. However, this is far from the truth. Wetlands actually provide numerous benefits to both the environment and humans. They are like nature's kidneys, filtering out pollutants and purifying water. Wetland vegetation, such as cattails and bulrushes, can even remove toxic substances like heavy metals and fertilizers.\n\nAdditionally, wetlands play a crucial role in flood and erosion control. They absorb and slow down excess water, preventing flooding in nearby areas. During dry periods, they release the stored water to replenish the surroundings. Wetlands also have a significant impact on our global climate. They absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Bogs, in particular, contain peat, which further enhances their ability to store carbon.\n\nFurthermore, wetlands are incredibly biodiverse and provide habitats for a third of all North American species at risk. They are like ecological supermarkets, supporting a wide range of plants and animals. In many parts of the world, wetlands also serve as a vital source of fuel and building materials.\n\nRecognizing the importance of wetlands, organizations like the Rouge National Urban Park in Ontario are working diligently to restore and recreate these valuable habitats. By partnering with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, schools, community groups, and indigenous communities, they have successfully restored over 60 hectares of wetland, stream, and riverbank habitats since 2015. Their restoration efforts involve careful planning and mimicking the natural processes that would have existed in the past. By thinking like beavers, they create wetlands that can effectively filter agricultural runoff and reduce flooding on farmers' fields.\n\nThe work at the Rouge National Urban Park and other national parks highlights the vital role of wetlands as natural engineering systems that support the health of our living world. Dr. Chantal Vis emphasizes that wetlands deserve more recognition and appreciation for the crucial services they provide. Perhaps someone should write a song to spread the word about the importance of wetlands. END"}

However, this despised crustacean may hold the key to solving the global issue of plastic pollution. Parks Canada has joined forces with Dr. Audrey Moores, a chemistry professor at McGill University, to explore a method of creating biodegradable plastic from the shells of these crabs. It's a perfect collaboration that brings together a common enemy, the green crab, with the cause of \"green chemistry.\" The journey began when Dr. Moores published a paper on using the material from insect and crustacean shells, called chitin, to produce biodegradable plastic. This caught the attention of Gabrielle Beaulieu, the coastal restoration project manager at Kejimkujik National Park and Historic Site in Nova Scotia. They approached Dr. Moores with the idea of turning their green crab problem into a solution. Dr. Moores was immediately intrigued and saw the potential. The partnership has already achieved success with a crowdfunding campaign through the Fathom Fund, a project of the Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network (MEOPAR). Parks Canada has pledged $20,000 to the project, which will be used to hire a full-time researcher near Kejimkujik. Kejimkujik National Park has been combating the green crab invasion since 2007 when they noticed the disappearance of eelgrass, which serves as a vital habitat for marine life. The loss of eelgrass had a ripple effect, impacting not only the marine species but also the birds that rely on them for food. The green crabs were responsible for ripping out the eelgrass to access their food sources. Kejimkujik implemented a trapping and removal program, including a citizen science initiative called \"Gone Crabbin',\" which allows park visitors to contribute to the control program. So far, they have successfully removed 2 million green crabs from the park's estuary locations. As a result, almost 40% of the original eelgrass beds have returned, and overall biodiversity has improved. Kejimkujik had already found success in creating a demand for the green crab as lobster bait and as an edible product. This new partnership will create a year-round demand for the crustacean, benefiting both coastal communities and ecosystems, and potentially improving the health of the ocean. Traditional plastic is a major problem for the world's oceans as it doesn't break down and can harm marine life. Approximately one-third of the world's plastic ends up in the ocean. Biodegradable plastic is already being made from chitin, but on a small scale and with potentially harmful methods. Dr. Moores' approach, using green chemistry, aims to produce the plastic cleanly and on a larger scale. Therefore, the despised european green crab may actually contribute to the health of our oceans. It's always satisfying to see a villain become a hero, or at least provide ingredients for the heroes' work. END"}

Recently, the two leaders successfully concluded their second annual dialogue, where they discussed a wide range of important issues and strengthened the relationship between their countries. Both sides have agreed to continue exploring the possibility of a comprehensive trade agreement, which will create more opportunities for people in both Canada and China.\n\nOne important aspect of this agreement is the resolution of agrifood market access. Canada and China are committed to fully implementing the 2016 agreement, which will expand market access for Canadian frozen bone-in beef and Chinese filled grain products. Additionally, they have agreed to launch a pilot project for the export of Canadian chilled beef and pork. This partnership on natural resources and energy is also crucial. Canada and China are working together to reduce emissions, promote clean energy solutions, and support economic growth while protecting the environment. They also plan to establish new eco-districts and tall wood structures using Canadian wood products and energy-efficient technologies.\n\nLaw enforcement cooperation is essential in combating the illicit manufacture and trafficking of drugs, especially fentanyl and other opioids. The leaders have directed their officials to redouble their efforts in addressing this issue. Canada appreciates China's efforts in disrupting the illicit trafficking of fentanyl and welcomes their classification of controlled substances under Chinese law and investigation of leads provided by foreign law enforcement.\n\nBoth Canada and China believe in the importance of youth engagement and education. They support further opportunities for youth exchanges and international education. A memorandum of understanding has been signed to facilitate China's ongoing funding of scholarships for Canadian post-secondary students. Canada will also provide financial support to increase opportunities for Canadian youth to study in China and for youth internships at Canadian missions in China.\n\nCooperation on defence and security is another area of focus. Canada and China will continue to strengthen military-to-military interactions and plan for a royal Canadian navy port visit to China in 2018. They will also enhance exchanges and cooperation in UN peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response, with a specific emphasis on the women, peace, and security agenda.\n\nAs tourism between the two countries is expected to grow, efforts will be made to ensure proportional growth in air transport services. This will help facilitate travel and strengthen the relationship further. Canada and China have also agreed to engage and collaborate on pressing regional and global challenges, and they have exchanged views on issues concerning North Korea and Myanmar.\n\nCultural exchanges are an important aspect of the relationship between Canada and China.

However, it is important to acknowledge that the federal government is right to pursue these individuals. They took advantage of a hastily implemented system with few safeguards and exploited the generosity of Canadians. The design of the program inadvertently incentivized people to stop working, and even when their employers wanted them to return, they chose to keep the money they knowingly received while ineligible.\n\nIt is crucial to understand the context in which pandemic programs like CERB were launched. The government actively encouraged people to apply for these benefits as a means to support themselves and stay safe during the uncertain times brought about by the pandemic. In the early stages, the rules surrounding these programs constantly changed, leading to confusion. This confusion was amplified by contradictory information available online, with legacy rules still accessible and conflicting with the updated guidelines.\n\nAdditionally, social assistance recipients, who constitute approximately 5% of Canada's population (or 1 in 20 people), were legally obligated to apply for CERB and faced penalties if they failed to do so. The benefits received from these pandemic programs were largely deducted from other benefits they were entitled to. As a result of the aftermath, the rules pertaining to pandemic benefits were significantly tightened.\n\nFirst, the $5,000 income threshold was restricted only to the incomes specified in the legislation, which was more restrictive than what was conveyed on websites. For example, honorariums were initially mentioned as qualifying income online but were not covered in the CERB legislation. \n\nSecond, the requirement for the $5,000 income was not just earning it but actually receiving it. Many individuals worked during the pandemic but experienced delays or failures in receiving their pay due to business distress. However, these individuals are retroactively deemed ineligible for CERB. This rule seems unfair, as the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) often refuses to accept explanations for difficulties in obtaining documentation of earnings unless it is brought to tax court.\n\nThird, CERB claimants were retrospectively expected to provide detailed bookkeeping to prove their eligibility, almost to the level of forensic accounting. If individuals were unable to provide such accounts, they were often disqualified.\n\nFourth, there were no exceptions or room for judges to determine eligibility for claimants who narrowly missed meeting the requirements. Most programs have some form of exceptionality, but it is entirely absent when it comes to pandemic benefits.\n\nFifth, the hardship rules that would typically apply to extend payment terms are being significantly restricted.\n\nLastly, over $50 million in new funds were allocated in the federal budget to investigate low-income individuals who were found ineligible for benefits, despite the discrepancies in communication and administration. \n\nUnfortunately, all of these factors combined are causing significant harm and overshadowing the fact that Canada achieved its poverty reduction goals nine years ahead of schedule. Instead of celebrating this remarkable achievement, some perceive it as a failed experiment in protecting our most vulnerable residents, which is far from the truth. END"}
{"prompt":"working in open government means learning how to listen to citizens and stakeholders . when it comes to how the government of canada approaches citizen engagement , over and over again we have heard a recurring theme it must be authentic and meaningful . to help us achieve this goal , we’ve developed a set of principles and guidelines with the goal of ensuring that the government of canada engagement on policy issues is 1 . transparent 2 . relevant 3 . inclusive 4 . accountable 5 . adaptable this post answers how we got to those principles , and what’s behind them . our first really large engagement process was conducted in 2013 to support the development of canada’s second action plan on open government . talking to canadians , we heard concerns about meaningful engagement and turned that advice into a commitment to “develop a set of principles and standards for public consultations in discussion with citizens and civil society . ” to meet this commitment , we started with an environmental scan to see what others around the world were doing . after reviewing existing practices , we took our show on the road . we conducted workshops with the federal government’s regulatory community , our resident experts who are required by law to consult when revisions or changes are being proposed . we also raised the problem for discussion with the academic community at the congress of humanities and social sciences in june 2015 . the next step was the canadian open dialogue forum where we helped co-create a set of principles with more than 200 participants from civil society , government , academia and business during a two-day conference in march 2016 . before , during and after the event , participants debated and pulled together ideas and reactions , which resulted in a draft list of 16 principles . we kept on consulting , refining and editing to ensure that both the government and our community was satisfied with a document that reflected openness . along the way , we got some things wrong and needed to alter course , even after a lot of discussion . for example , at govmaker in 2016 we proposed the principle that “participants should know what’s on and off the table” to maximize relevance . the counter-argument – with which the room agreed - was that if the process is truly “open” then nothing should be entirely off the table . we also heard that the principles were written as though the government of canada would decide the issues , decide the approach , and take responsibility . instead , we heard calls for co-creation of engagement processes and shared accountability , which are now reflected . the result of this effort was a set of principles for engagement between government and citizens . we are now experimenting with applying the principles to public consultations , and are working to develop more detailed guidance about applying these principles in action . we are also working on using the principles as a basis for measuring the effectiveness of different types of public engagement activities being run by the government of canada . one of the most crucial needs is to keep working on effective relationships and engagement with indigenous peoples and nations . watch this spot for a future blog post on measuring the effectiveness of the principles and exploring the relationship between engagement and trust in government . thank you , and we look forward to learning with you . thom kearney and for the open government team ->","completion":" Working in open government means understanding the importance of listening to citizens and stakeholders. When it comes to citizen engagement in Canada, we have consistently heard that it must be genuine and valuable. To help us achieve this goal, we have created a set of principles and guidelines to ensure that our engagement on policy issues is transparent, relevant, inclusive, accountable, and adaptable.\n\nOur journey towards these principles began in 2013 when we conducted a large engagement process to support the development of Canada's second action plan on open government. Through conversations with Canadians, we learned about their concerns regarding meaningful engagement, and we turned that feedback into a commitment to develop principles and standards for public consultations, in collaboration with citizens and civil society.\n\nTo fulfill this commitment, we researched practices from across the globe and engaged with various communities. We held workshops with the federal government's regulatory community, who are required to consult on proposed revisions or changes. We also discussed the issue with the academic community at the congress of humanities and social sciences in June 2015.\n\nThe next step was the Canadian Open Dialogue Forum, where we collaborated with over 200 participants from civil society, government, academia, and business during a two-day conference in March 2016. Through extensive discussions and idea-sharing, we developed a draft list of 16 principles. We continued to consult, refine, and edit the principles to ensure that both the government and our community were satisfied with a document that truly embraced openness.\n\nThroughout this process, we made some mistakes and needed to make adjustments, even after thorough discussions. For instance, at GovMaker in 2016, we suggested that \"participants should know what's on and off the table\" to enhance relevance. However, the room agreed that if the process is genuinely \"open,\" nothing should be entirely off-limits. We also received feedback that the principles seemed to place decision-making solely in the hands of the government of Canada, rather than promoting co-creation and shared accountability. We have since incorporated these suggestions into the principles.\n\nThe outcome of our efforts is a set of principles for engagement between the government and citizens. We are currently experimenting with applying these principles to public consultations and working on providing more detailed guidance on their implementation. Additionally, we are exploring how to measure the effectiveness of different types of public engagement activities conducted by the government of Canada.\n\nOne area of great importance is our ongoing work towards building effective relationships and engagement with Indigenous peoples and nations. Stay tuned for a future blog post on measuring the effectiveness of the principles and examining the relationship between engagement and trust in government.\n\nThank you for your support, and we are excited to continue learning and growing together.\n\nThom Kearney and the Open Government Team END"}

{"prompt":"in my first blog post , i’d like to share my broader reflections on the core work of the rdu and describe our role , goals and day-to-day work , beyond our more visible work tracking progress on mandate letter commitments and reporting on outcomes ( more on those in my next post ) . first , we work to prepare materials for the prime minister and the cabinet committee on agenda , results and communications . these materials – usually in the form of dashboards , heat maps and short progress reports -- outline progress on key priorities and discuss where attention might be needed . for example , our reports highlighted progress on gender-based budgeting and analysis across the system , as well as improved recruitment of under-represented groups in canada’s uniformed and security agencies , but also identified where more progress was needed . having a short stock take meeting with the prime minister and key leaders , supported by data , was a very helpful way to accelerate progress . as a result , there is now greater clarity across the public service that the prime minister expects targets to be met and rigorous gender-based analysis and budgeting on all new proposals . in practice , this means that analyses of proposals will more thoroughly assess the differential impact on different groups , like women or racialized communities . we will be finalizing shortly our approach to publicly sharing these reports on results we do for the prime minister . second , we help departments as they prepare new policy and program submissions . our focus is on three simple questions what are you really hoping to achieve ? how will you achieve it ? how will you evaluate whether you’re achieving it and adjust if things aren’t going well ? this usually means offering advice to departments on their submissions to cabinet , but could also involve looking in more detail at their programs . recently , we’ve worked with departments as they clarified their policy goals and their evaluation strategies on many issues , including reducing homelessness , increasing broadband coverage in remote and rural communities , targeting the opioid crisis , improving outcomes for job training programs and reducing the carbon footprint of the federal government . third , we work closely with departments day-to-day to help ministers overcome obstacles to successful delivery of their initiatives within the system . that means that rather than letting problems fester , we surface problems , direct them to the right decision-making forum , and try to accelerate progress . in some cases , we undertake deeper dives on high priority issues that are not progressing as quickly as anticipated . this involves examining the overall delivery chain and all of the various partners and policies that may help or hinder successful delivery , which could include the federal government’s own rules on procurement and contracting , slow decision-making or capacity on the ground with partners . one such recent example is long-term boil water advisories on reserve . this has been a complicated issue that has been difficult to resolve . so , a joint team , composed of representatives from the departments , from pco and from communities has been mapping out the delivery chain and identifying challenges . these three functions were not previously performed in a systematic way across the federal government . of course , each in their own way was sometimes undertaken in response to particular situations , but not systematically in an on-going way . all of them are designed to support a larger objective shift the culture of the federal government to one more preoccupied with implementation issues and focused on outcomes . this means more investment in people who can deliver programs and projects , and more investment in data and evaluation to determine what results are being achieved . so “results & delivery” isn’t just the name of the unit – they are our mission every day . i guess we’re an autonym . this blog will be a place where i describe what we’re doing and discuss the challenges the public service confronts as we move towards a more outcomes-focused organization . in my next post i will discuss our approach to public reporting and what comes next . ->","completion":" In my first blog post, I want to share my thoughts on the important work of our organization and explain our role, goals, and day-to-day tasks. Our work goes beyond tracking commitments and reporting outcomes, although I will go into more detail about that in my next post.\n\nFirstly, we focus on preparing materials for the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Committee on Agenda, Results, and Communications. These materials, like dashboards, heat maps, and progress reports, highlight progress on key priorities and identify areas that may require attention. For example, our reports have shown progress in gender-based budgeting and analysis, as well as improving the recruitment of underrepresented groups in Canada's uniformed and security agencies. We also identify areas where more progress is needed. Having meetings with the Prime Minister and key leaders with data has been a valuable way to accelerate progress. As a result, there is now greater clarity that the Prime Minister expects targets to be met and rigorous gender-based analysis and budgeting on all new proposals. This means that proposals will be thoroughly assessed for their impact on different groups, such as women or racialized communities. We will soon be sharing these reports publicly to showcase the results we achieve for the Prime Minister.\n\nSecondly, we assist departments in preparing new policy and program submissions by asking three simple questions: What are you hoping to achieve? How will you achieve it? How will you evaluate and adjust if needed? We offer advice on their submissions to the Cabinet and sometimes delve deeper into their programs. Recently, we have worked with departments on various issues, including reducing homelessness, expanding broadband coverage, addressing the opioid crisis, improving job training programs, and reducing the carbon footprint of the federal government.\n\nThirdly, we collaborate closely with departments on a day-to-day basis to help ministers overcome obstacles and ensure successful delivery of their initiatives within the system. Instead of allowing problems to persist, we address them promptly, guide them to the appropriate decision-making forums, and strive to expedite progress. In some cases, we conduct thorough investigations into high-priority issues that are not progressing as expected. This involves examining the entire delivery chain, including partners and policies, such as procurement and contracting rules, as well as identifying any barriers to success. An example of this is the long-standing boil water advisories on reserves. To resolve this complex issue, a joint team consisting of representatives from departments, the Prime Minister's Office, and communities is mapping out the delivery chain and identifying challenges.\n\nThese three functions were not previously performed systematically across the federal government. Although they were addressed in specific situations, they were not consistently practiced. All of our efforts are aimed at shifting the culture of the federal government towards a greater focus on implementation and outcomes. This means investing more in people who can successfully deliver programs and projects, as well as investing in data and evaluation to determine the results being achieved. So, \"Results & Delivery\" is not just the name of our unit - it represents our mission every day. I like to think of us as an autonym. In this blog, I will share our activities and discuss the challenges the public service faces as we work towards becoming a more outcomes-focused organization. In my next post, I will delve into our approach to public reporting and what lies ahead. END"}

With advancements in technology and rising public expectations, being transparent is not just something we can do, but something we should do. Open government leads to more efficient, accountable, and responsive governance that meets the needs of citizens. Open data plays a crucial role in this, and governments have a unique opportunity to meet the demand for this valuable resource in the 21st century. Over the next decade, data will revolutionize the way we live, work, and think. We already see the impact of data in real-time transportation apps and access to information about schools and doctors, which empower citizens in their choices. Last week, Minister Francis Maude announced the extension of the family and friends test, allowing people to provide feedback on their experiences with public services. The possibilities for data utilization are endless. For example, by using freely available map data, a team at the Ordnance Survey created a map of Great Britain for the Minecraft computer game, demonstrating the educational potential of this data. The UK government aspires to be the most transparent in the world, and we are proud to be leaders in open data with over 10,000 datasets available at data.gov.uk. However, it's not enough to simply release data; it must also be accessible, user-friendly, and shareable. The vast amount of data we hold means we must prioritize what will bring the greatest value. That is why we have been consulting with citizens, businesses, and civil society to identify the core data for our national information infrastructure and ensure its availability to developers and entrepreneurs to foster economic growth. We are part of a global movement with international partners, including Canada, that supports the transformative impact of transparency and open government. This was highlighted at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, where all member states signed an open data charter committing to making their data widely accessible and published openly by default. The UK and Canada are also participants in the Open Government Partnership, a worldwide initiative involving 60 countries, aimed at promoting transparency, empowering citizens, fighting corruption, and utilizing new technologies. The recent joint UK-Canada Google Hangout on open data demonstrates our commitment to transparency and accountability in our own governments. We will be publishing national action plans in support of the open data charter and working together to extend the use of open data, including encouraging more countries to adopt the G8 charter and promoting public sector engagement to foster innovation and growth. The theme of open data will be a central focus of the OGP annual summit, which the UK will host in a few weeks. This event will bring together world leaders and civil society representatives to share success stories, ensure transparency promises are being upheld, and set ambitious new commitments on openness. The collaboration, sharing of best practices, and open scrutiny enabled by the OGP are essential to making transparency a credible force for change. Events like the Google Hangout with Minister Clement provide valuable opportunities to promote transparency and open data and gather insight and ideas from a wide range of sources. We hope this is just the beginning of many more such events. END"}

This question is not only important to my work, but also to the daily lives of every Canadian citizen. In the article \"The Government of Canada's Information Technology Strategic Plan,\" published in the August 2017 edition of the Public Sector Digest, I aim to address this question.\n\nMy main message is simple: in this digital and interconnected era, we need to completely rethink how our government operates. Instead of viewing public services as solely provided by public servants, we should see our government as an exponential platform where third parties can use available information to deliver services to citizens on behalf of the government. Unfortunately, until now, the Government of Canada has operated in an environment where information is not readily shared, partnerships are hard to cultivate, and linear approaches to engagement hinder our ability to serve citizens effectively.\n\nTo address these challenges, we released our Information Technology Strategic Plan for 2016-2020, marking a fundamental change in our approach to digital transformation. This plan aims to leverage technology's impact on our federal ecosystem by focusing on how we manage our technological assets, develop our people, and govern our enterprise. Essentially, all levels of our government must adapt and respond more quickly to the rapidly changing society we live in.\n\nWhile we will continue to invest federal funding in areas like superclusters and artificial intelligence, we need to see faster returns on these investments. We must prioritize open government and service agendas, creating conditions for government to operate as a platform. In the article, I outlined some steps forward, including adopting modern engagement tools, establishing proper technology architecture that meets citizens' expectations, and taking innovative approaches to procurement while enhancing collaboration with partners.\n\nMost importantly, we need to place our people at the center of our efforts. We must cultivate a public service that is inclusive of new approaches and empower our employees to embrace digital thinking. This requires a fundamental change in our public service to keep pace with the new world we live in, adapting to meet both traditional needs and new realities. As the Government of Canada's CIO, I have eagerly accepted this challenge and am thrilled to work with my staff to modernize the public service technology landscape for the benefit of all Canadian citizens.

We are following through on that commitment. Canadians, as well as their elected representatives, have the right to know how public funds are being used. It is crucial for our representative democracy that we can easily track where money is going. That is why our government has recently made significant changes to enhance the transparency, clarity, and accountability of government spending.\n\nEvery year, the government presents its spending plans for the upcoming year in the main estimates in Parliament. However, in the past, new initiatives announced in the federal budget were often not included in the main estimates because the budget was presented after the estimates. This created confusion and left parliamentarians in the dark, a system that was rightfully criticized as being absurd.\n\nWe have effectively resolved this issue. We have changed the order so that the main estimates now come after the budget, and we have included a budget implementation vote in the main estimates. For the first time in recent history, the main estimates I presented on April 16th include 100% of the measures announced in this year's budget. Parliamentarians now have more accurate and detailed information, enabling them to hold the government accountable for how taxpayer dollars are spent. This is a significant step forward in government accountability.\n\nTo achieve this, we have added a new centrally managed budget implementation vote to the existing list of centrally managed votes in the main estimates. By law, the Treasury Board, the committee that manages fund allocation to departments, can only allocate these funds to specific new budget measures as outlined in the budget's funding list. Any other use of public money would be unauthorized.\n\nEconomists Scott Clark and Peter DeVries gave Budget 2018 high marks for fiscal credibility and transparency, stating that it provides more detailed financial analysis and information than any budget they can remember. Critics who felt that such information was lacking should take the time to read the annexes. Auditor General Michael Ferguson has also emphasized that funds must be allocated based on the budget's guidelines and not at someone's discretion. We are showing Parliament exactly where the funding for the new budget implementation vote comes from and how it will be used. Parliamentarians can now literally follow the money from this new central vote to a specific line in the budget and the main estimates. To further improve clarity, we will include the allocations from Annex 1 of the main estimates directly in the supply bill that will be voted on by Parliament this spring.\n\nThis increased transparency is made possible by the unprecedented level of detail provided in the budget regarding new spending measures by department. We will also show Parliament how funds are being allocated to departments for specific budget measures through monthly online reporting and in the supplementary estimates throughout the year.\n\nFor example, let's consider the new women entrepreneurship strategy aimed at supporting women entrepreneurs and job creation. Canadians can now track funds committed to this strategy on a monthly basis, broken down by federal agency, as we expand support for women in business.\n\nThrough previous committee appearances on estimates reform and ongoing engagement with my fellow parliamentarians, I am openly discussing and collaborating on this reform exercise. Thanks to these important changes, parliamentarians now have better oversight of government spending than ever before. I firmly believe that this will result in a better and more transparent government for all Canadians. END"}

In many of these settings, I have also taught about benefit design. To make it easier, I created a guide on understanding benefit design and the ten principles of good benefit design.\n\nNow, when it comes to the CERB and CRB programs, it's important to note that they do not adhere to four of these principles. However, I don't blame the designers for this. Designing such a large suite of programs without making mistakes and taking shortcuts is nearly impossible. That being said, Canada should still be commended for the magnitude, effective delivery, and speed at which the pandemic benefits were rolled out.\n\nWhen speed is a top priority, it's understandable that principles of effective benefit delivery may not be at the forefront of decision-making. But as I mentioned before, two wrongs don't make a right. Mistakes made in the initial design can be rectified through appeals, just as the government has done for students, the self-employed, and low-income seniors. This is the crux of my objections in this series.\n\nSo, let's examine the violations that occurred when the CERB and CRB were quickly implemented. The first principle is aligning program objectives with design. The main objective of pandemic benefits was to ensure people's safety and keep them indoors during the early stages of the pandemic. Another objective was to assist those who lost their jobs and couldn't return to work. However, the CERB and CRB used the $5,000 threshold of 2019 earnings as a proxy to determine eligibility for pandemic benefits. This means that individuals who earned less than $5,000 but still suffered job loss were left out. Additionally, many had to continue working during the most dangerous part of the pandemic. The $5,000 threshold seemed arbitrary and did not align with our values.\n\nThis brings us to the second principle, aligning Canadian values with design parameters. Nowhere in the Canadian value system can we find a stipulation that pandemic benefits should only be given to those who earned over $5,000. Canadians believe in helping individuals who have lost their jobs, as evident through programs like EI and welfare. The $5,000 threshold seemed to come out of nowhere and did not align with our values.\n\nMoving on to the third principle, understanding benefit structure. The CERB and CRB were innovative, but it's difficult to determine if they reached the intended recipients. The rules kept changing, such as what counted as income, who was eligible, when the benefits were paid, and how they were paid. It's hard to say if the CERB and CRB violated the principle of understanding benefit structure because there was simply not enough time to thoroughly study it.\n\nLastly, the fourth principle is perhaps the most important - understanding the four elements of an income test. In the case of the CERB and CRB, there is no recovery or tax back rate on income. It's a binary system where you are either eligible or ineligible. Missing the threshold by even one cent makes you ineligible, while adding a cent makes you eligible. This lack of an on and off ramp, which is present in other income-tested benefits like GIS, CCB, CWB, and all income assistance programs, goes against a fundamental principle of design, even when designing under time constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, while there were some shortcomings in the design of the CERB and CRB programs, it's important to recognize the challenges faced in creating such programs during a crisis. We can learn from these experiences and use them to improve future benefit design efforts. END"}

By creating projects that connect people to their destinations, we help commuters save valuable time and money. Additionally, these initiatives generate good jobs for the middle class and contribute to a cleaner environment for future generations.\n\nToday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, along with Quebec Premier François Legault, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, and Charles Emond, President and CEO of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, gathered in Montreal for the launch of Phase 1 of the Réseau express métropolitain (REM), a significant public transit project that links multiple suburbs to downtown Montreal.\n\nWith the launch of Phase 1, five stations now provide public transit services from Brossard Station on the south shore to Central Station in downtown Montreal, crossing the iconic Samuel de Champlain Bridge over the St. Lawrence River. This project, the largest of its kind in Quebec in the past 50 years, is the result of extensive partnership, including a record investment from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.\n\nOnce fully completed, the REM will double the length of the existing metro system and connect the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue) and the North Shore (Laval and Deux-Montagnes) to downtown Montreal. It will also provide a rapid link to Montreal-Trudeau International Airport, reducing travel time from downtown to the airport to just 25 minutes, regardless of traffic. \n\nThe REM, which operates as a fully electric metro, will significantly cut emissions by 100,000 tonnes per year – equivalent to removing 30,000 cars from our roads on a daily basis. It is expected to boost the Greater Montreal area's economy, creating 34,000 jobs during construction and 1,000 permanent jobs. Additionally, over $2 billion in wages will be paid in Quebec as a result of this project. The REM is projected to accommodate up to 170,000 users per day.\n\nProjects like the REM are crucial to our efforts to combat climate change, create high-quality jobs, and improve our communities. Today's announcement means that Montrealers will experience faster commutes, spend less time in traffic, breathe cleaner air, and have more money in their pockets.\n\nTo summarize:\n1. Phase 1 of the REM allows approximately 30,000 commuters per day to travel 16.6 kilometers in just 18 minutes.\n2. Upon completion, the REM will add 26 stations and 67 kilometers of tracks, doubling the length of Montreal's current metro system.\n3. The Canada Infrastructure Bank is investing a record-breaking $1.28 billion into the REM project and an additional $300 million for the construction of the REM terminus station at Montreal-Trudeau International Airport. The Government of Canada's Airport Critical Infrastructure Program is also investing an extra $100 million in the airport's REM station.\n4. The total project cost for the REM is currently $6.9 billion, made possible through collaboration between the Government of Canada, CDPQ Infra, REM Inc., the Government of Quebec, Aéroports de Montréal, and Hydro-Québec.\n5. Established in 2017, the Canada Infrastructure Bank seeks to invest in large-scale, transformative infrastructure projects that generate revenue and benefit the public, promote clean economic growth, and contribute to the sustainability of Canada's infrastructure.\n6. Since 2015, the Government of Canada has invested over $22 billion in more than 1,800 public transit projects across the country. These investments will result in the construction of over 400 kilometers of new subway and light rail lines, the purchase of over 3,000 zero-emission buses, and the creation of almost 1,700 kilometers of active transportation trails, bike lanes, and recreational paths.

We collaborated with various departments, including Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Veterans Affairs Canada, and Statistics Canada, to explore how users interact with the global theme and topic menu on Canada.ca. Our goal was to address the concerns raised by some institutions regarding the menu's ability to meet their complex navigation needs, which was preventing them from adopting the Canada.ca design.\n\nTo find a solution, we went beyond the menu and examined overall navigation habits to ensure that institutions could effectively meet user needs. The wayfinding project included a baseline study to identify and assess findability issues, as well as a comparison study to test potential solutions. The insights gained from this research have informed changes to the Canada.ca design.\n\nDuring our research and prototyping activities, we explored options to remove the menu while still maintaining or improving the effectiveness of global navigation. We wanted to preserve the trust and confidence that users have in the Canada.ca site brand. Our prototype included several design elements for testing:\n\n1. A global header without a menu\n2. Theme links from the menu moved to the footer\n3. A sign-in button in the global header\n4. More prominent breadcrumb links\n5. A simplified theme page template\n\nWe applied the new design to pages that were already using the Canada.ca design, as well as pages that weren't. Task success remained consistent, and there was even an improvement in navigating between themes. Breadcrumbs were found to be more frequently used than the global menu for navigation, as they provide clear links to theme-level pages, leading users directly to their desired destination. Additionally, we discovered that people often use the menu to find a way to sign in to their accounts. To address this, we placed a contextual sign-in button at the top-right, just below the global header, where users typically expect to find it. This change proved successful in our testing.\n\nBy implementing these design changes, we were able to maintain or improve task success rates in the comparison round of testing. For more detailed information, please refer to our research summary.\n\nWe understand that these are significant changes to a website that people rely on daily. To minimize disruption, we are taking a transitional approach to implement these design improvements to our navigation. Some work has already been completed, and we are currently working on the remaining updates.\n\nHere is our roll-out plan:\n\n1. Updates to the Canada.ca homepage: After analyzing usage patterns, we found that certain footer links were frequently used on the homepage but rarely accessed elsewhere on the site. To make these links more visible and free up space in the footer, we have moved them into the content section of the Canada.ca homepage.\n\n2. Contextual sign-in button: The global header now includes an optional contextual sign-in button. This button will be displayed on pages where users are likely looking to sign in to their accounts. We observed that many users accessed the sign-in page through the global menu. By presenting the sign-in button in the top-right of the content area, signing in becomes more obvious and easy to find. As users become accustomed to seeing and using the sign-in button consistently, they will rely less on the menu for accessing their accounts.\n\n3. Footer updates: To further reduce dependency on the theme and topic menu, we have made adjustments to the global footer. The new global footer will consist of three content bands.\n\nWe hope that these changes will enhance the user experience and make navigating the government of Canada's website easier and more efficient.

Organizations often use them to promote new activities, initiatives, programs, and services. It can be tempting to use carousels when you have multiple requests for promotional space, as they allow you to showcase different promotions to different segments of your audience. However, it's important to note that carousels are not very effective at engaging users. People simply don't click on them. Let's explore why this is the case and how you can design content that is more successful at reaching your audience.\n\nOne reason why carousels are not effective is due to something called \"banner blindness.\" People tend to ignore ads, and carousels can resemble advertisements, causing users to scroll past them without giving them much attention. Thinking that your content will be noticed simply because it is in a carousel is incorrect. In fact, a study conducted in 2016 found that participants barely looked at anything beyond the bottom corner of the carousel, and they only read the first few words of the caption. This behavior was consistent across different pages. Based on this study, we made the decision to stop using carousels on the home page of Canada.ca and other top-level navigation pages. We also observed the same behavior when working with Global Affairs Canada in 2019 to improve travel tasks. An appealing graphic featured in their carousel at the top of the page went unnoticed by 89% of participants. However, when we removed the carousel and added a text link called \"Planning Your Trip\" within the page, 100% of people successfully followed the link and found the checklist.\n\nAnother reason why people avoid carousels is their movement. Carousels can be distracting, and users may not have enough time to finish reading the text before the slide changes. This can be frustrating and counterproductive. Accessibility and inclusivity should be prioritized in design, ensuring that content is accessible to a wide range of people, including those with physical and cognitive disabilities.\n\nDespite the drawbacks, there are situations where carousels can be effective. For example, they can work well on a page designed as an image gallery. This is why we have kept the carousel pattern in the Canada.ca design system but have updated the guidance on when and how to use it. It's important to understand that carousels should not be the go-to choice for promotional purposes.\n\nSo, how can you do effective promotions without relying on carousels? Start by considering user behavior and outcomes. Tailor your message to the visitor based on where they are on the site. Ensure that your promotions are closely related to the content of the page.

However, it can be challenging to prioritize user needs when faced with tight deadlines and financial constraints. Understanding who your users are and how your service impacts their lives is crucial for creating effective digital services. One valuable resource for gaining insights into user experiences is your call centre. Call centre agents have access to valuable feedback, including complaints, praises, and product insights from your diverse audience. Whether you have an in-house call centre or outsource to a trusted partner, involving agents can help you improve your web content and services with real people in mind.\n\nLet me provide an example of how collaborating with call centre staff helped us quickly enhance our service on canada.ca. In March 2020, there was a surge in calls and emails related to employment insurance (EI) and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). The high volume of inquiries overwhelmed the Government of Canada's main helpline and email managed by Service Canada, causing delays and frustration for concerned Canadians. To address this issue, Service Canada sought assistance from the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) to improve their phone and email contact pages. The goal was to encourage more self-service options on the website, building on our successful experience with the Canada Revenue Agency.\n\nWe used web analytics and call volumes in early April 2020 to measure the effectiveness of our interventions. At that time, call wait times exceeded several hours, and many people couldn't get through. Email response times were also delayed beyond the standard 48-hour window. The public health agency's call centre had to transfer hundreds of calls daily regarding CERB and EI topics alone.\n\nTo address these challenges, we focused on designing the contact page based on user behavior. The original page had a lengthy alert at the top about call wait times and included links to other pages. However, we suspected that people were not reading the long alert and were reluctant to leave the contact page because they had already made up their minds about needing assistance. We hypothesized that they didn't feel compelled to search for answers elsewhere since the helpline phone number was readily available.\n\nTo test our ideas, we created prototypes and conducted user testing. First, we tried a smaller alert banner at the top of the page, reducing the length and removing the distracting links. The new alert simply encouraged people to check the information on the page before contacting support. Second, we implemented an expand\/collapse pattern, displaying answers to frequently asked questions at the top of the page. Users could expand only the answer they needed, eliminating the need to leave the page. This approach allowed us to keep the page concise while providing the most essential content.\n\nThe results of our testing were positive. People actively searched for answers on the page and found them. By optimizing the contact page based on user behavior, we were able to improve the user experience and reduce the burden on call centres. END"}

The purpose of this revision is to include a new restriction on the use of personal mobile devices during instructional time. However, we want to assure you that the use of personal mobile devices during instructional time is still permitted under certain circumstances.\n\nFirstly, students may use their personal mobile devices for educational purposes as directed by an educator. Secondly, they may use them for health and medical purposes. Lastly, personal mobile devices may be used to support special education needs. It is important to note that school boards have a duty under the Ontario Human Rights Code to provide appropriate accommodations to all students and employees, including educators. If someone requires the use of a personal mobile device as an accommodation, school boards are obligated to allow it.\n\nFurthermore, this memorandum provides guidance to school boards on reviewing their own codes of conduct as well as the local codes of conduct in their schools. It is essential that boards review their codes of conduct to ensure that they align with the revised provincial code of conduct. Additionally, we would like to draw your attention to subsection 301(2) of Part XIII of the Education Act, which outlines the purposes of the provincial code of conduct. According to subsection 301(3.1), if a board enters into an agreement with a third party regarding the rental of school space or the provision of before- and after-school programs, the agreement must include a requirement for the other party to follow standards consistent with the provincial code of conduct.\n\nA positive school environment is one that promotes responsibility, respect, civility, and academic excellence within a safe learning and teaching environment. We believe that a positive school climate can be achieved when all members of the school community feel safe, included, and accepted, and actively promote positive behaviors and interactions. Building and maintaining a positive school climate is indeed a complex challenge, but one that can be met with evidence-informed solutions. A whole-school approach, involving all members of the school community, is crucial in supporting efforts to create safe, inclusive, and accepting schools. This approach is effective in making systemic changes that benefit all students and the broader community.\n\nAll students, parents, teachers, and other school staff have the right to be safe and feel safe within their school community. With this right comes the responsibility to contribute to a positive school climate. To foster such a climate that supports student achievement and well-being, we recommend that school boards focus on prevention and early intervention strategies to address inappropriate behavior. The provincial code of conduct sets clear standards of behavior that apply to students in various settings – whether they are on school property, in a virtual learning environment, on school buses, at school-related events or activities, in before- and after-school programs, or in any other circumstances that may affect the school climate. These standards also apply to all individuals involved in the publicly funded school system, including principals, teachers, early childhood educators, other school staff, parents, school bus drivers, volunteers, and members of various community groups.\n\nResponsible citizenship entails appropriate participation in the civic life of the school community. Active and engaged citizens are not only aware of their rights, but they also accept the responsibility of protecting their rights and the rights of others.\n\nIn light of these requirements, we ask that all school boards ensure their codes of conduct are:\n\n1. Up to date and consistent with the provincial code of conduct outlined in this memorandum.\n2. Compliant with all Ministry of Education policies, as well as the requirements of the Education Act, its regulations, and all other applicable legislation, including the Ontario Human Rights Code.\n3. Made available to the public, either on the school board's website or through another appropriate means, if the board does not have a website.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. We believe that by working together, we can create safe, inclusive, and accepting school communities that promote student success and well-being.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name] END"}

This reminder comes after an auditor-general's report found that certain developers were favored by the government's removal of lands from the protected greenbelt. The memo, signed by Premier Doug Ford's chief of staff, Patrick Sackville, and Ontario's top civil servant, Secretary of the Cabinet Michelle Diemanuele, was shared with reporters to ensure transparency.\n\nThe memo highlights the importance of following the Public Service of Ontario Act, which includes rules regarding conflict of interest and political activity. Public servants are reminded to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. It also mentions that a comprehensive response to the auditor's report is being prepared, with a working group overseeing its implementation.\n\nThe purpose of the memo is to address several recommendations made by Auditor-General Bonnie Lysyk. Lysyk's report stated that the greenbelt decision was biased and seriously flawed, lacking necessary environmental and financial analysis. The government has accepted all but one of her recommendations, which involves revisiting the greenbelt decision itself.\n\nIn the memo, ministers' chiefs of staff are cautioned that proposals submitted to cabinet or its committees must provide accurate and complete information, including options and risks. It also emphasizes the importance of consultation, including with indigenous leaders. Lysyk had previously pointed out that vital details about the greenbelt proposal were missing, and that the land selection was mostly done by Ryan Amato, the chief of staff to the Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister, rather than apolitical civil servants. The report revealed that Amato, appointed by the premier's office, received submissions from developers that accounted for the majority of the removals from the greenbelt.\n\nThe premier's office, in response to another recommendation, has asked the integrity commissioner to investigate if Amato broke any rules in his dealings with developers. Lysyk's report also highlighted the use of strict non-disclosure agreements, which prevented civil servants involved in the greenbelt decision from consulting municipalities or experts. Chiefs of staff are now required to report any proposed use of confidentiality agreements to the cabinet office or the treasury board secretariat. The memo also reminds them to follow existing requirements to document any materials or proposals received from external sources.\n\nThe opposition NDP dismissed the memo as government spin, claiming that the government is attempting to deflect blame for the greenbelt removals. They accuse Premier Doug Ford and Housing Minister Steve Clark of being wholly responsible for the corrupt actions. Despite the criticism, the government remains firm in their decision to remove 3,000 hectares from the protected greenbelt. Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy defended the decision, stating that it was necessary due to the housing crisis and the influx of new residents to the province.\n\nThe release of the memo coincided with Finance Minister Bethlenfalvy's announcement of the province's first-quarter financial results. He addressed concerns raised by reporters and reiterated the government's stance on the greenbelt removal. Despite expert reports suggesting that there was already enough land for housing, Bethlenfalvy presented recent numbers indicating a significant increase in the province's population. END"}

I am a resident and a voter in Scarborough North. I have been studying social and economic policy for quite some time now. In fact, I have lived in northern Scarborough for a remarkable 44 years. \n\nIn the new millennium, I had the privilege of serving as president of a Canadian non-profit board and as chair of an Ontario agency. Currently, I am honored to chair an Ontario commission. Through these experiences, I have gained a deep understanding of what it's like to live within government rules and constraints. \n\nHowever, I firmly believe that we still have choices, even within these constraints. It seems to me that you have only apologized for the limitations under which you must operate, rather than making proactive choices. As someone who has witnessed numerous electoral boundary changes, I can confidently say that in 2018, Scarborough achieved a level of electoral transparency and fairness that we had never seen before. For the first time in living memory, all our Scarborough electoral boundaries across different levels of government became aligned.\n\nAnd yet, now your commission is proposing changes not only within Scarborough, but also to Scarborough's own boundaries. This suggestion comes after the electoral boundary changes made in 2013. These moves not only diminish our participation in democracy in Scarborough, but they also reduce Toronto's overall involvement. \n\nAt the Scarbrough Community Renewal Organization (SCRO), we do understand why you are proposing these changes. We comprehend the algorithm for change, the shifts in population, and the constraints you face in proposing new boundaries and a reduction in seats. However, whether other boundaries remain the same or change, it inevitably leads to either confusion or upheaval. It's a challenging situation to navigate.\n\nIf provincial and municipal boundaries change, it brings about more upheaval. On the other hand, if they remain the same, the boundaries fall out of sync. Trying to find the balance is no easy task. \n\nI won't delve into the grave and damaging consequences of the proposed changes, as I'm sure you are aware of them. But let me touch on some key points highlighted in recent media reports. Since 2011, the population of the City of Toronto has grown by more than 179,000 residents. To put that in perspective, that's more people than live in Prince Edward Island. Yet, PEI is represented by four seats in the House of Commons and will maintain that number in the next election. Despite adding more people than the population of PEI, Toronto is set to lose a seat.\n\nOver the past decade, Ontario has welcomed almost two million new residents, which is greater than the combined populations of New Brunswick and Saskatchewan. For a population of around 1.2 million, Saskatchewan has 14 seats, meaning approximately 84,000 residents per riding. Similarly, New Brunswick, with 789,225 people, has 10 seats, averaging around 79,000 people per riding. Meanwhile, in 2011, Ontario, with 12.9 million people, was entitled to 121 seats, or around 106,000 people per riding. So, after growing by almost two million people, how many new seats is Ontario gaining? Just one.\n\nThe commission explains that it must reduce Toronto's districts by one but add two outside the city limits due to faster population growth in the suburbs. The objective is to correct significant disparities in voter equality that have emerged across the province in the past decade, as stated by Justice Lynne Leitch, the commission's chairperson.\n\nWith this proposed change, Scarborough-Agincourt is being split up, redistributing a substantial part of our community into North York and erasing any reference to the historical neighborhood of Agincourt in the process. Moreover, Scarborough is losing an entire riding. This proposal eliminates a significant portion of Scarborough North and Scarborough-Agincourt, merging our community into a new riding called Scarborough Northwest.\n\nI hope this helps shed some light on the concerns we have regarding the proposed changes. We understand the complexities you face in making these decisions, but it's important to carefully consider the impact they may have on our community and the overall participation of Toronto. Thank you for taking the time to listen. END"}

This update includes a new rule regarding the use of personal mobile devices during instructional time. We want to emphasize that this restriction has been put in place for a positive reason - to create a more focused learning environment.\n\nHowever, we understand that there are certain circumstances where the use of personal mobile devices can be beneficial. Therefore, we have outlined three exceptions to this rule:\n\n1. Personal mobile devices are allowed for educational purposes when directed by an educator.\n2. They can also be used for health and medical reasons.\n3. Personal mobile devices are permitted to support special education needs.\n\nWe would like to remind school boards that, as per the Ontario Human Rights Code, it is their duty to provide the necessary accommodations to students and employees. Therefore, if someone requires the use of a personal mobile device as an accommodation, it must be allowed.\n\nIn addition to this, we would like to offer guidance on reviewing your own codes of conduct, as well as the local codes of conduct within your schools. It is important to ensure that these codes are consistent with the revised provincial code of conduct.\n\nWe would like to bring your attention to subsection 301 (2) of part XIII of the Education Act, which outlines the purposes of the provincial code of conduct. According to subsection 301 (3.1), if the board enters into an agreement with a third party for the rental of school space or the provision of before- and after-school programs, that party must adhere to standards consistent with the provincial code of conduct.\n\nA school should always strive to be a place that promotes responsibility, respect, civility, and academic excellence within a safe learning and teaching environment. A positive school climate can be achieved when all members of the school community feel safe, included, accepted, and actively promote positive behaviors and interactions.\n\nCreating and maintaining a positive school climate is a complex challenge that requires evidence-informed solutions. It is crucial to adopt a whole-school approach involving all members of the school community to ensure safety, inclusivity, and acceptance. This approach is effective in making systemic changes that benefit all students and the broader community.\n\nEvery student, parent, teacher, and school staff member has the right to feel safe and be safe within their school community. Along with this right comes the responsibility to contribute to a positive school climate. School boards should focus on prevention and early intervention strategies to address inappropriate behavior and foster a positive school climate that supports student achievement and well-being.\n\nThe provincial code of conduct sets clear standards of behavior that apply to students in various settings, including school property, virtual learning environments, school buses, school-related events or activities, before- and after-school programs, and any other circumstances that may impact the school climate. These standards also extend to all individuals involved in the publicly-funded school system, such as principals, teachers, early childhood educators, other school staff, parents, school bus drivers, volunteers, and members of various community groups.\n\nUltimately, responsible citizenship involves active participation in the civic life of the school community. Engaged citizens not only understand their rights but also accept the responsibility of protecting their own rights and the rights of others.\n\nThank you for your attention to these matters. We believe that by working together, we can create a positive and safe learning environment for all.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name] END"}

It's not uncommon for communities across Canada to experience wildfire smoke events, and unfortunately, this is expected to continue. Canada is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the world, which creates ideal conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting wildfires. \n\nWildfire season typically runs from early April to late October, and during this time, the fires can produce dense smoke. Unfortunately, it's difficult to predict when fires will occur, how big they will be, how much smoke they will generate, or what direction the smoke will travel. In fact, smoke from wildfires can be carried hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from the fire zone, which means communities in Canada can be impacted by smoke from other parts of the world. \n\nCertain groups of people are at higher risk of health problems when exposed to wildfire smoke, including seniors, pregnant individuals, smokers, infants and young children, those who work outdoors, people involved in strenuous outdoor exercise, and those with existing illnesses or chronic health conditions. However, it's important to note that during heavy smoke conditions, everyone is at risk, regardless of age or health. \n\nIf you find yourself in a wildfire smoke event, it's crucial to take care when spending time outdoors. Check local air quality conditions regularly to determine if it's safe to be outside. Pay attention to the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), special air quality statements, and other indicators of smoke levels in your community. Limit outdoor activities and strenuous physical exercise as much as possible. If you experience any symptoms, listen to your body and reduce or stop activities accordingly. \n\nTo ensure clean air in your home, stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed. If it's too warm, consider using air conditioning if available. If you don't have air conditioning, and it's too warm to keep windows closed, seek out local cooling or clean air spaces. You can also use a portable air purifier in a room where you spend a lot of time to decrease the fine particles from wildfire smoke. Additionally, limit the use of exhaust fans when not cooking. If you can't maintain cool, clean air inside your home, be aware of locations in your community where you can find clean air and take a break from the smoke. Libraries, shopping malls, community centers, and cleaner air shelters are typically safe places with air conditioning and filtered air. For the most up-to-date information on publicly accessible locations, contact your local health or emergency authorities.\n\nIt's common to feel anxious, stressed, sad, or isolated during a smoke event. Taking care of yourself by eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising indoors, and staying in contact with friends can help alleviate these feelings. If you're struggling to cope with symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression, don't hesitate to seek help from a healthcare provider. Remember, although a wildfire smoke event may last awhile, it will eventually come to an end. Maintaining a positive outlook and attitude will help you get through it.\n\nIf you must spend time outdoors, consider wearing a well-fitted respirator type mask, such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator. These masks can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke, which pose the greatest risk to health. However, it's essential to note that respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases present in wildfire smoke. Listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you experience symptoms. If smoke persists for more than a few days, try to stay active when you can. Find a place with clean air to exercise indoors, like a gym, community center, or even your own home. If you need to work outdoors, consult with your provincial or territorial occupational health and safety organization or your local health authority. They can provide guidance on how to work safely outdoors during wildfire smoke events. END"}

Although COVID-19 has made these challenges even more difficult, it has also provided youth with more free time, which has led to a rise in entrepreneurship. Now, young people are looking to governments for assistance in expanding their networks, accessing entry-level opportunities, addressing their student debt, and ensuring equal opportunities for everyone.\n\nBarriers to employment:\nMany obstacles hinder young people's access to employment, such as a lack of technology, professional networks, and career development opportunities. Unfortunately, these barriers disproportionately affect those from low-income or marginalized communities. Additionally, it is problematic when young people cannot find work in their preferred language due to a lack of suitable job opportunities. \"If you don't have a strong network, it's harder to access certain opportunities.\"\n\nCareer aspirations:\nYouth express a need for stability, work-life balance, and relevant work experiences. However, with the difficulty of finding entry-level jobs, they struggle to envision their potential career paths. \"If I wanted a more casual job, I could probably get one. A career seems like a completely different situation because I don't have any college, job, or university experience.\" Many young people are choosing to delay graduation or pursue further education due to the increased stress of unemployment.\n\nCOVID-19:\nThe pandemic has made job opportunities scarce and highly competitive, leading young people to feel demotivated and stressed. Moreover, the lack of social interaction has taken a toll on individuals' mental well-being. \"Remote work removes the social outlet that many people used to have and affects those with limited social interaction.\"\n\nPositive impacts:\nDespite the challenges, the lack of employment opportunities has pushed many young people to start their own companies and initiatives. \"I was searching for a job right before COVID-19. All the opportunities were cancelled, but I was able to build my own company because of it.\"\n\nFinancial concerns:\nYouth are struggling to make ends meet as the cost of education continues to rise, and entry-level salaries are insufficient to repay student loans. This financial stress negatively affects their academic performance. \"The cost of education compared to the wages for these jobs is misaligned. My generation spent over $50,000 on education with the promise of well-paying jobs, which is not the case and hinders our financial stability.\"\n\nEquity:\nThere is a concerning number of unemployed youth with disabilities who worry that potential employers view them as expensive to accommodate. \"Will employers see me as costly because of my disability?\" Additionally, young people from low-income communities struggle to build professional networks, which hampers their job prospects. Discrimination in the workplace also contributes to pay gaps and unequal chances for advancement.\n\nConclusion:\nYoung people face various challenges in finding meaningful employment, and there are significant inequalities across different groups. Governments must provide ongoing support to help youth secure entry-level jobs that offer growth opportunities and career development. This assistance should include aid in building professional networks, finding internships, developing 21st-century skills, and managing finances. It is important for governments to promote programs that address these essential areas, encourage entrepreneurship, and identify and rectify employment inequities among diverse groups. END"}

We will explore both the positive and negative aspects of these factors and provide recommendations to help young people access better resources and learn in more stable environments.\n\nTechnology Accessibility: Technology accessibility and online engagement offer important benefits to young people. For example, it eliminates the need to constantly move around to meet others or access services, which saves energy and resources. However, internet speed and the cost of services can be a hindrance, particularly in rural and remote communities. Additionally, working from home may pose challenges in terms of technology access and home environment. On a positive note, it can also provide a sense of greater independence and reduced social anxiety.\n\nEducation: Education plays a significant role in the lives of Canadian youth. Pursuing post-secondary education can lead to better income opportunities in the future. However, education can be expensive, and many young people still feel the need to be better prepared for the workforce even after leaving school. Youth are seeking unique opportunities to explore their individual identities and apply their interests and skills. It's worth noting that students engaged in community development initiatives and entrepreneurial pursuits may take longer to graduate or complete their education. Students with disabilities also tend to graduate later than their peers. Access to French-language schools in minority communities can be challenging, leading to disparities between French and English programs. Initiatives like Mitacs provide pathways for entrepreneurship and innovation among post-secondary students, but their impact is limited due to scope. Underrepresented undergraduate students also aspire to gain hands-on experiences in entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nEquity: Access to education and its quality depend on factors like location and wealth. Indigenous youth, in particular, face low rates of completing post-secondary education due to cultural differences in learning, transportation challenges, and lack of support systems. Young people want to contribute solutions to society's problems and be part of driving change. Youth-led organizations should be seen as valuable assets rather than liabilities. They seek opportunities to contribute to \"building back better\" and be recognized as essential for achieving equity.\n\nMental Health: COVID-19 has significantly affected mental health and education. The pandemic has increased workloads and made it difficult for learners to acquire the necessary skills for a smooth transition to virtual learning. Opportunities for social interactions have also been limited, making it harder to form friendships and build strong relationships. Some young people have experienced toxic family environments due to increased time spent at home. On the flip side, the pandemic has allowed individuals to learn important skills like time management and self-discipline. Prioritizing mental health in schools is crucial, as many young people feel immense pressure to succeed and choose the \"right\" courses. Some may even feel pressured to pursue post-secondary education without genuine interest. Mental health issues can distract from the ability to develop necessary learning outcomes for advancement.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are challenges, there are also opportunities for young people in the areas of innovation, skills and learning technology, education, equity, and mental health. By addressing these challenges and providing support, we can empower young people to thrive and contribute to a better future for all. END"}

This speech serves as an introduction to the government's direction and goals, outlining their plans for achieving them. In order for the Senate and the House of Commons to conduct public business, it is essential for Canada's head of state or their representative to read the speech.\n\nTraditionally, the Governor General, as the Queen's representative in Canada, reads the speech from the throne. However, on two occasions in 1957 and 1977, the Queen herself was present in Canada and personally delivered the speech. It is referred to as the Speech from the Throne because the Governor General reads it from the seat - or the throne - in the Senate chamber, which is reserved for the Queen or her representative in Canada. During the reading of the speech, members of the House of Commons, Senators, Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, and other invited guests are in attendance.\n\nThe Governor General has two crucial roles in the opening of a new session of parliament. First, on the advice of the Prime Minister, the Governor General issues a proclamation summoning parliament. This proclamation is necessary for the Senate and the House of Commons to officially begin a session of parliament. Additionally, the Governor General reads the speech that is prepared by the government. They may also add their own introduction to the speech, outlining their own activities.\n\nThe Usher of the Black Rod, a senior parliamentary officer, plays an important role in the Senate chamber. Appointed by the Governor General upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister, the Usher of the Black Rod has various ceremonial and security-related responsibilities in support of the Senate. One of their duties includes assisting in the delivery of the Speech from the Throne, which is read in the Senate. Before the Governor General reads the speech, the Usher of the Black Rod leaves the Senate chamber and knocks three times with the Black Rod on the doors of the House of Commons. This signals to the members of Parliament that they are being called to the Senate chamber. The position of the Usher of the Black Rod traces its origins back to approximately 600 years ago in England. In Canada, the title \"Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod\" was used until 1997 when Mary C. McLaren became the first woman to hold the position. Since then, the title used in Canada has been gender-neutral.\n\nAfter the Governor General delivers the Speech from the Throne, the new session of parliament officially begins. Public business can now commence in both the Senate and the House of Commons. The first order of business is for the Prime Minister to introduce Bill C-1 in the House of Commons. Similarly, a Senator introduces a corresponding bill, Bill S-1, in the Senate.

We are thrilled to take the next step in our journey by bringing Copilot to more customers and adding new features. Additionally, we are sharing new data and insights from our 2023 Work Trend Index, which explores how work is evolving in the age of AI.\n\nSince March, we have been testing Copilot with 20 enterprise customers, including Chevron, Goodyear, General Motors, and Dow. Their feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with many stating that Copilot has the potential to revolutionize the way we work. They have highlighted how it is a game-changer for meetings and is starting to transform their creative processes. They have also provided valuable suggestions on how we can further assist people in adapting to this new way of working, such as the need for more natural and interactive conversations. As we continue to make Copilot available to more customers, we will rely on this feedback to refine the tool and guide users as they adapt to this innovative approach.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce the Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program. This invitation-only, paid preview will initially roll out to 600 customers worldwide. Additionally, to help every customer prepare for AI integration, we will introduce the Semantic Index for Copilot, a new feature available in Microsoft 365 E3 and E5. The Semantic Index is a sophisticated map of user and company data. For instance, when you inquire about the \"March sales report,\" it not only searches for files with those words in the name or body but also comprehends that sales reports are created by Kelly on the finance team using Excel. This knowledge allows Copilot to determine your intent and help you find the information you need. The Semantic Index for Copilot is crucial for providing relevant and actionable responses. Furthermore, it enhances enterprise search results for E3 and E5 customers, whether they use Copilot or not.\n\nThe 2023 Work Trend Index reveals that the shift towards AI in the workplace is well underway. Just as customers turned to Microsoft for assistance with the transition to remote and flexible work, they now seek our guidance on how AI will further transform work. Our survey, which involved 31,000 people across 31 countries, and the analysis of productivity signals in Microsoft 365 and labor market trends on LinkedIn, provides valuable insights into the impact of AI on work.\n\nThe data clearly shows that the pace and volume of work have significantly increased, and employees are struggling to keep up, jeopardizing innovation. Both leaders and employees are eager for AI to alleviate this burden. Satya Nadella, Chairman, and CEO of Microsoft said, \"This new generation of AI will remove the drudgery of work and unleash creativity. There is a great opportunity for AI-powered tools to help reduce digital debt, enhance AI skills, and empower employees.\"\n\nThe report highlights three important insights that business leaders should consider when adopting AI responsibly. Firstly, digital debt is impeding innovation. The overwhelming amount of data, emails, and chats has surpassed our capacity to handle them effectively. Every minute spent managing this digital debt takes away from valuable creative work. In a world where creativity drives productivity, digital debt is more than just an inconvenience – it negatively impacts businesses. When 62% of employees report spending too much time on information search, communication, and coordination, they have less time for deep thinking, creativity, and collaboration. Nearly two out of three employees state that they do not have enough time and energy to perform their jobs effectively. These employees are also 3.5 times more likely to struggle with innovation and strategic thinking. END"}

We are launching a brand new pilot program that allows residents and visitors who are 19 years of age or older to enjoy their own alcoholic beverages in 27 of our beautiful parks. This pilot will be up and running until Monday, October 9th.\n\nCouncillor Shelley Carroll, the chair of the Economic and Community Development Committee, along with city staff, were at Earlscourt Park this morning to officially introduce this two-month pilot program. If you'd like more information about the program, including the specific park locations, regulations, and restrictions, you can find all the details on the city's Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage.\n\nBack in July, Toronto City Council gave their approval for this program to run in parks that were carefully selected and confirmed in consultation with local councillors. You can find the details of the council's decision on the city's website. It's important to note that this pilot program is based on guidance from public health officials, as well as public safety and operational considerations. We've also taken into account the experiences of other Canadian cities that have implemented similar programs, such as Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton.\n\nAs park users, it is expected that you know and follow all applicable bylaws and legislation. This includes compliance with the Provincial Liquor Licence and Control Act, 2019, which prohibits public intoxication and serving alcohol to individuals under 19 years old. It's also important to remember that alcohol consumption is not allowed in parks that are not part of this pilot program. And of course, if you plan to sell or serve liquor in any park, you will still need to obtain the necessary permit and licence.\n\nTo ensure everyone's safety and enjoyment, there are a few important rules to follow. Please refrain from consuming alcohol within the boundary of an outdoor swimming pool or on the deck. Additionally, alcohol should not be consumed within two metres of playgrounds, wading pools, splash pads, or skateboard parks in the pilot program locations.\n\nWe are proud to be the first municipality in Ontario to introduce a pilot program like this since the province authorized it. We truly value the feedback and experiences of our park users and neighboring communities. To gather this feedback, we encourage you to report any concerns or observations through the 311 hotline, and we also have an online survey available on the city's Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage. The results of this evaluation will be presented to the council in early 2024.\n\nDuring the pilot program, our dedicated bylaw enforcement officers will be regularly visiting parks to educate people about the rules and city bylaws. They will continue to do so throughout Toronto, as part of their regular duties. Rest assured, the city will address any park complaints and prioritize investigations into matters that may pose risks to public use or become a nuisance.\n\nWe understand the importance of ensuring safe alcohol consumption, and we are working closely with Toronto Public Health to share information and tips. You can find information about health risks associated with alcohol and safer drinking suggestions on the city's Alcohol & Other Drugs webpage.\n\nIn the words of Councillor Shelley Carroll, \"We're thrilled to launch this sensible pilot and give residents the opportunity to enjoy their drinks responsibly in select public spaces.\" So please take a moment to visit the city's Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage, where you can find all the details about the program, a full list of participating parks, program guidelines, and useful tips for safe drinking and harm reduction. Remember, this pilot will run until October 9th, and we encourage everyone to share their valuable feedback through the online survey that is open now.\n\nToronto is a vibrant and diverse city, home to over three million people. Our city's diversity and experiences make it a leading economic hub in Canada and one of the most livable and diverse cities in the world. As the fourth-largest city in North America, Toronto takes pride in being a global leader in technology, finance, film, music, culture, innovation, and climate action.

The city is expanding the Fair Pass transit discount program to make transit more affordable for an additional 50,000 low-income individuals. Starting today, the program will prioritize residents between the ages of 20 and 64 who are living in deep poverty, such as low-wage workers, part-time workers, newcomers, and unemployed individuals receiving employment assistance. We are also extending the program to residents on the waitlist for subsidized housing and child care, providing immediate financial support for their transit costs.\n\nThe Fair Pass program offers a 12-month discount on TTC travel, including Wheel-Trans. Currently, the program provides a 36% discount on single adult fares (which amounts to $2.10 per fare) and a 21% discount on monthly passes (bringing the cost of an adult monthly pass to $123.25). To avail of these discounts, riders simply need to add a discount code to their Presto card.\n\nThis marks the beginning of the program's third phase, where any Toronto resident who meets the age and income criteria can receive the discount. Based on the latest thresholds, a single individual with an after-tax income below $20,514 or a family of four with an income below $41,028 would be eligible for the discount. While the income threshold has been temporarily reduced to 75% of the low-income measure, the program aims to return to the original threshold of the low-income measure plus 15% as soon as possible.\n\nIf you receive assistance through Ontario Works (OW), the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), or a Toronto child care fee subsidy, you can continue providing your program identification number when applying for the Fair Pass program. For all other applicants, you will need to provide income documents to assess your financial eligibility. Applying for the Fair Pass program is easy – you can do it online or by calling 416-338-8888.\n\nTo make it even more convenient for residents to get a Presto card when applying for the Fair Pass program, we have partnered with the Toronto Public Library's complimentary Presto card initiative. Free Presto cards are available at participating library branches while supplies last.\n\nThe Fair Pass program is a key initiative of the city's poverty reduction strategy, approved by Toronto City Council in 2016. It aims to make transit more affordable for low-income adult residents. If you want more information about the city's poverty reduction strategy, you can find it on the city's webpage.\n\nThis expansion of the Fair Pass program is the third time eligibility has been extended. Phase one in 2018 included OW and ODSP recipients, and in 2019, the program expanded to include Toronto Children's Services' child care fee subsidy recipients. Just this year, it expanded again to include rent-geared-to-income (RGI) subsidy recipients.\n\nThe Fair Pass transit discount program directly targets low-income working-age adults in Toronto, providing them with a much-needed discount on TTC fares. We understand that low-income residents rely heavily on public transit to access essential services like education, employment, social and health services, and opportunities outside their immediate community. By offering a transit discount, the Fair Pass program helps alleviate some of the financial burdens that low-income residents face on a daily basis.\n\nToronto is a vibrant city with over three million residents, known for its diversity, economic strength, and livability. As the fourth-largest city in North America, we are recognized as a global leader in various fields, including technology, finance, film, music, culture, innovation, and climate action. These achievements are the result of the collective efforts of our government, residents, and businesses.\n\nWe are thrilled to expand the Fair Pass program and continue making Toronto an inclusive and accessible city for all.

We have made great progress by utilizing a housing first approach. In fact, in the month of May, we were able to help approximately 700 residents move from emergency shelters into permanent housing. This is the highest number we have seen in the past two years!\n\nAt all Toronto shelters, we prioritize the housing first approach. We believe that stable housing is the primary need for individuals or families experiencing homelessness. By focusing on this, we can ensure that our shelter services are effective and beneficial.\n\nWe are also applying the insights from the Dufferin Grove report to our outreach work and housing first approach. Our goal is to encourage individuals to move from encampments to the emergency shelter system and eventually into permanent supportive housing. Additionally, we are dedicated to strengthening our housing first approach by providing comprehensive case management and wrap-around support to individuals living outdoors.\n\nThe Dufferin Grove model, which was released earlier this year, has provided valuable recommendations for our encampment outreach efforts. We have agreed to implement the 23 recommendations outlined in the report. You can find the full report from the ombudsman here.\n\nToday, we are excited to release our report on the housing first approach for encampments at Dufferin Grove Park. This report examines the encampment outreach model that was implemented between August and December 2021. You can access the report on our website.\n\nThe Dufferin Grove model was successful in enhancing our outreach efforts at the park. By collaborating with community partners, we were able to provide comprehensive social and health services directly to the park, reducing barriers and prioritizing the needs of our clients. As a result, 90 individuals at Dufferin Grove Park had successful outcomes, including referrals to shelter programs, transitions to permanent housing, or family reunification. We also removed 101 tents or structures from the park, as all encampment occupants left voluntarily with successful outcomes.\n\nWe are now incorporating the learnings from the Dufferin Grove report into our approach for larger encampments. The best practices identified in the report are being used daily to inform our outreach efforts and the development of our interdepartmental service protocol for homeless people camping in public spaces.\n\nIt is important to note that there has been an unprecedented demand for shelter in Toronto. Since 2016, we have expanded the number of shelter spaces by 125%, from approximately 4,000 to 9,000 spaces needed daily. We are proud to provide more shelter beds per capita than any other municipality in Canada. However, despite adding over 1,000 shelter spaces last year, our system remains at capacity most nights.\n\nIn 2023, our outreach staff and community partners were successful in referring 352 occupants from encampments to the shelter system, and 57 people were able to move into successful housing tenancies. To replicate the success of the Dufferin Grove approach at other parks, we must have dedicated housing and shelter options available, a team of dedicated staff from various city divisions, local community partners, resident groups, and volunteers. Additionally, onsite community supports are crucial to providing the critical services needed. Finally, the park must have the appropriate size and location to allow city staff and partners to co-locate an intensive level of resources.\n\nWe are committed to addressing homelessness in Toronto and will continue to work towards providing the necessary support and resources to those in need. Together, we can make a positive impact on the lives of individuals experiencing homelessness. END"}

Their goal is to address the complex health and safety risks surrounding encampments, provide access to safer indoor spaces, address waste and debris removal, and ensure that shared-use spaces are accessible to everyone.\n\nToronto operates a system of over 1,500 parks and ravines as recreational spaces that benefit the community. Outreach efforts in these areas focus on engaging with individuals living in encampments and other outdoor areas, building trusting relationships, and addressing immediate health and safety needs while also assisting in finding permanent housing. Outreach staff visit different sites daily to work with encampment occupants, connecting them with shelter options and housing workers. This engagement process continues to provide ongoing support and access to services even after a person accepts an indoor space.\n\nThe city's Streets to Homes outreach team and partner agencies are available 24\/7, year-round, to proactively connect with people living outdoors. Their focus is on establishing supportive relationships and addressing immediate health and safety needs. They also provide support in finding and transitioning into shelter and housing. In 2022, Streets to Homes made approximately 1,277 referrals for indoor spaces, with 1,112 of those referrals coming from encampments.\n\nWhile the city cannot force individuals to use the services offered in shelters, they will continue to encourage people to consider the offers of shelter and housing options. All members of the community are welcome to use the city's parks and right-of-ways as long as they adhere to city bylaws. However, living in an encampment is a violation of city parks and streets and sidewalks bylaws. The decision to enforce trespassing is made only after outreach, engagement efforts, and referrals to indoor spaces have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe city acknowledges that it cannot address homelessness alone and calls for new and enhanced investments from the government of Canada and the province of Ontario. These investments are needed to complement the city's efforts in increasing the supply of deeply affordable rental housing with supports such as harm reduction and mental health services. Additionally, investments in homelessness prevention programs and poverty reduction measures are necessary to prevent more households from becoming homeless. The city has added an extra $1 million to its EPIC program (Eviction Prevention in Community) to enhance preventative measures, but further investment from government partners is needed.\n\nAll Toronto shelters operate under a housing-first approach, recognizing that stable housing is the primary need for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. In the past year, the city helped over 4,300 people transition from shelters to permanent housing. The city's shelter system has expanded from approximately 4,000 spaces in 2016 to around 9,000 beds across more than 100 locations today. Collaborative efforts with government partners have led to the construction of supportive housing that has helped thousands of people move from shelters into permanent homes. This year, an additional 1,200 supportive housing opportunities will become available.\n\nCity spending on housing has increased by 124% since 2014, and the 2023 budget allocates $618 million in direct support for housing initiatives, an increase of $341.9 million.

These sites can be found at Allan Gardens, Christie Pits Park, and Norwood Park. The decision to choose these locations was made in collaboration with Indigenous community members and leaders, who recognized the need for these sites in these specific areas. It is worth mentioning that additional sites are planned for the future.\n\nSacred fires have been used by Indigenous peoples for centuries for wellness, healing, and gatherings. Just as some individuals gather in churches, temples, mosques, or synagogues, Indigenous ceremonies take place on the land. Fire is seen as a sacred gift from the Creator and serves as a means of communication with the spirit world, ancestors, and creation. It holds significant importance in many ceremonies.\n\nThe creation of designated sacred fire sites builds upon the ongoing efforts of the city to improve access to land for Indigenous ceremonies. In 2021, Toronto City Council approved by-law amendments to establish a new classification for fees related to cultural fires, including sacred fires. This decision was made after extensive consultation with Toronto Fire Services (TFS), the Indigenous Affairs Office (IAO), and Indigenous communities. By creating a specific category for open-air burnings associated with cultural or religious practices, TFS can ensure compliance with the Ontario Fire Code while acknowledging the significance of Indigenous sacred fires and respecting the cultural and religious rights of other communities wishing to conduct similar open-air burns.\n\nTo guarantee the safety of the designated sacred fire sites, TFS will conduct annual inspections as mandated by the Ontario Fire Code. However, Indigenous community members can still hold sacred fires at other undesignated sites by contacting the IAO or TFS, who will ensure that safety inspections are conducted. Each sacred fire site has an Indigenous site facilitator from the community who has been actively involved in the development process. They collaborated with city staff to select the locations, provided input on necessary materials, and helped raise awareness within their communities. These site facilitators will continue to support community members as they access the sites, forming a circle of ongoing engagement and improvement of the sacred fire process.\n\nIt's important to note that due to the spiritual nature of sacred fires, permission from the elder or fire keeper is required to film or photograph any aspect of a ceremony. If footage of a sacred fire ceremony is shared, it is good practice to acknowledge that permission was granted by the elder and\/or fire keeper.\n\nThe creation of designated sacred fire sites in city parks aligns with Action 15 of the city's Reconciliation Action Plan, which seeks to remove barriers for Indigenous people in accessing sacred fires. These sites are also supported by articles within the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the calls to action outlined in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report.\n\nToronto boasts a population of over 2.9 million people, making it a diverse and thriving city.

Over the past three years, Apple has more than doubled its initial financial commitment, now totaling over $200 million. This long-term global effort aims to advance equity and expand opportunities for Black, Hispanic\/Latinx, and Indigenous communities.\n\nSince launching REJI in June 2020, Apple has been actively supporting education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform work across the United States. And now, their efforts have expanded to Australia, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. It's an incredible step forward at a crucial moment when protests against racial injustice have swept the nation.\n\nREJI builds upon Apple's ongoing work to create greater access to opportunity and promote equity for underserved groups. They have established a dedicated entity that deeply engages with schools and communities to accelerate progress. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, emphasizes the urgency of this work and their commitment to collaboration and a common sense of purpose.\n\nThrough REJI's education grants, Apple has already reached over 160,000 learners through in-person courses and out-of-school offerings. Additionally, they have committed over $50 million to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) to support science, technology, engineering, arts, and math opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of economic empowerment, REJI funds financial institutions that support Black, Hispanic\/Latinx, and Indigenous entrepreneurs and businesses. This includes venture capital firms, community development financial institutions, and minority depository institutions. These investments aim to break down barriers and provide much-needed support to underrepresented communities.\n\nFurthermore, REJI's criminal justice reform grants have made a significant impact by supporting legal services, safe housing, identification services, healthcare access, and other vital reentry services for over 19,000 justice-impacted individuals.\n\nLisa Jackson, Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, highlights the importance of continuing to build on the progress made and ensuring equitable opportunities for Black and Brown communities in the US and around the world.\n\nAs part of their expanding work, Apple has also announced a new partnership with the Brother's Keeper Alliance (MBKA), a program of the Obama Foundation. Through this partnership, Apple aims to close opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color. They will support training for community leaders and MBKA staff, expand programming, and strengthen the network through targeted community impact microgrants. It's a collaboration that aims to nurture creativity, foster innovation, and transform the lives of boys and young men of color across the country.\n\nLastly, Apple is committed to increasing their investments in minority-owned businesses. They have recently pledged an additional $25 million to three venture capital funds - Collab Capital, Harlem Capital, and VamosVentures. This brings their total venture capital support to $50 million and overall financing to mission-aligned diverse businesses and financial institutions to over $100 million. These investments are part of REJI's economic empowerment pillar, which focuses on addressing systemic barriers, creating opportunities, and providing funding to underrepresented communities and businesses of color.\n\nApple's dedication to this initiative is commendable, and their efforts will undoubtedly have a positive and lasting impact on creating a more just and equitable world. They remain committed to their values and will continue to expand their efforts to create opportunities, uplift communities, and build a better future for all. END"}

However, what unites all of them is their use of coding to share their passions with the world.\n\nFor first-time winners Asmi Jain, Yemi Agesin, and Marta Michelle Caliendo, coding is not only a chance to forge a unique career path but also an opportunity to help others. Asmi Jain, a 20-year-old student from India, created her winning playground after learning about her friend's uncle who underwent brain surgery and experienced eye misalignment and facial paralysis. Her playground tracks a user's eye movements as they follow a ball on the screen, aiming to strengthen the eye muscles. While the inspiration came from her friend's uncle, Jain hopes it can benefit individuals with various eye conditions and injuries. Her goal is to receive feedback, improve its user-friendliness, and release it on the app store. Ultimately, she wants to expand the app to strengthen all face muscles and transform it into a therapy tool that can be used at one's own pace.\n\nJain's motivation to use coding to solve healthcare problems stems from years of volunteering and helping others. She and fellow students even created a forum at her university to support classmates in overcoming challenging coding problems. Jain believes that being part of something greater motivates her to do better, and coding allows her to create solutions that help her friends and community, empowering her with a sense of independence.\n\nWhile moving to different countries during his upbringing might be seen as a burden, 21-year-old Yemi Agesin views it as a blessing. Living in Germany, Nigeria, Belgium, and England before returning to the United States enriched his understanding of the world. Agesin believes this experience helps him design and consider a wide range of perspectives when building things. His winning app playground combines his passions for sports and filmmaking, taking the form of a first-person baseball game. This achievement not only reflects his immediate plans, as he is currently writing and producing a film about a baseball player, but also his future aspirations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference provides a platform for students worldwide to showcase their talent and creativity through app development. The increased number of winners this year ensures more students can participate and receive recognition. Whether it's addressing healthcare issues or merging passions like sports and filmmaking, these young developers are using coding to make a positive impact on society. Their dedication, diversity, and innovation exemplify the transformative power of coding and inspire others to pursue their dreams. END"}

Since our founding in 1998, we have always prioritized operating our business responsibly, both environmentally and socially.\n\nWe are proud to say that Google has been carbon-neutral since 2007, and for the past three years, we have matched our entire electricity consumption with renewable energy sources. We are dedicated to making significant investments in affordable housing and have made important commitments to promote racial equity.\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, we recently issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds as part of a $10 billion debt offering. This is the largest sustainability or green bond ever issued by any company. Unlike traditional green bonds, these sustainability bonds support investments in both environmental and social initiatives, making them an exciting new asset class. The overwhelming demand from investors shows that there is a strong interest in this market.\n\nThe proceeds from these sustainability bonds will fund ongoing and new projects that contribute to environmental and social responsibility. By investing in these projects, our stakeholders and investors have the opportunity to join us in addressing critical issues and creating value for our communities and employees. These investments align with our mission and long-term goals.\n\nIn line with the principles of green bonds and social bonds, the proceeds will be allocated to eligible projects that fall within eight key areas. These areas build on the significant investments we have previously made and will not be allocated to any google.org activities.\n\nWe are proud of our efforts to make our data centers some of the most efficient in the world. Through optimization of energy, water, and materials, our data centers are now twice as energy efficient as typical enterprise data centers. We have also made great strides in delivering more computing power while using the same amount of electricity.\n\nAddressing climate change requires a transition to a clean energy economy. Google has committed approximately $4 billion to purchase clean energy from over 50 wind and solar projects globally, extending through 2034. Going forward, our vision is to source carbon-free energy for our operations around the clock, matching our energy consumption with clean energy for each of our data centers on an hourly basis.\n\nFrom the beginning, we have focused on the impact of our workplaces and have taken steps to build environmentally-friendly offices and reduce food waste. Over 13 million square feet of Google offices are now LEED certified. We are also actively promoting the use of electric vehicles and bicycles to reduce carbon emissions and have saved over 40,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions by using Google shuttles in the Bay Area. This is equivalent to taking 8,760 cars off the road every workday.\n\nMaximizing the reuse of finite resources is a priority for us. We strive to achieve this across our operations, products, and supply chains. To date, we have shipped millions of devices made with post-consumer recycled plastic, and all Nest products launched in 2019 include recycled plastics.\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, we are committed to being a good neighbor in the places we call home. In response to the affordable housing crisis in the Bay Area, we have pledged $1 billion to invest in housing. Our goal is to help build 20,000 residential units, with at least 5,000 of them being affordable.\n\nCOVID-19 has had a devastating impact on many businesses. To aid in the recovery, we have committed over $800 million to support small- and medium-sized businesses, health organizations, governments, and frontline health workers. We have also partnered with Opportunity Finance Network to provide low-interest loans to community development financial institutions, which in turn provide loans to small businesses in underserved communities across the U.S. Additionally, we are collaborating with the American Library Association to establish entrepreneurship centers nationwide.\n\nAt Google, we believe in using our resources to make a positive difference in the world. We are dedicated to creating innovative solutions and investing in projects that benefit society and the environment. END"}

In fact, it often serves as the primary distribution channel for critical and investigative reporting that exposes wrongdoing, creates awareness, and brings about positive change in society and the economy.\n\nUnfortunately, there are individuals who aim to hinder this important journalism by silencing it when it is most needed. They can easily carry out a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which can completely shut down a website without the owners even realizing they have been targeted. These attacks pose a threat to free expression and access to information, two values that Google holds dear.\n\nTo counteract this issue, we developed Project Shield a few years ago. It uses Google's robust security infrastructure to detect and filter attacks on news and human rights websites. Initially, we tested Project Shield with a select group of trusted individuals, and now we are excited to expand it to all news sites worldwide. Our goal is to protect these sites from DDoS attacks and eliminate DDoS as a form of censorship.\n\nThrough our early testing phase, we not only managed to keep websites online during attacks that would have otherwise taken them offline, but we also gained valuable insights into how these attacks occur and how we can enhance our services to better defend against them.\n\nWith this expansion, tens of thousands of news sites will have access to Project Shield. The best part is that Project Shield is completely free, ensuring even the smallest independent news organizations can continue their vital work without the fear of being forced to shut down.\n\nFurthermore, Project Shield is not solely focused on safeguarding journalism. It also aims to improve the overall health of the internet by mitigating a significant threat faced by publishers and individuals who want to share content that some may find inconvenient. At the core, it is about protecting the free flow of information, starting with news reporting.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how Project Shield works or if you work in journalism and want to join the fight to protect the world's news, please visit our website for more information.

From educators to comedians, to gamers and everything in between, we have witnessed Canadian creators utilize YouTube to build successful digital businesses and enrich Canada's cultural landscape. \n\nToday, Oxford Economics released an exciting report on the economic, societal, and cultural contributions of YouTube in Canada in 2022. The report revealed that YouTube's creative ecosystem contributed over $2.0 billion CAD to Canada's GDP and supported more than 35,000 full-time equivalent jobs. \n\nOne shining example of a Canadian creator who has harnessed the power of YouTube is Cassandra, the mastermind behind the channel Clutterbug. With 780k subscribers and 94 m+ views, Cassandra, a mother of three, struggled with a messy and cluttered home. However, after discovering effective home management methods, she was determined to share her organization tips and tricks. Thanks to a camera gifted by her husband, Cassandra uploaded her first YouTube video a decade ago, hoping to connect with potential customers and explore business opportunities. Today, Cassandra has four best-selling books, a podcast, and her own HGTV show called \"Hot Mess House.\" What she loves most about being a creator is the participatory experience with her community. Viewers constantly reach out to her, expressing how her cleaning philosophy has improved their homes, lives, and even relationships. \n\nCanadian creators not only make a substantial economic impact but also shape society and provide invaluable learning opportunities. Steph & Den, creators of a personal finance education channel with 89k subscribers and 17 m+ views, noticed a lack of representation in the personal finance space. They decided to share their experiences and explore topics such as investing, debt, and money systems on YouTube. As their audience grew, so did their mission to demystify finance for their community. \n\nOne in three Canadian creators who earn money from YouTube consider it their primary source of revenue. Moreover, creators from all walks of life can use YouTube to share their culture with the world, allowing Canadian viewers to learn about different cultures and broaden their perspectives. For instance, Bilal, the creator behind the YouTube channel GoldenGully with 4.06 m+ subscribers and 3b+ views, shares his family recipes and his love for Pakistani food and flavors. As his channel grew, he discovered that viewers from Canada, Germany, Iran, and Mexico found commonalities rather than differences in his content. The comments section is filled with stories from viewers about the similarities they find in Pakistani cuisine and their family recipes. Bilal attributes YouTube's global platform for helping him share his passion with the world. \n\nThe Oxford Economics report solidifies what we've observed across Canada. Canadian creators are making significant impacts and are the current and future generation of CEOs, directors, writers, producers, editors, marketers, and talented individuals. These incredible storytellers, with their diverse backgrounds, continue to thrive on YouTube, shape culture, and have a positive impact on Canada. \n\nTo learn more about Canada's creator economy and meet more of the amazing Canadian creators behind these impressive numbers, visit yt.be\/impact.

Recent research conducted by Oxford Economics reveals that YouTube's creative ecosystem has contributed over $2.0 billion CAD to Canada's GDP in 2022, supporting 35,000 full-time equivalent jobs.\n\nIn a world where there are endless entertainment options available to Canadians, they consistently choose to spend their time on YouTube, indulging in the content created by their favorite creators. This translates to a large and engaged audience, making YouTube the ultimate platform for creators, viewers, and advertisers alike. In fact, according to Comscore, YouTube reaches an impressive 98% of Canadians across all demographics, making it the number one ad-supported video platform in Canada.\n\nFurthermore, Canadians are increasingly enjoying YouTube on their TV screens, particularly with the rise of connected TV (CTV). The living room has become the preferred choice for Canadians to stream YouTube, with over 17 million people doing so in December 2022. For the past five years, CTV has been the fastest-growing platform for YouTube. As this living room revolution continues, we offer solutions that can help advertisers effectively reach their target audiences on the big screen.\n\nWhen it comes to advertising on YouTube, brands can now have the best of both worlds: the impactful reach of TV and the precision and control of digital. YouTube combines the power of reach, relevance, and the world's most connected ad ecosystem to help advertisers achieve better results and maximize the impact of their media spend.\n\nTo make it easier for advertisers to connect with their customers across any screen, we have implemented several strategies:\n\n1. Brands can now reach customers they wouldn't be able to find anywhere else by utilizing solutions like YouTube Select lineups. These lineups include the most popular content watched on TV, such as top creators, live sports, shows, and music.\n\n2. We have expanded our exclusive YouTube Masthead opportunity to offer more ways for brands to capture their audience's attention. For significant moments like new movie releases or product launches, advertisers can now take advantage of the cost-per-hour masthead. This allows them exclusive ownership of the masthead during the hour(s) leading up to, during, or after priority moments.\n\n3. Short-form videos are booming, and YouTube Shorts has become a highly popular platform averaging over 50 billion daily views. Brands can drive performance in their direct-response campaigns by leveraging vertical video ads that seamlessly appear between organic shorts content. These campaigns are powered by artificial intelligence (AI), enabling brands to easily develop the right creative and ensure they reach their desired audience.\n\n4. For YouTube Select on CTV, we have introduced 30-second non-skippable ads. This format aligns with advertisers' objectives and allows for richer storytelling on the big screen. Instead of viewers seeing two consecutive 15-second ads, they will now experience one 30-second ad.\n\n5. We have also prioritized enhancing the user experience for both viewers and advertisers by creating an interactive and seamless cross-screen experience. For viewers watching on the big screen, brand extensions have been implemented, enabling them to learn more about a product with just one click, without interrupting their viewing pleasure.\n\nIn summary, YouTube remains the go-to platform for creators, viewers, and advertisers in Canada. With its wide-reaching audience, diverse content, and innovative advertising solutions, YouTube provides a unique opportunity for brands to effectively connect with their customers across all screens.

That's why we are dedicated to investing in protections, privacy features, and user-friendly content controls that enable families to learn, play, and explore safely online.\n\nToday, we want to remind Canadians about the resources, tips, and safety features available from Google and YouTube that can help families manage their digital experiences and develop smarter and safer online habits. At YouTube, one of our main responsibilities is swiftly removing any content that violates our community guidelines. We achieve this through a combination of advanced machine learning technology and human reviewers. Our policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails. We enforce these policies consistently across languages, perspectives, and speakers.\n\nIn our most recent quarterly report, we disclosed that YouTube removed over 5.6 million videos for violating our community guidelines in the last quarter. More than 94% of these videos were initially flagged by our automated systems, and over 71% were removed before receiving more than 10 views. This report is just one way we aim to provide transparency about how we maintain the safety of our platform and community.\n\nHowever, we understand that Canadians are still seeking advice and support on how to ensure their families' online safety. That's why we offer various tools to manage your digital experience:\n\n1. YouTube Kids: We developed YouTube Kids as a safer space for children under the age of 13 to explore their interests and curiosity. It includes extensive filters for age-appropriate content, as well as parental controls and settings that allow customization of the experience. Parents can set bedtime reminders, monitor screen time, and adjust autoplay or search functions. You can even set an in-app timer to limit your child's screen time. It's important to regularly review and update your family settings to meet your evolving needs.\n\n2. YouTube Supervised Accounts: This feature on YouTube is designed to cater to families with tweens and teens who have their own devices or want their own accounts. Parents and caregivers have access to parental options and controls to determine the online experience that suits their family best. We have expanded support for supervised accounts, allowing tweens to sign in to YouTube on various devices, such as gaming consoles, smart TVs, and the YouTube Music app. This ensures that a parent's content settings are respected across all devices where their tween accesses videos or music.\n\n3. Google Search: Users can enable SafeSearch on Google, which helps filter out explicit content. In the coming months, we will introduce a new function that automatically blurs out explicit search results for all users above 18 years old and signed out.\n\n4. Family Link: The parental tools' app, Family Link, assists parents in cultivating healthy digital habits in their children. It provides visibility into a child's device usage, allowing parents to monitor screen time, set device bedtime, and implement content restrictions.\n\nWe also recognize the importance of protecting your family's personal information and online activity. Safeguarding your online privacy is a top priority for us. We build our products with built-in protections and have dedicated global teams and operations to prevent abuse on our platforms.

My name is Sabrina Geremia, and I am the Vice President and Head of Google in Canada. Today, I am joined by Jason Kee, an expert on search, news, and ads. We are here to answer your questions about our approach to bill C-18 and our news product tests. \n\nGoogle has been proudly present in Canada for over 20 years, with offices in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, and Waterloo, which is a Canadian center of engineering excellence. We also have remote colleagues all across the country. We truly consider these Canadian communities as our own, which is why we have made significant investments in them over the years. \n\nAt Google, we work closely with the news industry. Through various programs, products, and partnerships, we are one of the world's largest financial supporters of journalism. We provide significant value and funding to news organizations in Canada and around the globe. Just last year, we linked to Canadian news publishers over 3.6 billion times, completely free of charge. This helped them generate revenue through ads and new subscriptions, resulting in an estimated value of $250 million for Canadian publishers. Additionally, we have paid agreements with more than 150 publications across the country, in both official languages, including Le Devoir, CN2i, Torstar, The Globe and Mail, Black Press Media, Métro Média, Postmedia, Village Media, and many others. These agreements support Canadian newsrooms of all sizes, enabling them to deliver comprehensive general-interest and local news to their communities. \n\nWe understand that innovation is crucial to the future of news. That's why through the Google News Initiative, we provide tools, training, and funding to support Canadian news organizations, independent journalists, and journalism students. We are committed to helping them adapt, innovate, and thrive. In fact, we have made a three-year commitment to train 5,000 Canadian journalists and journalism students on strengthening digital skills in newsrooms. Last year alone, we trained over 1,500 Canadian journalists from different newsrooms, including students, independent journalists, and those serving underrepresented communities. \n\nWe share the government's goal of promoting a healthy, innovative, and diverse news ecosystem in the digital age. Throughout the process of bill C-18, we have been constructive and transparent about our concerns. We have actively worked with parliamentarians to improve the bill and offered reasonable and balanced solutions. Unfortunately, the bill has some serious issues. The provision in C-18 that puts a price on linking to webpages sets a dangerous precedent. It threatens the open web and the free flow of information. Moreover, it could incentivize the creation of low-quality clickbait content instead of supporting quality journalism. The exemption and eligibility criteria in the bill have also significantly shifted, requiring subsidies for media companies even if they do not produce news, are not online, and regardless of whether we link to their content. The lack of a clearly defined commitment to a code of ethics for eligibility also compromises the standards of journalism in Canada. Unreasonable timelines and unfair arbitration provisions have been added as well, creating a framework that discourages good faith negotiations. Instead of supporting local journalism, C-18 would end up subsidizing large legacy organizations and broadcasters, hurting emerging and innovative organizations that provide quality local news in communities all across Canada. It is clear that this bill is no longer about supporting journalism. \n\nUnder C-18, platforms like Google would be held financially liable for providing free links to news that Canadians are searching for, with no cap on the financial burden. This raises concerns about how Canadians will find and share news online. As the bill has progressed, we have had to consider potential changes to our products to comply with it. These changes would need to be tested before implementation. END"}

In fact, our 2022 Kantar Think Auto research shows that 8 out of 10 Canadians rely on online search when buying a car to make informed decisions. And it's not just about finding information online - people are actually making purchases there too. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online car sales increased by a staggering 600%, with 6% of Canadian shoppers buying a vehicle completely online. \n\nToday's shoppers expect a convenient and helpful experience when they search for a new car. This is why it's crucial for auto advertisers to provide the right information and inventory to connect with potential buyers. That's why we're introducing vehicle ads - a new ad format that showcases cars for sale in Canada. \n\nWith vehicle ads, you can easily reach customers who are in the market for a new ride. For example, if someone searches for a 2023 SUV, they will see a variety of vehicle options available for purchase nearby or with delivery. The ad will include pictures and important inventory details such as location, make, model, price, and mileage. When a customer selects a car, they will be directed to your website's vehicle description page, where they can fill out a lead form or find your dealership's contact information. You also have the ability to track and measure the actions that matter to you, such as leads and store visits, and assign a value to them. \n\nTo get started, all you need to do is create a vehicle inventory data feed and connect it to Google Merchant Center. This feed will contain all the necessary details about your vehicle inventory, including make, model, price, mileage, and condition. Google uses this information to match shoppers with the most relevant cars as they search. Plus, you'll have access to key inventory and ad performance insights.\n\nDuring beta testing, advertisers who supplemented their existing search campaigns with vehicle ads saw an average increase in conversions of 25%. Let's take a closer look at a couple of businesses that recently tried out vehicle ads.\n\nHamel Honda wanted to find a new way to reach customers at the right time with the right vehicle inventory. With the help of 360 Agencies and the Google team, they implemented a vehicle ads campaign to showcase their used inventory in real time. By incorporating vehicle ads alongside their search campaigns, they experienced a 27% increase in leads for used vehicles, reduced the cost per acquisition by 18%, and saw a 17% increase in conversion rate.\n\nAsbury Automotive Group needed a solution to meet the demand of online car shoppers. They created a vehicle feed that listed all their inventory with descriptive attributes like make and model, as well as the locations of their dealerships. By using vehicle ads to promote their used car inventory in search results, Asbury saw a 35% increase in conversions and a 12% increase in conversion value.\n\nIn conclusion, vehicle ads provide a powerful tool for reaching customers who are actively searching for a new car. By utilizing this ad format, you can showcase your inventory, engage with potential buyers, and ultimately drive more conversions. END"}

In recent weeks, the world has been confronted with violent and racist attacks against the black community, which has shed light on the deeply ingrained structural and systemic racism that black people have endured for generations. I personally embarked on a journey to find answers within our own organization. By listening to the personal stories shared by members of our black leadership advisory group and our black+ googlers, I have been even more convinced of the harsh reality faced by black communities. Systemic racism has seeped into every aspect of their lives, from encounters with law enforcement to access to housing, finance, healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAs a company, and as individuals who came together to create products that benefit everyone, Google is fully committed to transforming the energy of this moment into lasting and impactful change. Today, we are proud to announce a series of concrete commitments that will drive progress both internally and externally. We aim to build sustainable equity for Google's black+ community and ensure our products and programs are genuinely helpful during the critical moments that matter to black users.\n\nDeveloping sustainable equity and bringing about meaningful change must begin within our own company. By strengthening our dedication to racial equity and inclusion, Google will be able to create even more helpful products for our users and the world. To achieve this, we are making several commitments to promote sustainable equity within our black+ community.\n\nFirstly, we will work towards increasing black+ representation at senior levels and set a goal to improve leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30 percent by 2025. To achieve this objective, we will advertise senior leadership positions externally as well as internally, and invest more in cities such as Atlanta, Washington D.C., Chicago, and London, where we already have offices. We will adopt a similar approach in other regions, using location-specific strategies to recruit and hire more underrepresented googlers in communities that already foster a sense of belonging and contribute to an improved quality of life.\n\nSecondly, we will address representation challenges more comprehensively, with a focus on hiring, retention, and promotion at all levels. To guide these efforts, I will establish a talent liaison within each product and functional area, responsible for mentoring and advocating for the progression and retention of underrepresented googlers. Additionally, I am assembling a task force comprising senior members of our black+ community at Google. Their mission will be to develop concrete recommendations and proposals to ensure accountability across all areas that impact the experience of black+ googlers, including recruitment, hiring, performance management, career progression, and retention. I have requested that the task force present their specific proposals, including measurable goals, within 90 days.\n\nThirdly, we will strive to create a stronger sense of inclusion and belonging for all googlers, with a particular focus on our black+ community. Our internal research has shown that feelings of belonging are influenced by various aspects of our work experience, including the psychological safety we feel within our teams, the support provided by our managers and leaders, fair people processes, and opportunities for personal and professional growth. In all these dimensions, we are committed to building more inclusive practices and policies, and we will be open to revisiting and refining them when necessary. For instance, we have recently realized that our security practice of googlers monitoring for unauthorized visitors, known as \"tailgaters,\" can be susceptible to bias. Over the past year, our global security and resilience team, in collaboration with a cross-functional working group, conducted extensive research and listened to the experiences of black googlers. Together, they developed and tested new security procedures to ensure the safety and security of the Google community without relying on this type of enforcement. As we prepare to return to the office, we will no longer require googlers to check each other's badges and will instead rely on our already robust security infrastructure.\n\nThese commitments demonstrate Google's unwavering dedication to creating a more equitable and inclusive environment. We recognize that there is still work to be done, and we are committed to making the necessary changes to better support our black+ community and all of our googlers. We believe that by implementing these actions, we can create a more just and inclusive society that benefits everyone. END"}

However, millions of gallons of water are wasted every year due to leaky toilets, a common but easily preventable cause. That's why we recently partnered with other organizations to fund a pilot project in Los Angeles. The project aims to install water-saving technology in three multifamily buildings, specifically targeting common leaks like toilets that continue to run water when not in use. These small leaks can really add up over time.\n\nOur pilot project is making great progress and is on track to save 6.4 million gallons of water per year in the Los Angeles watershed, where we operate. This supports our commitment to replenish 120% of the water we consume across our offices and data centers by 2030. We are proud to be working with partners from the California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC), a network of over 25 organizations, including private companies like Google, as well as environmental NGOs and nonprofits. Together, we are dedicated to improving water security across the state.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how this project is making a difference. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power estimates that the average household loses up to 10,000 gallons of water each year due to unnoticed leaks in toilets. The good news is that although these leaks can be difficult to detect, they are actually quite easy to fix.\n\nFor our pilot project, CWAC members Pacific Institute and Bonneville Environmental Foundation tackled this challenge in three low-income multifamily housing buildings operated by nonprofit organizations. They worked alongside the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and other local water utilities. Toilets in these buildings were equipped with small, low-cost, low-power sensors developed by Sensor Industries. When a toilet leaks, the sensors immediately alert building management, who can then arrange for repairs. Usually, the fix is as simple as readjusting or replacing the toilet flapper.\n\nThis simple intervention has led to significant savings in water, money, and energy, as estimated by the Pacific Institute. First, the pilot is reducing building water use by an estimated 15% to 25%. The expected savings of 6.4 million gallons of water per year is equivalent to the total annual water use of about 40 single-family homes. These savings also benefit other customers who rely on the same public utility, as it reduces overall water demand and improves water reliability and affordability across the system.\n\nSecond, the water savings also translate into cost savings on water and wastewater bills of 15% to 25%. This amounts to tens of thousands of dollars saved each year, which the nonprofit building operators can use to make necessary improvements. Essentially, they can pass these savings along to the residents.\n\nLastly, by reducing the demand for water that is imported from distant sources, the project also helps to cut back on energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In Southern California, it requires a significant amount of energy to pump water over the mountains surrounding the L.A. basin and treat it for household use. Therefore, by reducing the demand for this water, we are also reducing energy consumption.\n\nIn addition to these savings, there are other advantages to this approach. Residents don't have to do anything as the non-invasive system detects problems and notifies the building management. Facility managers can quickly identify the cause of the leak, such as a stuck flapper, which helps them fix it faster. This means less time wasted on tracking down leaks and more time focused on addressing more urgent issues.\n\nOverall, this pilot project is making a significant impact in saving water, money, and energy. It highlights the potential for collective action models to address the rising water challenges we face. By working together with various organizations and utilizing innovative technology, we can make a real difference in water conservation and create a more sustainable future. END"}

However, it can also come with a long list of tasks to complete before that first day. Teachers have the important responsibility of creating a positive learning environment, stocking their classrooms, and preparing lessons. At the same time, institutions and procurement teams face the challenge of managing budgets and approving purchases for faculty and staff. There is a lot that goes into ensuring a smooth first day for students.\n\nWhether you work in early childhood, K-12, or higher education, Amazon Business is here to simplify the buying process for both educators and administrators. We understand the unique needs of the education sector and have created special savings opportunities and software solutions with you in mind. Let us show you how you can drive value, boost buyer compliance, and ensure your educators get what they need just in time for the new school year.\n\nOne way we empower educators is by allowing them to get what they need while ensuring purchases are compliant. Amazon Business account administrators have the ability to define different types of buying policies. This means you can identify preferred products or sellers, support local businesses, buy from minority-owned entities, and promote sustainability initiatives. Additionally, administrators can block restricted sellers or categories and set spending limits for teachers, faculty, and staff using buying policies and approvals. With this feature, when an educator needs to make a purchase that requires approval, the process automatically kicks in, saving time for both procurement teams and buyers. Only necessary purchases identified in the policy are escalated, freeing up time for you and approvers to focus on more important tasks.\n\nSchool funding is often distributed on a first-come-first-serve basis, which leads to educators rushing to make requests at the beginning of the school year out of fear of losing funds. To alleviate this pressure, Amazon Business offers a budget management tool that helps account administrators allocate time-bound funds to educators. This tool allows educators to know their balance and when they need to spend it.\n\nBuilding a positive learning environment is crucial for any successful classroom. It's never too early to start buying materials for specific lesson plans, or at the very least, restocking basic supplies that educators and students will need daily. To make buying from Amazon Business even more convenient, we've created a dedicated back-to-school storefront. This storefront offers staff and teachers special pricing on a wide selection of products they need to kick off the year. You can find low prices and curated supplies categorized by age group, as well as view popular products purchased by other educators. Our storefront includes books, everyday school supplies, electronics, classroom organization and furniture, educational activities and STEM resources, sanitation and wellness products, and much more.\n\nIf you need to buy in higher quantities, we've got you covered with quantity discounts. Educators can enjoy savings when they purchase at least two of the same item at the same time. Additionally, for high volume purchases that exceed $10,000 or involve over 999 units, our custom quote feature allows buyers to request a discounted price. Sellers can then reply with an offer, and buyers can decide whether to place their order.\n\nTo keep your classroom stocked year-round, we recommend using business lists. These lists allow educators to easily replenish commonly purchased items such as paper, pens, post-it notes, and dry-erase markers. By creating a catalog of repeat items, business lists streamline the buying process and save time searching for and purchasing supplies. Each buyer can create their own unique list that suits their needs and even share their lists with other buyers.\n\nWith Amazon Business, we are committed to making the buying process as simple and convenient as possible for educators and administrators. We understand the importance of a smooth first day and are here to support you every step of the way. END"}

It's the dedication of our Spotifiers and the work they do every day that makes Spotify such an amazing place to work. We prioritize creating a space where everyone can come together, connect, and celebrate. We want our audience to feel completely free to immerse themselves in the experience we've created, while also fostering moments of connection and community. These special moments become lasting memories for our Spotify family. This year, we have another achievement to celebrate. At our flagship event in Stockholm, we placed a strong focus on sustainability and proudly received the greentime sustainable event certification. Demonstrating our commitment to sustainability in our employer branding is a powerful way of connecting our employees' personal values with our company's cultural values. Many employees seek confirmation that they've joined a company that takes its responsibilities seriously and follows through on its promises. A company's sustainability strategy and actions are major factors when deciding to join or stay with an employer. Spotify is dedicated to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and we're reviewing all aspects of our business, including our community events. During the production of Spotifest Stockholm, we followed greentime's planning tool and focused on making improvements that had the greatest impact. We made changes to our event production and at the event itself, reducing our carbon emissions and promoting social change. Here are the specific areas we focused on for sustainable event production: \n1. Location & Venue: We selected a location with existing event infrastructure, such as electricity, water, Wi-Fi, and restrooms. This decision had a significant ecological, economic, and social impact, as it eliminated the need to build everything from scratch on a field.\n2. Travel & Transports: The event site we chose was easily accessible by public transportation, reducing CO2 emissions and saving time and money for our Spotifiers. Additionally, by selecting a venue and location close to local restaurants, we minimized the need for transport for catering services.\n3. Food, Beverage & Packaging: To lower CO2 emissions, over half of the food served was vegetarian\/vegan and sourced from local restaurant partners. We prioritize local, organic, and fair trade food. In line with our Substance Awareness & Support program, we centered the event around creativity and inspiration, offering a variety of non-alcoholic beverages. All food and beverages were served in reusable or recyclable, non-plastic packaging.\n4. Safety & Security: Ensuring the safety and security of our employees, suppliers, and performers is of utmost importance to us as a socially sustainable employer. We implemented an extensive security plan for the event, conducting meetings and on-site visits to ensure appropriate fencing, guards, emergency exits, and first aid measures were in place. We partnered with the most experienced security company in the industry to guarantee the safety of all guests and staff during the event. END"}

Many companies are taking a more mindful approach to their spending and making cuts to non-essential perks for employees. While this may be tough, it is often necessary to ensure the overall health of the business. These situations truly test our values as organizations. It's easy to claim to prioritize people when times are good, but if our values don't genuinely support a human-centered approach to running a business, it becomes obvious.\n\nRight now, we all need to be more mindful of where we allocate our finances. We can no longer indulge in unnecessary expenses, but instead, we should prioritize the essential basics. While sugar may add a temporary spark, it ultimately provides empty calories. It may give us a quick rush, but it won't sustain us in the long run. As HR professionals, we should avoid these short-term rushes as they do not deliver significant or lasting benefits. Instead, we should focus on building a strong foundation and cultural fabric that will help us weather any storms.\n\nIt's important to recognize that not everything sweet is sugar. Just like protein, which builds stronger muscles, sweetness can also come from building a robust cultural fabric. This is crucial to stay resilient during challenging times. As a Community Experience team at Spotify, some may assume that what we do is just an indulgence. However, we disagree. Elevating the employee experience in this way is not empty calories. In fact, we argue that HR professionals who understand the importance of flexibility and belonging know that now is the perfect time to invest in creating a sense of belonging through community.\n\nInvesting in employee experience and creating a strong sense of belonging has multiple benefits. It not only helps employees feel valued and connected, but it also improves retention rates. By building a firm foundation, we ensure that our house remains standing strong even when faced with adversity. Furthermore, looking to the future, when the economic landscape stabilizes, we won't have to start from scratch. Our strong foundation will give us a competitive advantage both during and after challenging times.\n\nAt Spotify, our Community Experience team, known as CommunityX, strives to foster connections among our employees. We create physical and virtual spaces where people can connect and align their efforts towards a common goal. These connections make our talent and business more efficient. Since implementing our work from anywhere policy, we have actively worked on tools and initiatives to build connectivity. We have seen great results through virtual meetings and collaboration. Additionally, our internal talent marketplace, Echo, has helped broaden our employees' networks and enhance their skills.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that these initiatives alone are not enough. While meeting your immediate team is important for building connections, it can also lead to working in silos. There must be multiple opportunities and avenues for people to form connections. By building a robust web of connections, we strengthen the fabric of our culture, ensuring its endurance even during challenging times or potential storms.\n\nBy creating meaningful moments that matter, we can create lasting memories of fun and togetherness. These memories will help us navigate through times of physical distance and remote work. END"}

CEO Doug McMillon had the pleasure of attending the grand opening of a state-of-the-art green hydrogen plant at Walmart's Quilicura distribution center in Santiago, Chile. This exciting project exemplifies our ongoing dedication to renewable energy and marks a significant step forward for Walmart Chile in achieving our goal of net-zero emissions.\n\nThis groundbreaking plant, developed in collaboration with Engie, is the first of its kind in Latin America. It's a testament to our commitment to sustainability and will play a crucial role in our journey towards becoming a regenerative and zero-emission company by 2040. We were honored to have esteemed guests like Walmart Chile CEO Cristián Barrientos, Chile Minister of Finance Mario Marcel, Chile Minister of Energy Diego Pardow, and Engie Chile Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Pablo Villarino join us for this momentous occasion.\n\nWe see tremendous potential in this green hydrogen technology and are eager to expand its use across all our distribution centers throughout the country. Our aim is for our logistics network to operate 100% with green hydrogen by 2025. We're already exploring its application in transportation and emergency services, where we have ongoing pilot programs.\n\nIn its initial stage, the green hydrogen plant will enable the Quilicura distribution center to replace the lead-acid batteries of 200 forklift cranes with hydrogen energy cells. This switch will eliminate 250 tons of toxic waste annually. Over the course of the 15-year project, we expect it to reduce CO2 emissions by 17,100 tons, equivalent to planting 34,200 trees.\n\nOur journey with hydrogen fuel began back in 2012 when we introduced a fleet of 50 vehicles and forklifts in the U.S. Since then, we've grown that number to over 9,500 forklifts. With over a decade of experience and progress, we're excited to invest in Chile's potential as a producer of clean energy and green hydrogen. The Chilean government's focus on renewable energy has resulted in significant growth in solar and wind power sectors, with up to 70% of their electrical grid projected to be renewable-powered by 2030. This presents a fantastic opportunity for Chile to develop a thriving green hydrogen industry powered by low-cost renewable resources and foster a sustainable economy.\n\nWalmart has made substantial strides towards our climate goals by incorporating renewable sources through self-generation and the purchase of certified renewable energy. Currently, 84% of Walmart Chile's consumption comes from clean energy sources, and our 390+ facilities are well on track to achieve 100% renewable energy use even before our global commitment deadline of 2035. We are determined to become a regenerative company, one that leaves the world better than we found it.\n\nThe energy transition our world needs may be challenging, but by working together, we can achieve it.

This small change can make a big difference in reducing the amount of plastic bags in circulation.\n\nTo further reduce waste, we're implementing right-sized packaging technology in half of our fulfillment network. This means that your packages will be custom-fitted to your order, reducing the need for filler and oversized boxes. Not only does this help the environment, but it also creates a better unboxing experience for you.\n\nAdditionally, we're introducing the option for customers to consolidate multiple items into fewer boxes. This not only reduces waste but also cuts down on the number of shipments, making the process more efficient and sustainable.\n\nOur commitment to sustainability goes beyond packaging. We're using AI technology to fulfill online orders from our stores instead of our fulfillment centers whenever possible. This reduces the number of miles driven and boxes used for shipping. We're also using electric vans to deliver orders, combining multiple orders on single routes to further reduce emissions.\n\nThese changes are just the beginning of our journey to becoming a more sustainable company. We're investing in the right omnichannel capabilities to meet your needs while minimizing our impact on the environment. We believe that by placing people and the planet at the center of our growth, we can create a positive difference in the world.\n\nThank you for joining us on this journey towards a more sustainable future.

During this stage of the decision-making process, the members of the Governing Council discussed various factors and recommendations provided by the staff. The meetings began on July 5, with Governor Tiff Macklem leading the discussions. The attendees included Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers, Deputy Governors Paul Beaudry, Toni Gravelle, Sharon Kozicki, and Nicolas Vincent.\n\nThe discussion started with an assessment of recent global economic developments. Overall, the global economy performed better than expected earlier in the year. Although growth had slowed down, consumer and business spending remained resilient, especially in the United States. Inflation rates decreased in most advanced economies due to lower oil prices and reduced inflation in goods. The Governing Council noted a few common themes across advanced economies:\n\n1. Core inflation remained stubborn due to strong consumer demand, tight labor markets, and high inflation expectations.\n2. Supply bottlenecks improved, and manufacturing slowed down as demand for goods weakened, but there was still strong demand for services.\n3. Despite significant monetary policy tightening, underlying inflation pressures persisted, leading major central banks to signal the need for further tightening to address inflation.\n\nThe members discussed the stronger-than-expected economic activity in the United States, primarily driven by robust consumer spending. The strong job market led to increased income growth for US households, who also drew down their savings. On the other hand, growth in the euro area stalled in the first half of 2023 due to weak consumer demand for goods and tighter monetary policy. However, the services sector remained robust, partly due to pent-up demand.\n\nChina's economy was projected to slow down more than anticipated after a strong rebound following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. Slower global growth negatively impacted manufacturing and exports, while the Chinese property sector remained weak. This slowdown in China also affected oil prices and demand for non-energy commodities.\n\nThe Governing Council observed a decline in oil prices since the last projection. However, if global supply fails to keep up with demand in the future, prices could rise again. The voluntary production cuts by OPEC members and some non-OPEC oil producers aimed at limiting global supply might counterbalance any softness in demand resulting from slower global growth and China's slowdown.\n\nThe council agreed that the risk of global banking strains had diminished but was still present. Yields on government bonds in Europe and North America had increased, while overall equity prices had been stronger since June.\n\nAs for the Canadian economy, the council members reviewed the evidence and discussions from their previous decision in June. They focused on the dynamics of consumer spending and inflation. They concluded that the strength in consumer spending in the first quarter of 2023 could be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Tight labor markets and solid income growth were supporting spending.\n2. Canadians had accumulated additional savings during the pandemic, providing a buffer for higher prices and interest rates.\n3. Strong population growth in the first quarter contributed to increased consumption.\n4. Pent-up demand, especially for services, continued to drive consumption as Canadians caught up on activities they couldn't participate in during the pandemic. END"}

I'm excited to be here today with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss some important updates. We have made the decision to raise our policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%. Additionally, we will continue implementing our policy of quantitative tightening.\n\nThis decision is based on two important factors. Firstly, our monetary policy has been effective in combating inflation, but we are still facing some persistent inflationary pressures. While we have made significant progress in reducing consumer price index (CPI) inflation from its peak of 8.1% last summer to 3.4% in May, the underlying inflationary pressures have proven to be more stubborn than anticipated. Therefore, it is necessary to raise interest rates to slow down the growth of demand in the economy and relieve price pressures.\n\nSecondly, we are carefully balancing the risks associated with tightening or loosening monetary policy. If we don't take sufficient action now, we may have to take more drastic measures later. On the other hand, if we tighten too much, it could unnecessarily burden everyone with difficult economic conditions. We have made significant progress thus far, and it is crucial that we continue on this path to restore price stability for Canadians.\n\nLet me provide some further insight into our considerations and highlight a few key points from the governing council's discussions. Global economic growth has exceeded our expectations since the beginning of the year, mainly due to lower energy prices and smaller price increases for goods. However, we are still experiencing inflationary pressures in the services sector, driven by strong demand and tight labor markets. The bank predicts that global economic growth will be stronger this year compared to our initial projections in January and April. A similar trend is observed in Canada, where the economy has shown surprising strength and remains in a state of excess demand. Consumer spending on services continues to be robust, and while spending on goods sensitive to interest rates has slowed, it hasn't slowed down as much as we anticipated. The housing market has also seen an increase in activity.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this solid household spending. The labor market remains tight, with a historically low unemployment rate and wage growth between 4% and 5%, which is higher than what is consistent with price stability. Moreover, many households have been able to save during the COVID-19 pandemic, acting as a buffer and supporting consumer spending. It is worth noting that rapid population growth contributes to both supply and demand in the economy. Newcomers entering the labor force alleviate the labor shortage, but they also contribute to consumer spending and housing demand.\n\nRegarding inflation, while CPI inflation has decreased relatively quickly, a large part of this decline can be attributed to lower energy prices and base-year effects as the significant price increases experienced last year are no longer factored into annual inflation. However, we continue to observe substantial price increases across a wide range of goods and services. Our measures of core inflation, which help us gauge underlying inflationary pressures, have decreased but not as much as we expected. Core inflation rates have remained around 3.5% to 4% since September, indicating limited downward momentum. Although consumer and business expectations for near-term inflation are moderating, they still remain high. Businesses are also reporting more frequent price increases compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOverall, we are taking necessary steps to address inflationary pressures and maintain stability in the economy. By carefully managing monetary policy and considering various factors, we aim to create a favorable environment for both consumers and businesses. END"}

During this stage of the decision-making process, the Council reviewed all staff briefings and recommendations. The policy decision-making meetings began on January 18, with Governor Tiff Macklem presiding over the meetings. Other members in attendance included Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers, Deputy Governor Paul Beaudry, Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle, and Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki.\n\nThe Council started by discussing recent international developments. They noted significant declines in global energy prices and ongoing improvements in global supply chains. They also discussed the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in China. Overall, global economic activity, especially in the United States, the Euro area, and China, was slightly better than expected based on the October Monetary Policy Report.\n\nCouncil members anticipated a slowdown in global growth for 2023 as pent-up demand subsides and higher interest rates begin to impact economic activity. Inflation, while still high, had started to decrease in many countries. The Council engaged in a detailed conversation about how market narratives regarding the global economy and inflation were shifting.\n\nThe Council reviewed the revised outlook for the United States. They observed that US consumers remained resilient, but growth was expected to be relatively flat in 2023. The labor market remained tight, and inflation was coming down due to lower energy prices. Signs of broader moderation in inflation were also becoming apparent. However, the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations posed a risk of financial volatility if an agreement could not be reached.\n\nRegarding the Euro area, the Council saw signs of a mild recession, despite some unexpected resilience thus far. Uncertainty related to the Russian war in Ukraine continued to impact the region, and higher interest rates were affecting economic growth.\n\nThe Council devoted significant time to discussing the situation in China. They considered China's rapid shift in approach to COVID-19 as a new source of uncertainty. They also noted that there was an upside risk to oil prices if Chinese demand rebounded more than expected, which could put renewed pressure on Canadian and global inflation.\n\nThe Council reviewed financial conditions and observed that despite continued tightening by central banks, conditions had eased somewhat since October. This was likely due to a decline in risk premiums across various asset classes, driven by a decrease in headline inflation and a reduced perception of a deep recession. The Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate had remained fairly stable at around 74 cents.\n\nThe Council then turned to domestic economic developments in Canada and the outlook for inflation. They reviewed recent data, survey inputs, staff analysis, and projections. Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 2.9% in the third quarter, surpassing the Bank's expectations. While household spending had softened, strength in commodity exports offset the decline. Data suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter would also be higher than previously projected. Despite the slowdown, there was more excess demand in the economy than anticipated.\n\nThe labor market continued to show tightness, with the December labor force survey reporting unexpectedly strong job gains. This, along with other indicators, indicated persistent tightness in the labor market, a sign of excess demand in the economy. The Council concluded that wage growth was plateauing within the range of 4% to 5%. However, they noted that sustained wage growth within this range would not align with achieving the 2% inflation target unless productivity increased significantly above historical trends. END"}

Macklem acknowledged that higher interest rates can be tough for Canadians, but emphasized that they are necessary to combat the potentially worse consequences of persistently high inflation. The Bank of Canada occasionally holds meetings outside of Ottawa to connect with different communities and understand their concerns. During the lunch, Macklem delivered a brief speech and engaged in a fireside chat with Carolyn Rogers, the Senior Deputy Governor, where they discussed various topics including the bank's response to the pandemic, confidence in Canadian and U.S. banks, and the future of digital currency.\n\nMacklem acknowledged that inflation in Canada has reached levels not seen in almost four decades. Although inflation is decreasing, it still remains too high. Macklem addressed the recent decision to raise the policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point, noting that it is the most rapid increase in interest rates in the country's history. However, he also emphasized that the impact of these rate increases takes time to ripple through the economy. The bank had taken a pause in January to assess whether the previous interest rate hikes had been effective in curbing inflation, but recent indicators suggest that the economy is still overheated. While headline inflation is decreasing, underlying inflation, which excludes volatile factors like food and energy prices, remains stubbornly high. Macklem expressed concern that the decline in inflation might stall, leading to the decision to raise interest rates once again. He remains optimistic that inflation will come down to around three percent this summer.\n\nUnlike inflation, the Bank of Canada does not have a specific target rate for unemployment. However, Macklem explained that a well-balanced labor market is important in achieving their inflation target. When the labor market is tight and companies struggle to find workers, shortages occur, causing prices to rise and fueling inflation. Therefore, a reasonably healthy labor market is typically associated with inflation being close to the target rate.\n\nDuring the interview, Macklem shared his observations about the local economy. He recognized the attractiveness of the central Okanagan region, with its influx of people from other parts of the country and the presence of a university campus that draws young individuals. While traditional industries like agriculture, forestry, mining, and manufacturing continue to be strong, Macklem highlighted the growing importance of the tech sector. Despite the positive developments and numerous opportunities, the area, like the rest of the country, faces challenges with labor shortages. Affordable housing is also a concern in Kelowna, but Macklem emphasized that this issue is not unique to the area. While the Bank of Canada considers the housing market in their monetary policy decisions, their main focus is on inflation when determining interest rates. END"}

A recent comic by Luke McGarry illustrates this idea with a man navigating a daunting post-apocalyptic landscape, pleading for safe passage. The gatekeepers respond by emphasizing the value of homemade sourdough bread as the currency of the future. This comic reflects a current trend: a surge in people baking bread. Google searches for terms like \"bread\" and \"baking bread\" have reached a 14-year peak. It seems like everyone knows someone who has become a bread enthusiast during this pandemic, or maybe you are one yourself. \n\nBut why has breadmaking become such a popular pursuit? One explanation is that making bread can have a deeply healing effect on our wellbeing. Stephen S. Jones, director of Washington State University's Bread Lab, has received heartfelt letters from individuals who turned to breadmaking as a way to cope with grief. He believes that breadmaking is a spiritually enriching experience, where one becomes connected to the living nature of the bread itself.\n\nWhen we think about reducing anxiety and improving our overall mental state, practices like yoga and meditation often come to mind. However, another option is to engage in daily creative activities. You can choose to bake bread, revive an old hobby, or explore a new creative endeavor altogether. Your daily creative task might involve writing a poem, sketching a picture, folding origami, or any other activity that sparks your creativity. \n\nThe healing power of a creative outlet is evident in stories shared by individuals who have turned to daily creative practices during difficult times. For example, one person turned to making a song every day to cope with the emotional weight of losing a loved one and the joy of welcoming a child into the world. Inspired by this experience, he created Futureland, a platform for people to document their daily creative progress. \n\nSimilarly, after the 9\/11 attacks, designer Michael Bierut started drawing something every day as a means of coping. This practice led him to initiate the 100-Day Project with his students at Yale. The project has since grown online, with participants sharing over 1.4 million Instagram posts and counting. \n\nThe goal of engaging in daily creative activities during difficult times is not necessarily to be productive or achieve specific outcomes. It is about tapping into your creativity to find meaning in the situation or to provide an outlet for your energy, which can help maintain a calm and positive attitude. Your daily creative practice can be as short as 20 to 60 seconds. The key is to choose something you can do consistently. \n\nFor instance, one of Bierut's students challenged himself to design a poster in under 60 seconds every day. Another person set a goal to write a single line of code within 20 seconds. And there are remarkable examples like artist Mike Winkelmann, who has drawn something every day for almost 5,000 consecutive days, including the day his daughter was born. \n\nIf you're interested in starting a daily creative practice but unsure where to begin, here's some advice: you don't have to commit to 100 days, even 10 days will suffice. Similar to how we push ourselves to exercise during this pandemic, you will appreciate the effort you put into your creative practice.

During this stage of the decision-making process, council members reviewed staff briefings and recommendations. The meetings, presided over by Governor Tiff Macklem, began on January 18 and included Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers, Deputy Governor Paul Beaudry, Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle, and Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki.\n\nThe discussion started with an overview of recent international developments. Some highlights included the significant decline in global energy prices, the ongoing easing of global supply chain bottlenecks, and the sudden lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in China. Overall, global economic activity, particularly in the United States, the Euro area, and China, exceeded the bank's expectations from the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). However, council members still anticipated a significant slowdown in global growth in 2023 as pent-up demand diminishes, and higher interest rates restrain activity. While inflation remained high and widespread, it had decreased from its peak in many countries. Council members also acknowledged a shift in market narratives regarding the global economy and inflation.\n\nThe council assessed the revised outlook for the United States and noted that while US consumers had shown resilience, growth was expected to be relatively flat in 2023. The labor market remained tight, and inflation was decreasing, mainly due to lower energy prices. Signs of broader moderation in inflation were also becoming apparent. However, the impending debt ceiling negotiations posed risks of financial volatility if an agreement could not be reached. The council continued to see the Euro area heading towards a mild recession, despite its surprising resilience thus far. Risks related to the Russian war in Ukraine contributed to uncertainty, and higher interest rates were affecting growth.\n\nConsiderable time was spent discussing the situation in China, particularly the sudden shift in their approach to COVID-19, which added a new source of uncertainty. The outlook for oil prices was identified as an upside risk due to China's reopening. If Chinese demand rebounded more than anticipated, oil prices could rise substantially, putting renewed upward pressure on Canadian and global inflation.\n\nThe council also reviewed financial conditions and observed that despite ongoing policy tightening by central banks, conditions had eased somewhat since October. This was attributed to a decline in risk premiums across various asset classes, as headline inflation had decreased and the perceived risk of a severe recession had diminished. The Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate remained relatively stable at around 74 cents.\n\nWhen considering Canadian economic developments, the council examined recent domestic data, survey inputs, staff analysis, and projections. Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 2.9% in the third quarter, surpassing the bank's expectations. Although household spending and housing activity were softer, the strength from commodity exports offset these declines. Furthermore, the data suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter would likely be higher than previously projected, indicating more excess demand in the economy than anticipated. The labor market continued to show tightness, with the December Labor Force Survey reporting unexpectedly strong job gains. This, along with other indicators, indicated that the tight labor market persisted, reflecting an economy still experiencing excess demand. The council concluded that wage momentum was stabilizing within the range of 4% to 5%. However, persistent wage growth within this range was not seen as consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target, unless productivity increased significantly above historical trends. END"}
{"prompt":"inflation is coming down , but there is still work to do , was the message from tiff macklem , governor of the bank of canada , at a lunch in kelowna last week that included community leaders and business people . “we know higher interest rates are not easy for canadians , ” macklem said . the monetary policy is working , but not as painlessly or quickly as anybody would like . “higher interest rates are painful , but high inflation that persists is worse , ” he said . while macklem and the bank of canada board typically hold their meetings in ottawa , they sometimes meet elsewhere in the country , giving them an opportunity to get to know that community and hear what is on people’s minds . the lunch included a short speech from macklem , followed by a fireside chat with macklem and carolyn rogers , senior deputy governor at the bank of canada , who fielded questions on subjects including the bank of canada’s response to the pandemic , confidence in u . s . and canadian banks and digital currency . “inflation has reached levels that we’ve not seen in canada for almost 40 years , ” mack-lem said . “and while inflation is coming down , it is still too high . ” macklem addressed the bank of canada’s recent decision to raise its policy rate one-quarter of a percentage point . “this is the most rapid increase in interest rates in our history , ” he noted , adding it takes time for those higher interest rates to seep through the economy . the bank had paused rate increases in january to assess whether they had raised interest enough to bring inflation back to the two percent target . but over the last few months , the bank of canada has seen indicators the overheating economy has been more persistent than expected . while headline inflation , a measure of total inflation within the economy , is coming down , underlying inflation , which refers to inflation with volatile factors such as food and energy prices removed , remains sticky . “it’s not coming down as much as we’d hoped , ” said macklem . the economy is still overheated and companies are still having trouble hiring all the workers they need . “the risk is that the decline in inflation stalls , ” macklem said . “that’s really what led us to conclude that we needed to raise interest rates again . ” macklem still thinks inflation will come down to about three per cent this summer . unlike inflation , macklem noted the bank of canada does not have a target rate for unemployment . “one of the things we looked at to try and hit our inflation target is to get the labour market in a reasonable balance , ” he said , pointing out that if the labour market is tight and companies can’t find the workers they need , there are shortages and prices rise , generating inflation . when inflation is close to its two per cent target , usually the labour market is reasonably healthy . the daily courier had the opportunity to sit down with macklem one-on-one following the lunch . macklem had learned something about the local economy during his visit . the central okanagan is seeing a lot of immigration from the rest of the country and the university campus will draw young people to the community . “people want to live here , ” he said . “i can see why . ” while he sees traditional strengths in the economy such as agriculture , forestry , mining and manufacturing , macklem said the tech sector is becoming more important . although macklem said there are good things happening and a lot of opportunity , the area faces some of the same challenges as the rest of the country with labour shortages . affordable housing is an issue in the kelowna area , but macklem pointed out it’s not an issue unique to kelowna . the bank of canada looks at the housing market to factor into monetary policy , he said , but inflation is what guides their interest rates . ->","completion":" Inflation is decreasing, but there is still work to be done. That was the message conveyed by Tiff Macklem, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, during a lunch in Kelowna last week. The event included community leaders and business people, providing an opportunity for Macklem to connect with the local community and understand their concerns.\n\nMacklem acknowledged that higher interest rates can be challenging for Canadians. However, he emphasized that the monetary policy is effectively addressing the issue, albeit not as effortlessly or swiftly as desired. He explained that while higher interest rates may cause some discomfort, persistent high inflation would be far worse.\n\nDuring the lunch, Macklem delivered a brief speech and engaged in a fireside chat with Carolyn Rogers, the Senior Deputy Governor at the Bank of Canada. They discussed various topics, including the bank's response to the pandemic, confidence in US and Canadian banks, and digital currency.\n\nMacklem highlighted that inflation in Canada has reached levels unseen in almost 40 years. Although it is gradually decreasing, it remains too high. He also addressed the bank's recent decision to raise its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point. He recognized that this was the most rapid increase in interest rates in history and acknowledged that it takes time for these higher rates to impact the economy.\n\nThe bank had paused rate increases in January to evaluate whether interest rates had been raised enough to bring inflation back to the two percent target. However, recent indicators have shown that the overheating economy has persisted more than expected. While headline inflation, which includes all factors, is decreasing, underlying inflation, which excludes volatile elements like food and energy prices, remains stubborn. Macklem expressed his disappointment, stating that it is not decreasing as much as anticipated. The economy is still overheated, and companies are struggling to find enough workers.\n\nMacklem emphasized the risk of inflation decline stagnating and explained that this concern led to the decision to raise interest rates once again. However, he remains optimistic that inflation will decrease to around three percent this summer.\n\nUnlike inflation, Macklem clarified that the Bank of Canada does not have a specific target rate for unemployment. However, they do consider the labor market when aiming to achieve their inflation target. A healthy labor market indicates balance, as tight labor markets lead to worker shortages and price increases, contributing to inflation. Typically, when inflation is close to the two percent target, the labor market is also reasonably healthy.\n\nAfter the lunch, Macklem had a one-on-one discussion with the Daily Courier, where he shared his observations about the local economy. He recognized the significant immigration and the draw of the university campus, attracting young people to the central Okanagan region. He expressed admiration for the traditional strengths of the economy, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, and manufacturing. Additionally, he acknowledged the growing importance of the tech sector. However, he noted that the area, like the rest of the country, faces challenges with labor shortages. Affordable housing was also identified as an issue, although Macklem emphasized that it is not unique to Kelowna. While the Bank of Canada considers the housing market in monetary policy, their primary guide for interest rates is inflation. END"}

A recent comic by Luke McGarry depicts a man in a chaotic world, trying to pass through intimidating gatekeepers. The gatekeepers mock him for not knowing that homemade sourdough is the currency of the future. It's not just your imagination - everyone is baking bread right now. Google searches for \"bread\" and \"baking bread\" have reached a 14-year-high. You probably know someone who is into breadmaking, or maybe you are one yourself. But why are so many people suddenly obsessed with baking the perfect loaf during this pandemic?\n\nOne explanation is that making bread can be a healing experience. Stephen S. Jones, the director of Washington State University's Bread Lab, says that he has received letters from people who turned to breadmaking as a way to cope with the loss of a child. He believes that baking bread is a spiritual endeavor that connects people to something greater. We often turn to mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation to reduce anxiety and improve our well-being. But another option is to create something every day. You might choose to bake bread, revive an old hobby, or explore a completely new creative pursuit. Your daily creative task could be writing a poem, drawing a picture, or even folding origami.\n\nIn a thread on Hacker News, a user shared how the emotional turmoil of losing his father-in-law and welcoming a son inspired him to make a song every day. This creative outlet led him to start Futureland, a project network where people can document their daily creative progress. Similarly, after the 9\/11 attacks, designer Michael Bierut started drawing something every day to cope with the aftermath. This practice eventually turned into the 100-Day Project, where participants share their projects online. This year's project starts on April 7.\n\nThe goal of creating something during difficult times isn't about productivity or achieving specific outcomes. It's about using your creativity to find meaning in the situation or to channel your energy into something positive. Your daily creative practice can be as short as 20 to 60 seconds. The key is to pick something you can do consistently. For example, Bierut's student Zak Klauck challenged himself to design a poster in under 60 seconds every day. Internetvin set a goal of writing a single line of code within 20 seconds. And artist Mike Winkelmann has successfully drawn something every day for almost 5,000 days, even on the day his daughter was born.\n\nIf you're interested in starting a daily creative practice but don't know where to begin, here's some advice: you don't have to commit to 100 days, even 10 days will suffice. Just like finding the motivation to exercise during this pandemic, you'll thank yourself for making the effort. Instead of seeing this time as lost, you can choose to do something meaningful with it. Who knows, you might even create something you truly love. When all of this is over, you may look back on your daily creative practice as the one thing that made isolation bearable. END"}

It seems that the global average cost of a data breach reached an all-time high of $4.45 million in 2023, which is a 15% increase over the last three years. While this may sound concerning, there are some positive points to take away from the report.\n\nOne key finding is that detection and escalation costs have jumped 42% over the same time frame. This indicates that organizations are investing more in complex breach investigations, which shows a commitment to addressing these issues head-on. Additionally, businesses are divided on how to handle the increasing cost and frequency of data breaches. However, it is worth noting that 51% of organizations are choosing to increase their security investments, while 57% are passing incident costs onto consumers. This demonstrates a dedication to protecting customer data and finding proactive solutions.\n\nThe report is based on an analysis of real-world data breaches experienced by 553 organizations globally between March 2022 and March 2023. It is sponsored and analyzed by IBM Security and conducted by the Ponemon Institute, a well-respected research organization. This report has been published for 18 consecutive years, providing valuable insights into the ever-changing landscape of data breaches.\n\nSome key findings from the report include the significant impact of AI and automation on the speed of breach identification and containment. Organizations that extensively use these technologies experienced breach lifecycles that were 108 days shorter compared to those that have not deployed them. This not only saves time but also significantly lowers incident costs, with organizations deploying AI and automation seeing almost $1.8 million in cost savings.\n\nAnother interesting aspect highlighted by the report is the importance of involving law enforcement during a ransomware attack. Those organizations that did involve law enforcement saved an average of $470,000 in breach costs compared to those that chose not to involve them. Despite this potential benefit, 37% of ransomware victims surveyed did not involve law enforcement, likely due to misconceptions around the complications it may bring. It is important to understand that involving law enforcement can lead to shorter breach lifecycles and lower incident costs.\n\nFurthermore, the report emphasizes the need for stronger threat detection and response. While there has been progress in halting ransomware attacks, adversaries still find ways to slip through the cracks. Alarmingly, only one in three studied breaches were detected by the organization's own security teams or tools, with 27% being disclosed by the attacker themselves. This underscores the importance of continuous improvement in security measures to stay one step ahead.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report provides valuable insights into the current state of data breaches and the measures organizations are taking to address this growing concern.

It's understandable that those responsible for protecting their companies from cyberattacks may feel on edge these days. According to a study, hackers attempt to breach computer systems every 39 seconds. However, Jim Mills, the composed leader of RBC's Cyber Resiliency and Response Program, remains calm and collected. He attributes his demeanor to his father, who always maintained a calm approach, even when Jim and his brother made mistakes as kids. Jim's cool and collected character should not be confused with complacency. Instead, it reflects the quiet confidence of a well-prepared team that is ready for anything.\n\nJim compares his cyber resilience and response team to the best first responders in the physical world. He emphasizes the importance of training, running scenarios, and continuously practicing their craft. This allows their actions to become instinctual, so they can respond swiftly without needing to consult a playbook. Even during quieter times, the team remains vigilant, monitoring the billions of daily events within Canada's largest bank. However, the work is more rewarding than relentless for Jim, a 25-year employee of RBC. He explains that the team thrives on the knowledge that their efforts matter. Clients have entrusted them with their business, and protecting their assets and information is their purpose and source of pride.\n\nOne key group within Jim's team is the Security Operations Centre, which will celebrate its 10-year anniversary in 2023. This team of 25 experts provides RBC with a comprehensive view of cybersecurity. The speed at which they built the necessary infrastructure and protocols underscores the importance placed on the initiative by RBC's leadership team and board of directors. Jim mentions that it only took a matter of months, rather than years, to incorporate every security log source and establish custom rules for threat detection. Their technology partner even commended them for the efficiency and effectiveness of the rollout.\n\nUltimately, RBC's quick and expansive development of cybersecurity capabilities represents a shift in mindset. Cybersecurity is now seen as a critical business enabler, as demonstrated by how their efforts helped transform various aspects of the bank into a virtual operation during the pandemic. The \"360 perspective\" provided by the Security Operations Centre helps the cyber resilience and response team identify potential threats and understand their origins. This knowledge is crucial in pinpointing the root cause of incidents and improving the bank's defense systems.\n\nJim doesn't disclose many details about the specific attacks the bank faces but mentions that threat actors have shifted from vandalizing infrastructure to monetizing their cybercrime activities. As previously reported by RBC Stories, cyberattacks have become a profitable business, projected to cost global companies over $10 trillion by 2025. To strengthen their response, the Security Operations Centre has published a framework that outlines effective incident management steps, along with standardized email and calendar templates. This ensures consistent communication by RBC's incident managers.\n\nMany small and medium-sized businesses that partner with larger firms like RBC may lack the resources to combat sophisticated threat actors. That's why Jim's team collaborates with RBC's Supplier Management Office to share insights on emerging threats. They also work directly with bank clients to help them better protect their businesses. The team's goal is to assist business owners and operators in focusing on areas where they can have the greatest impact in mitigating risk and setting up their firms for long-term success. END"}

Even someone as optimistic as Sid Paquette acknowledges that there are challenges when it comes to the increasing presence of global tech giants in Canada. However, Sid sees the influx of venture capital funding from international investors as a positive sign for Canada's innovation ecosystem and its future prospects. He believes that if investors are willing to make significant investments in Canadian talent, it demonstrates that our ecosystem is world-class. Canada has a diverse talent base, excellent educational institutions, and strong incentives that make it an attractive place for businesses to grow.\n\nThe growing interest in all things Canadian has elevated the country's reputation on the global stage and has led to significant growth in the tech industry. However, Sid believes that foreign investment alone is not enough for Canada to reach its full potential. He believes that Canada needs more locally-grown companies that can scale globally and achieve the same level of growth as global firms. Sid, who has extensive experience in leading investments in technology and start-ups, believes that there are several factors in place to make this happen. Canada offers favorable incentives for intellectual property creation, a supportive environment for research and development, and the resources needed to create and hire for new companies. However, to truly capitalize on these opportunities, the Canadian ecosystem needs to improve its commercialization capabilities.\n\nSid suggests revamping intellectual property laws to make it more difficult for multinationals to acquire Canadian innovations that were funded with public dollars. He also proposes incentivizing talent to stay in Canada and streamlining the immigration process to help newcomers settle faster. Additionally, banks can play a role in growing the tech and innovation ecosystem by better leveraging their capabilities in providing capital.\n\nThat's where RBCx comes in. RBCx has recently joined forces with RBC Ventures to provide value to tech entrepreneurs at all stages of growth and help scale their operations. The synergy between the two operations allows RBCx to combine the expertise, networks, and skill sets of both teams.

Two years later, this dream is becoming a reality for twelve youth from the Lac-Simon Indigenous community, thanks in part to RBC Training Ground.\n\nGrowing up in Montreal, Féquière aspired to be a gymnast. However, she quickly realized that her busy mother, who worked two jobs to support their family, couldn't afford to enroll her in organized sports. Determined to pursue athletics, she turned her attention to running. Later in life, after an injury prevented her from running long distances, Féquière discovered swimming, which ultimately led her to triathlon. While participating in triathlon events, she noticed the lack of visible minorities alongside her. This prompted her to approach the Lac-Simon Algonquin community with the idea of creating a triathlon program.\n\nInitially, Féquière's proposal was met with a lukewarm reception, given the circumstances of her being a Black woman from Montreal approaching their reservation. However, after the first edition of the Triathlon des Nations, Féquière spoke to the community again and exclaimed that while Val d'Or may have gold, Lac-Simon possessed raw diamonds ready to shine. This resonated with them, and Féquière continued to create opportunities for the youth from Lac-Simon, including organizing a weekend trip to participate in RBC Training Ground.\n\nOn April 23, twelve young athletes mentored by Féquière participated in RBC Training Ground's qualifying event in Montreal. They showcased their speed, power, strength, and endurance in front of representatives from various national sport organizations, including Triathlon Canada. Féquière states, \"For this youth, RBC Training Ground provides a tangible pathway to their Olympic dreams. But I also believe it can become a pathway to so much more!\"\n\nDuring their time at RBC Training Ground, the young triathletes from Lac-Simon also had the opportunity to meet members of Mohawk communities from around Montreal during a \"One Tepee Two Nations\" cultural gathering. Additionally, they enjoyed a behind-the-scenes visit to the labs at the Montreal Insectarium.\n\nRBC Training Ground acknowledges that high-performance sport should be accessible to all young athletes. They recognize the need to make their program more inclusive for BIPOC communities. Shannon Cole, Vice-President of Brand Marketing at RBC, emphasizes the importance of supporting athletes like Féquière and her community through their local events.\n\nIn addition to encouraging indigenous athletes to participate in regular qualifying events, RBC Training Ground hosted custom testing events for North American Indigenous Games (NAIG) athletes this year, with over 300 participants.

Suddenly, Christina and her sister stood out for being different. From the contents of their lunchboxes to their appearance, they faced teasing and derogatory remarks. Even their family home was vandalized. These experiences made Christina feel resentful about her identity and she began covering up her heritage in an attempt to fit in. Her mother also altered her presentation to be accepted and respected. It took years for Christina to embrace her authentic self and feel comfortable with who she was.\n\nWhen Christina joined RBC, she found a welcoming environment that celebrated diversity. Previously, she had experienced bias, discrimination, and felt like an outsider in other workplaces. But at RBC, she saw people proud of their heritage, which encouraged her to explore her own identity. Working at RBC helped build her confidence and self-acceptance.\n\nBefore leading the Diversity & Inclusion team, Christina held a role on the learning and performance team, working with strategy owners to drive employee growth and development. She also supported the inclusion and belonging learning portfolio. In 2020, following events like the murder of George Floyd and social unrest, there was a greater willingness to have conversations about racism, discrimination, and bias. Christina's team provided resources on these topics as well as understanding microaggressions, unlocking potential through inclusivity, and becoming allies.\n\nWith Christina's background in brain-based coaching and sustainable learning, her connection with the Diversity & Inclusion team was strong, leading to her natural alignment with leading the team.

However, her connection to farming goes even deeper, as her family has been farming in Canada for over 100 years, providing cereals for our breakfast tables and grass for livestock to graze. With her firsthand experience managing nearly 30,000 acres of farmland, Janet understands the challenges that farmers face, especially when it comes to costs.\n\nIn a recent interview, Janet highlighted that costs are currently the biggest concern for farmers. The world's demand for food has a significant impact on prices, and managing these costs has become more challenging than farming itself. This issue affects not only farmers but all Canadians, as rising prices are partly due to disruptions in supply chains and international security challenges.\n\nOne of the key agricultural regions in the world, Ukraine, has been limited in its ability to supply global markets due to war, further impacting the global food supply already affected by the pandemic. For example, fertilizer prices have risen by up to 300% in 2022. While larger farms can better handle this volatility, smaller and mid-sized farms have less control over input costs. With rising commodity prices and input costs, farmers must now rely on shopping around or timing the market to find the right price, adding an unwelcome burden to their love of working the land.\n\nMoreover, persistent supply disruptions caused by COVID-19 have hindered farmers' plans to upgrade or replace equipment and machinery. Machinery and equipment are now more expensive and harder to find, and suppliers often struggle to provide delivery dates or final prices due to constrained supply. This makes budget planning significantly more challenging for farmers. Rising loan rates have also doubled loan payment costs for clients, requiring more frequent and in-depth conversations about cash flow and the need to adapt to this environment.\n\nDespite these challenges, a climate-conscious world is asking farmers to do more. Climate disruption, global population growth, economic volatility, and geopolitical stability all put immense pressure on Canada's farms to feed the world sustainably. RBC Economics & Thought Leadership recently published a report titled \"Fertile Ground: How Soil Carbon Can be a Cash Crop for the Climate Age,\" which explores three ways to mobilize the capital necessary to reduce emissions from Canada's agriculture sector.\n\nAccording to Mohamad Yaghi, the Ag Policy Lead at RBC Thought Leadership and the report's author, sustainable practices can empower farmers to cut emissions, improve air and water quality, soil health, and biodiversity. However, there are significant economic obstacles that prevent farmers from adopting these practices. The report identifies three financial instruments that could help provide the necessary capital: carbon offsets, carbon insets, and government funding. Among these options, insetting and government funding hold the greatest potential to make an immediate impact.\n\nIn conclusion, Janet Heathcoat's extensive experience and personal connection to farming highlight the challenges farmers face in managing costs and adapting to a changing world. However, RBC's recent report emphasizes the potential for sustainable practices to reduce emissions and improve the overall health of our environment. By providing the necessary capital through financial instruments like insetting and government funding, farmers can make a significant and immediate impact in moving towards sustainable agriculture.

RBC, for example, has set an ambitious goal to decrease its GHG emissions in its operations by 70% by 2025. One important step towards achieving this goal is sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable and non-emitting sources like wind and solar power.\n\nAccording to Julia-Maria Becker, Senior Manager of Sustainable Enterprise Operations at RBC, there are various ways they can accomplish this. However, investing in new renewable energy projects that directly contribute to Canada's energy transition is key. This is where power purchase agreements (PPAs) come into play. A PPA is a long-term contract with a renewable energy project owner to purchase energy at a fixed price from a solar or wind farm that is connected to the electrical grid. \n\nPPAs have had a significant impact on renewable energy development in North America, as stated by Grant Arnold, President and CEO of BluEarth Renewables. Corporate buyers like RBC have played a crucial role in driving the growth of renewables over the past five years. In 2020, RBC signed a PPA with BluEarth Renewables to support the construction of two new utility-scale solar farms in Alberta. They also signed a PPA in March 2022 with Berkshire Hathaway Energy Canada (BHE Canada) to aid in the development of the Rattlesnake Wind Power Project in Medicine Hat, Alberta. \n\nBy entering into a PPA, the project owner gains greater certainty since the purchaser has agreed to a fixed price. This guarantee provides the confidence needed to proceed with construction. Chris Deakin, Manager of Corporate Development with BHE Canada, explains that PPAs help by providing income certainty, enabling necessary investments. As a renewables' developer, BHE Canada's strategy is to own and operate long-term projects that create a meaningful impact.\n\nThe benefits of PPAs are widespread. For RBC, they contribute to progress towards their climate goals by providing predictable access to renewable electricity while supporting the construction of renewable energy facilities in Canada. Deakin highlights that the benefit for energy consumers is the long-term predictable supply of electricity. Communities also reap advantages, including job creation during construction. The Bluearth Yellow Lake and Burdett Solar Project alone created over 300 new construction jobs, while BHE Canada's wind project provided approximately 150 new construction jobs at its peak. In the long term, these projects stimulate the local economy, with the partners estimating an injection of $200 million into Alberta's economy. \n\nIn terms of climate impact, the clean electricity purchased by RBC from these projects is expected to prevent 41,200 tonnes of emissions each year. This is equivalent to approximately 680,000 tree seedlings grown for 10 years or 167 million fewer kilometers driven. Moreover, the advancement of these projects demonstrates that renewable energy is cost-competitive in an open market. PPAs also facilitate green investment in the Alberta economy. Contrary to popular belief, renewables have become more affordable, with wind power dropping 72% in price since 2009 and solar power decreasing by 90%, making it the cheapest form of new energy, according to the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2020.

However, it's important to consider other factors that are becoming increasingly important. Here are four considerations that can have significant benefits:\n\n1. Relevant Benefits for the Real World: Gone are the days when free snacks and a ping-pong table were the main reasons to work somewhere. Nowadays, Canadian employees value meaningful support in both work and life. A flexible benefit plan that caters to their needs in various life stages is at the top of their list. David Schwarz, who leads compensations and benefits at RBC, explains that employees appreciate premium offerings that support their mental wellbeing, physical health, and financial planning. Providing a modern and comprehensive benefits experience helps employees during crucial moments in their career, whether they are just starting out or approaching retirement. Short-term financial goals are also important, and Nicholas Mizera was able to save around $250 on monthly bills through discounts and savings available to RBC employees. Taking advantage of employee pricing on telecom plans, home and auto insurance, and a credit card that offers rewards points to cover its annual fee allowed him to have peace of mind and be able to say \"yes\" to his daughter's requests for books or toys.\n\n2. Work Where You Can Be You: The workplace experience is positively impacted by intangible benefits such as acceptance and belonging. Being able to express who you are at work is crucial, according to Christina Cleveland, RBC's Vice President of Global Diversity & Inclusion. RBC encourages a sense of belonging through employee resource groups (ERGs), which allow more than 32,000 employees to participate in groups centered around common identities, characteristics, or interests. ERGs make it easier for team members to find their community and engage with issues that matter to them both inside and outside of work. Kaelan Karjalainen found her community as an active volunteer with the Greater Toronto Area Pride ERG. Through this group, she has been able to bring her ideas to life and support the 2SLGBTQ+ community through employee engagement events such as marching in Pride parades, fundraising events for National Coming Out Day, and virtual Pride celebrations during the pandemic.\n\n3. Making an Impact: Since a majority of our time is devoted to work, employees want their work to be meaningful, especially millennials and Gen Z. Data from Great Place to Work shows that these generations place a strong emphasis on doing work that matters to them, and they are three times more likely to stay with a company if they feel a sense of purpose. Ashley Tidd, a mortgage specialist at RBC, finds her role rewarding as she plays an important part in helping clients and families achieve a major milestone of homeownership. She builds relationships with her clients throughout the mortgage process and finds it fulfilling to help them achieve their lifelong goal of owning a home. Making an impact can also extend to the community, as employees are more likely to seek work at socially responsible organizations that have charitable giving programs, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\nBy considering these four factors, jobseekers can find a fulfilling and rewarding career that aligns with their values and priorities.

However, building trust isn't always easy, which is why Liane Davey has spent the last 25 years advising companies on its importance in the workplace. Liane, a New York Times best-selling author and teamwork coach, helps organizations understand the significance of this small word that holds great meaning.\n\nAccording to research from Harvard Business Review, employees in high-trust companies reap several benefits. They are more productive, have more energy at work, collaborate better with colleagues, and tend to stay with their employers for longer compared to those in low-trust companies. Recently, Liane spoke to people managers at RBC as part of an initiative to develop leadership skills, and now she shares her insights with a wider audience, including how our brains perceive trust, the impact of the pandemic, and practical ways to enhance trust in the workplace.\n\nAt the core, trust comes down to whom we rely on. Our brains interpret messages differently depending on the source of the information. When we receive feedback from co-workers we don't trust, it can lead to frustration and doubt. On the other hand, when feedback comes from someone we trust, we are more receptive. Liane explains that people are wired to process neutral information differently based on the level of trustworthiness. Trust serves as a form of psychological safety, making it easier for us to be vulnerable with those we trust. When employees are comfortable taking risks, it boosts team effectiveness. These risks include sharing information, asking for help, working through challenging situations, and supporting others – all of which can be achieved through trust.\n\nAccording to Erin Stein, who oversees leadership development and culture at RBC, trust is foundational to all aspects of work. It is particularly crucial for people managers to establish trust with their teams because that's when teams perform their best. Liane identifies four levels of trust: connection, competency, reliability, and integrity. Establishing connection is the first step, but it became more challenging during the pandemic due to the lack of easy trust-building in a virtual environment. There was a lack of mutual knowledge since we couldn't see what was happening in each other's lives. For instance, during a virtual call, others couldn't see your child off-camera asking for a snack. Liane suggests building trust by engaging in non-task-related activities together, such as organizing virtual lunches. Another subtle tactic is wearing your company gear to reinforce the sense of belonging to the same team.\n\nEarly establishment of connection with teammates is crucial. As the saying goes, \"Don't wait until you're thirsty to dig a well.\" We can incorporate trust-building skills into our everyday routines. For example, when team members identify and address issues promptly, a simple \"thank you\" acknowledges and encourages proactive behavior. Integrity is another essential behavior that everyone can model by admitting mistakes and learning from them quickly. Trust also depends on discretion. Leaders should avoid discussing sensitive issues with the entire team, as it can lead to gossip. If you need to share something, confide in a peer instead. Finally, effective listening is the most important skill. At RBC, listening is a core behavior demonstrated by leaders. By truly listening, we gain perspective and show compassion, leading to better outcomes. Listening involves paying attention not only to what is said but also to body language, where feelings and emotions often manifest.

She had always dreamed of a career in theatre, with singing and dancing being her passion since childhood. She attended a prestigious musical theatre program in college and even had the opportunity to perform in London's West End. However, after facing the realities of the theatre industry, including long hours and irregular schedules, Erin realized she needed a change.\n\nIn 2012, Erin found herself soul-searching back in Canada. Unsure of her next steps, she decided to return to RBC, where she had previously worked during her college summers. Little did she know that this temporary decision would lead to an unexpected career path. Today, as a senior relationship manager in commercial financial services, Erin proudly refers to herself as the \"accidental banker.\"\n\nAlthough Erin initially thought numbers were boring, she soon discovered that they were just one piece of the puzzle in her role. Transitioning careers midway is common, as Lisa Melo, RBC's Vice President of Learning & Performance, confirms. RBC is committed to supporting employees during these transitions through learning programs and upskilling opportunities. Assessments, coaching, and on-the-job practice help employees succeed in their new roles.\n\nErin benefited from training and mentorship programs that aided her transition. To her surprise, she realized that she possessed many transferable skills from her theatre background, such as interacting with diverse individuals, adapting quickly, and a hunger for continuous learning.

Younger Canadians, who are working towards a down payment for their first home, are especially interested in this tax-free account. Flora Do, Vice President of Investments Transformation & Client Segments at RBC, mentioned that since the launch in April, tens of thousands of RBC FHSAs have been opened by Canadians. This early response to this innovative savings and investment option is remarkable.\n\nRBC offers the FHSA through their online investment services, RBC Direct Investing and RBC Investease, as well as RBC Online Banking. Financial advisors at any RBC branch are also available to assist clients in learning more about the RBC FHSA and how it compares to other investment options that can support them on their journey to homeownership. Additionally, RBC is helping future home buyers understand the diverse range of investments they can hold within their RBC FHSA. Clients can invest in stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, GICs, options, and bonds through RBC Direct Investing. For those who prefer a professional approach, RBC Investease offers a team of portfolio advisors who will select, buy, and manage a portfolio of ETFs aligned with the client's goals, objectives, and risk tolerance.\n\nThe maximum yearly contribution to the FHSA is $8,000, and contribution room only starts accumulating after opening an FHSA. Unused contribution room carries forward to the next calendar year. More than a quarter (26%) of RBC FHSA holders have already contributed the maximum annual amount, and the same percentage are regularly contributing through pre-authorized contributions (PACs). It is incredible to see Canadians taking advantage of the opportunity to open and contribute to FHSA accounts right away, bringing their dream of homeownership closer to reality and benefiting from the tax deduction before the end of the 2023 calendar year.\n\nMaking regular contributions through PACs has an added benefit of preparing individuals for monthly or bi-monthly mortgage payments once they purchase their home. \n\nHere are some interesting insights about RBC FHSA holders:\n\n1. The majority (56%) of RBC FHSA holders are aged 25 to 34. \n2. 20% of FHSA holders are aged 35 to 44, 18% are aged 18 to 24, and 6% are aged 45+.\n3. More than a quarter (26%) of RBC FHSA holders are contributing regularly through PACs, giving themselves a head start on saving and investing for their down payment.\n4. Another 26% of RBC FHSA holders have already contributed the maximum annual amount of $8,000, maximizing the available tax deduction for the 2023 calendar year.\n5. As of June 30, over 5% of RBC FHSA account holders have made qualifying tax-free withdrawals for their down payment, benefiting from the available tax deduction for the 2023 calendar year. This demonstrates how RBC FHSAs are helping Canadians with both their short-term and long-term goals.\n6. The most common securities held in RBC FHSAs are ETFs and stocks. As of June 23, 2023, mutual funds are now also available as an investment option through RBC Direct Investing, in addition to a variety of GICs.\n7. Canadians with FHSAs who don't pursue homeownership can use their FHSA funds for their eventual retirement. They can transfer their FHSA funds tax-free into their RRSP or RRIF, with no impact on their contribution limits to those accounts. END"}

Sadly, six cadets aged between 14 and 15 lost their lives, and many others were injured. The incident took place when inert explosive devices were being passed around the class, and a live grenade was accidentally mixed in. Despite the instructor's assurance that it was safe, the grenade exploded, causing devastation.\n\nImmediate action was taken, and the victims were rushed to the base hospital. Those with more serious injuries were stabilized and then transported to nearby civilian hospitals. Alongside the tragic loss of life, one cadet was left permanently and totally disabled. Several others suffered permanent disabilities such as the loss of an eye, shrapnel wounds, loss of hearing, and psychological trauma. This incident prompted several investigations, including a coroner's report in 1975 that ruled the deaths of the six cadets were caused by negligence.\n\nBackground: The office of the ombudsman received its first complaint about this matter in April 2013, followed by an additional 51 complaints over a three-month period. These complaints mainly focused on issues such as access to medical care for long-term injuries, lack of support for those still suffering, recognition from the government of Canada, the need for a formal apology, and financial compensation.\n\nThe ombudsman's mandate does not cover events that occurred before June 15, 1998, unless the Minister of National Defence deems it in the public interest to investigate. However, due to the compelling issues and perceived discrepancies in treatment, the office recommended to the Minister of National Defence that a pre-mandate investigation be conducted. Former Minister Rob Nicholson agreed on May 5, 2014.\n\nObjectives of the investigation: Our objective was twofold: to determine whether those present at the time of the explosion were treated fairly and compassionately based on the standards in place at that time, and to establish the present-day responsibility, if any, of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces toward the individuals affected by this tragic event.\n\nFindings and recommendations: The ombudsman's office discovered that many of the cadets who survived the explosion continue to suffer from physical and psychological injuries. However, these cadets did not receive the same level of assistance as the military members who were also impacted by the incident. This discrepancy goes against the principle of fairness. The report states that the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence should have done more to help the young boys under their care. Therefore, it is recommended that, following a thorough assessment of the long-term needs of the affected individuals, the Department of National Defence, under the minister's guidance, provide them with immediate and reasonable financial compensation in line with similar situations in the legal system. This is essential to ensure they are treated in a manner that reflects Canadian values. END"}

He kindly asked them to update their processes and information on Canada.ca to ensure that taxpayer right 15 of the taxpayer bill of rights, \"you have the right to be represented by a person of your choice,\" is respected.\n\nAt the recent Chartered Professional Accountants Forum North, we were made aware of concerns regarding the CRA's approach in their assisted compliance program. Upon examining their webpage, we discovered that some content was suggesting that Canadians should contact the CRA before reaching out to their tax preparer, who may also be their authorized representative. This could potentially create an issue, as taxpayers often rely on their representatives for tax planning and may not fully understand the intricate details themselves.\n\nA similar issue was identified during our examination of the CRA's audit process for charities. We found that auditors were directed to contact a director of a charity instead of the authorized representative, even when previously informed to contact the representative for financial matters. While we understand that there may be instances where contacting the authorized representative is not the most efficient approach, such as with undisputed debt collection, it is crucial for the CRA to respect a taxpayer's request to contact their representative.\n\nTherefore, in our service improvement request, we asked the CRA to update their publicly available information to remove any instances where they suggest that a taxpayer contact them first instead of their chosen representative. We are pleased to report that after receiving our request, the CRA promptly informed us that they were already in the process of updating their assisted compliance program webpage. We were delighted to see that the flagged content has been removed. However, we believe that the CRA shouldn't stop there and should continue to seek opportunities to enhance the ease of interaction between taxpayers and their representatives.\n\nTo provide some background, the office of the taxpayers' ombudsperson operates independently of the CRA. Canadians can submit complaints to our office if they feel they are not receiving appropriate service from the CRA. Our main goal is to improve the service provided by the CRA to taxpayers and benefit recipients. We achieve this by reviewing individual service complaints and addressing service issues that affect multiple people or specific segments of the population. As the ombudsperson, it is our duty to assist, advise, and inform the Minister of National Revenue on matters relating to the services provided by the CRA. We ensure that the CRA respects eight of the service rights outlined in the taxpayer bill of rights.\n\nOverall, we are optimistic about the progress made in updating the CRA's assisted compliance program webpage. It is essential for the CRA to continue seeking ways to make interactions with taxpayers and their representatives easier. END"}

For more information, please visit the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise website.\n\nCORE is currently providing an update on the initial assessment of a complaint filed by a coalition of 28 Canadian organizations on June 21, 2022, regarding the activities of Ralph Lauren Canada LP (RLCLP). As part of the process, all parties involved have been given the opportunity to share their thoughts on the report's findings. You can find a summary of these comments in Part 5 of the report.\n\nThe complainants consist of a coalition of 28 Canadian organizations, and RLCLP is a limited partnership registered in Ontario since April 5, 2011, with its main office in Toronto, Ontario. It's important to note that RLCLP has been inactive since April 4, 2022. The complaint alleges that RLCLP has business relationships with companies that use or benefit from forced labor by Uyghurs. While some information and reports mention \"Ralph Lauren,\" it is unclear whether this refers to the parent company, Ralph Lauren Corporation (RLC), RLCLP, or the Ralph Lauren brand as a whole. However, the complaint specifically alleges that RLCLP is involved in using or benefiting from forced labor in its supply chain.\n\nThe complaint includes bills of lading, which provide evidence that RLCLP has received shipments from a Chinese company called Esquel Textile Co. Ltd. (Esquel). The Australian Strategic Policy Institute's (ASPI) report titled \"Uyghurs for Sale\" identifies Esquel as a company that uses or benefits from Uyghur forced labor. The complainants also reference ASPI's report, which identifies Youngor Textile Holdings Co. Ltd.

These solutions offer several advantages over traditional mobile networks, including lower battery consumption and extended connectivity range. However, it's crucial to note that not all LPWAN technologies are equal. Let's take a closer look at the various services available and what factors to consider when selecting the right one for your business.\n\nLPWAN Options: Unlicensed vs. Licensed\nThere are two main categories of LPWAN technologies. Unlicensed LPWANs operate on proprietary technologies that utilize unlicensed radio spectrum. This means that anyone can use the frequency. These networks are primarily designed for transmitting small messages in urban areas. On the other hand, licensed LPWANs, also known as Mobile IoT by the GSMA, use radio spectrum exclusively licensed to specific carriers. These networks adhere to international standards, enabling seamless and reliable connections across different networks. One example of a licensed LPWAN is LTE-M, which leverages the existing LTE infrastructure to provide extensive coverage.\n\nImportant Criteria to Consider\nWhen selecting an LPWAN technology, organizations must ensure that it fully supports their IoT goals. Peter Wilcox, the Director of IoT and Business Solutions at Bell Canada, highlights four key criteria to consider:\n\n1. Coverage: The distribution of your IoT devices plays a crucial role in determining the suitable technology. Do you require coverage over a limited or wide area? Are your devices located in challenging areas, such as underground or below ground? Are they stationary or mobile? If you don't need extensive coverage (e.g., less than 10 kilometers in urban areas) and your devices are easily reachable or mobile, an unlicensed LPWAN may be a cost-effective option. On the other hand, if you need to reach devices distributed across a wide area or in challenging locations like deep inside buildings or underground, LTE-M services are better suited. These makes licensed LPWANs ideal for smart city applications that monitor devices below ground, such as water pressure sensors. The transportation industry, which requires mobile asset tracking, should consider a licensed LTE-M service as it enables quick and seamless data transfer from moving vehicles.\n\n2. Security: Data sensitivity is a crucial factor when choosing an LPWAN technology. Organizations should consider the level of sensitivity of the transmitted data in terms of both privacy and business importance. Unlicensed networks, like LoRa, offer two layers of security and encryption. However, they use shared frequencies and are susceptible to interference and attacks. If data sensitivity is a concern, licensed LTE-M networks ensure message integrity and only allow valid devices to communicate over the network, similar to current cellular networks.\n\n3. Reliability: Does your IoT solution require fast or real-time data delivery? Not all applications necessitate high speed. For those that don't, an unlicensed network may suffice. Generally, unlicensed networks experience latency of up to 30 seconds compared to 50 milliseconds on LTE-M, as stated by Wilcox. LTE-M is better suited for mission-critical applications or those that require real-time information delivery. As Wilcox suggests, if a utility company needs to make a real-time decision based on sensor data, a licensed network may be the optimal choice.\n\n4. Flexibility: Organizations should also consider the flexibility they might require in the future. Will there be a need for periodic software updates on the devices? Is adaptability to future technology trends, such as 5G, necessary? Unlicensed networks are based on proprietary technology and may be suitable for organizations that don't require a high degree of flexibility. Licensed networks, on the other hand, are standards-based and more suitable for organizations that prioritize flexibility. For example, Bell's 5G-ready LTE-M network allows remote software updates, which cannot be done on an unlicensed network.\n\nBy carefully considering these criteria, organizations can make an informed decision when selecting an LPWAN technology that aligns with their IoT goals and business requirements.

This constant communication has numerous benefits, including ensuring accurate and timely deliveries, allowing for real-time re-routing based on changing road conditions, and contributing to regulatory compliance. However, it's important to acknowledge that there are risks involved when drivers use devices while on the move.\n\nStudies have shown that distracted drivers are up to eight times more likely to be involved in a crash than those who keep their eyes on the road. Even a few seconds of looking at a mobile device while traveling at high speeds can be equivalent to driving blindfolded for the length of a football field. It's crucial to find a way to improve safety without sacrificing the advantages of continuous communication.\n\nThis is where advanced mobile technologies, like push-to-talk (PTT), come into play. PTT is a communication solution that instantly connects users over various networks, such as 4G LTE, 3G, and Wi-Fi. By using PTT, dispatchers can have better insight into the status of their drivers, reducing unnecessary contact and distractions. They can also broadcast time-critical information directly to drivers' mobile phones, allowing for quick responses without the need to unlock their devices. PTT also provides vehicle location and tracking information, ensuring that dispatchers always know the whereabouts of their fleet.\n\nIn addition, Bluetooth accessories, such as steering wheel buttons, enable drivers to respond instantly to calls without taking their focus off the road. By implementing PTT, transportation companies can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and create a safer driving environment for their employees.\n\nChoosing a security-encrypted carrier-grade PTT solution is essential for transportation companies that prioritize secure, reliable, and high-quality voice communications nationwide. Bell Mobility offers access to Canada's largest LTE network and coast-to-coast coverage, ensuring instant and dependable connectivity in both Canada and the U.S. Their PTT solution is backed by end-to-end support from experts in the field. Bell also provides an integrated PTT solution that includes a comprehensive dispatch console, a contact management tool, and an advanced smartphone app.\n\nFor transportation companies that face pressure to meet customer expectations, technologies like PTT offer a convenient and reliable way to stay connected and effectively manage routes and drivers. Furthermore, the same network that supports PTT can also accommodate other essential mobile capabilities, such as fleet management solutions and electronic logging devices (ELDs), which will soon become mandatory according to Transport Canada regulations.\n\nIt's important to prioritize safety when exploring these solutions, as the well-being of drivers is paramount.

Starting with Andy Warhol's famous Coca-Cola painting from 1962, the bottle travels through a diverse mix of classic and contemporary paintings, ultimately ending up in the hands of an art student in need of inspiration.\n\nThis campaign, part of our \"real magic\" brand platform, highlights how Coca-Cola provides uplifting refreshment in meaningful moments. The centerpiece of the campaign is a short film set in an art museum, where students are sketching paintings on display. As one student feels uninspired, an arm from a painting reaches out to grab the Coke bottle from Warhol's masterpiece. From there, the bottle continues its journey through iconic works like JMW Turner's \"The Shipwreck,\" Munch's \"The Scream\", and Van Gogh's \"Bedroom in Arles,\" until it finally reaches Vermeer's \"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\" The subject of the painting opens the bottle, providing inspiration and refreshment to the student.\n\nIn addition to these well-known paintings from the past century, the film also features artwork from emerging artists from Africa, India, the Middle East, and Latin America. By bridging the worlds of classical and contemporary art, this campaign showcases the power of artistic expression from different cultures.\n\n\"'Masterpiece' is not just a story with Coke appearing, Coke is the story,\" says Pratik Thakar, Global Head of Creative Strategy and Integrated Content for Coca-Cola. \"Just like our synchronized supply chain delivers ice-cold Coca-Cola at the right time, a diverse collection of artwork comes together to uplift a teenager.

According to a new energy outlook from the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), electricity would play a leading role in reshaping the energy mix, along with contributions from hydrogen, bioenergy, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).\n\nThe report titled \"Canada's Energy Future 2023 Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2050\" presents three scenarios: global net-zero, Canada net-zero, and current measures. Each scenario reflects the pace of climate action in Canada and globally, with two specifically aimed at achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada by 2050.\n\nIn both net-zero scenarios, electricity would become the most important energy source for Canadians, resulting in a significant decrease in the use of fossil fuels by 2050. This transition would involve replacing current technologies with electricity-powered alternatives, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. The increased reliance on electricity would also improve energy efficiency nationwide, leading to a potential decrease in energy usage of up to 22% by 2050.\n\nTo meet the increased electricity demand, Canada would generate more clean electricity from sources like wind, nuclear, and hydro. Fossil fuel electricity generation without CCUS would decline rapidly due to stronger climate policies. Wind energy, in particular, is expected to contribute the most to new electricity generation by 2050, growing over ninefold from current levels in both net-zero scenarios.\n\nOverall, the electricity sector is projected to achieve net-zero emissions by 2035 and become net-negative thereafter by utilizing bioenergy with CCUS. The oil and gas industry would also significantly reduce emissions using various technologies throughout the projection period. Additionally, global climate action would impact global demand and prices for oil and gas, leading to a decline in production in Canada by 2050, especially in the global net-zero scenario.\n\nHowever, fossil fuels would still have a role in Canada's energy system, particularly in industrial facilities equipped with CCUS or for non-energy purposes like asphalt and petrochemicals. Achieving net-zero emissions would require significant contributions from all sectors, with the largest reductions expected in the transportation, electricity, and oil and gas sectors.\n\nThe report acknowledges that certain sectors such as buildings, heavy industry, and oil and gas may still have positive GHG emissions by 2050 in both net-zero scenarios. However, net-negative emissions from other sectors, including the electricity sector, would offset these positive emissions.\n\nThe Canada Energy Regulator (CER) strives to provide timely, fact-based, and relevant energy analysis to inform discussions about energy in Canada. This long-term outlook on Canadian energy supply and demand covers all energy commodities and provinces, and makes projections using economic and energy models. It's important to note that the results presented in EF2023 are not predictions or policy recommendations. Instead, they are scenarios based on specific premises and assumptions. END"}

In a highly competitive retail environment, this flexibility is critical. Big brands need the ability to choose what they need to boost their top-line performance without compromising their entire platform.\n\nSo, why is Shop Pay so powerful? It's all thanks to four key advantages: Shopify's extensive identity network, unrivaled scale, consumer trust, and commitment to innovation.

This means that even the world's largest brands will be able to offer their customers a seamless and accurate search experience.\n\nHarley Finkelstein, the President of Shopify, stated, \"Our partnership with Google Cloud combines the best of commerce and search, opening up a trillion-dollar opportunity for brands. We understand that 69% of US consumers rely on a store's search feature when shopping, yet only around 10% consistently receive accurate results. It's a significant issue that we are eager to help enterprise retailers overcome through our ongoing collaboration with Google.\"\n\nGoogle Cloud's Discovery AI solutions offer a range of capabilities, including advanced understanding and improved results for even the most general search queries. This includes matching product attributes with store content, facilitating fast and relevant product discovery. Additionally, the AI-powered personalization feature optimizes product display and ordering based on a shopper's category preferences, such as women's jackets or kitchenware. The search personalization and recommendations AI also identifies patterns in consumer behavior, such as clicks, add-to-cart actions, purchases, and other data, to determine individual shopper tastes and preferences.\n\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, emphasized, \"The integration of Google Cloud with Shopify enables brands to easily harness the power of AI. By creating exceptional product discovery experiences, retailers can now help shoppers find exactly what they want in a quicker and more efficient manner.\"\n\nRainbow Shops, an apparel brand with numerous locations across the US and a vast product range, is one of the first retailers to benefit from this integration. David Cost, the Vice President of Ecommerce and Marketing at Rainbow Shops, shared, \"For a retailer our size, it is crucial to work with a commerce platform that provides agility and flexibility across all aspects of our business. Shopify, in partnership with Google Cloud, has allowed us to seamlessly incorporate Google-quality search directly into our online store, resulting in a 48% increase in search volume.\"\n\nCommerce Components by Shopify, which was launched earlier this year, offers a modern and flexible retail stack designed specifically for enterprise businesses. Some notable brands already utilizing Shopify's platform include Mattel, Glossier, JB Hi-Fi, Coty, Steve Madden, Spanx, and Staples.\n\nTo learn more about Commerce Components by Shopify, visit their website.

Exceptional leaders, thinkers, and innovators are crucial to driving these economies, and women play a critical role in this. At Shopify, we are proud to have 53% of our global entrepreneurs being women. It's incredible to think that there are now over 413 million women entrepreneurs worldwide, a number that was once unimaginable.\n\nAlthough women still face challenges in raising venture capital and wage inequality persists, data shows that businesses led by women actually earn more for every dollar invested compared to their male counterparts. This is why we at Shopify actively support and champion women-led businesses every month, not just during Women's History Month.\n\nIn this spirit, we want to introduce you to three remarkable companies led by women who are determined to inspire change in their respective industries and beyond. We will be cheering them on as they make a difference.\n\nOne of these amazing women is Sandra Velasquez, the founder of Nopalera, a beauty brand that celebrates her Mexican culture. She started this brand in 2020 with a bold vision to disrupt the traditionally Euro-centric beauty space and make room for Latin beauty brands. Today, Nopalera is proudly available at major retailers such as Credo Beauty, Nordstrom, and Free People. Velasquez's goal is to showcase the richness and beauty of her culture, proving that it deserves the same recognition and price tags as any other.\n\nAnother inspiring story comes from Kathryn Shah, who discovered her passion for presenting fruits, nuts, and dates as indulgent treats during her travels across the Middle East and India. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age, she realized the importance of clean and healthy food options. This led her to create Spring & Mulberry, a brand that offers delicious and beautiful chocolate bars made with natural ingredients. Shah's goal was to provide a chic and cool alternative that is not only tasty but also good for you.\n\nThese stories highlight the determination and resilience of women entrepreneurs. They demonstrate that with hard work and perseverance, anyone can achieve their dreams. We are proud to support these incredible women and look forward to seeing their brands thrive. END"}

We understand that simply stopping emissions is not enough, as there is still an excessive amount of carbon in the atmosphere. It is clear that no single solution can solve this problem alone. That's why we recognize the need to further develop and scale carbon removal technologies.\n\nSince the launch of our sustainability fund in 2019, Shopify has been actively investing in carbon removal as a way to support and nurture a growing industry. Today, we are thrilled to announce that, in partnership with Stripe, we are purchasing $11 million worth of carbon removal from six new companies: Arbor, Captura, Carbon to Stone, Cella, Crew, and Inplanet. This is an exciting development in our ongoing fight against climate change, and we are inspired by the caliber and rapid growth of these new companies entering the market. Through our purchases, we are providing them with the opportunity to showcase their impact and expand their operations. With these additions, a total of 28 companies are now backed by Shopify.\n\nThese recent purchases are just a part of our commitment to accelerate the market for carbon removal. In 2022, Shopify's sustainability fund made significant progress by adding nine new businesses to our portfolio. Our investments have helped these companies bring their innovative solutions to market and drive widespread adoption. Through our fund activities, we have facilitated over $50 million in capital raising for multiple companies, resulting in a fivefold increase in their employee count. This growth has enabled them to expand their carbon removal capacity by more than 1000 times.\n\nAnother key initiative we launched this year is Frontier, an advanced market commitment (AMC) in partnership with Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability. As founders of Frontier, we have pledged to spend a combined $925 million on carbon removal by 2030. This commitment sends a strong signal to innovators, investors, and project developers that there is a market for carbon removal, and it is crucial for all of us to work together to scale the industry.\n\nIn June, we introduced Shopify Planet, an app that allows our merchants to offset their shipping emissions. Planet calculates the estimated shipping emissions for each order, and merchants have the option to fund carbon removal projects supported by Shopify to neutralize these emissions. Since its launch, over 8,000 Shopify merchants have used Planet to offset shipping emissions on more than six million orders, resulting in over 5,000 tonnes of carbon removal.\n\nWe also understand that supporting carbon removal can be challenging for some individuals and businesses. That's why we recently published \"Buying Carbon Removal, Explained,\" a comprehensive guide that provides assistance to anyone interested in supporting carbon removal but facing obstacles along the way. This guide covers everything from researching suppliers to negotiating carbon removal contracts and addressing concerns from finance teams. We are committed to creating demand for carbon removal, helping new companies prove their impact and scale, and investing millions of dollars each year to drive down future prices.\n\nI had the privilege of speaking about these initiatives at the TED Countdown London session. If you're interested, you can watch my talk at go.ted.com\/stacykauk.\n\nThat's all for now. Don't forget to subscribe to our mailing list for updates from us in 2023.

As I sit down to write this message, I can't help but reflect on the journey we've been on together. It feels like just yesterday that I sat in this very spot, writing the first lines of code that would ultimately become Shopify. What started as a simple idea has grown into something truly remarkable, full of excitement, challenges, triumphs, setbacks, and most importantly, a strong sense of camaraderie.\n\nBeing on this journey with all of you, surrounded by such talented teammates, and tackling difficult tasks head-on is what it's all about. It's what has brought us this far and what will continue to propel us forward. However, I must share some difficult news. Our next phase of growth will involve a reduction in our workforce, resulting in approximately 10% of our team members leaving by the end of the day.\n\nThe majority of the roles affected are in recruiting, support, and sales. Additionally, we'll be eliminating specialized and duplicate positions, as well as some departments that are too removed from our core product development. In a few minutes, you'll receive an email that will clarify if your role has been impacted. If you are affected, you will then have a meeting with your team lead.\n\nI understand that this news is hard for our company to digest, and it will be even harder for those who are leaving today. I want to assure you that I will provide as much information as possible about how we arrived at this decision and what will happen next for those who are departing.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, there was a massive shift in retail towards online platforms due to stay-at-home orders. This resulted in a skyrocketing demand for Shopify. To support our merchants, we abandoned our roadmaps and worked tirelessly to deliver anything and everything that could be helpful. We know for a fact that many businesses survived the pandemic because of our efforts, and that's precisely what our mission is all about.\n\nShopify has always been a company that takes bold strategic risks, driven by the needs of our merchants. This is how we achieve success. Prior to the pandemic, ecommerce growth was steady and predictable. However, faced with the extraordinary circumstances, we made another bet. We believed that the share of dollars flowing through ecommerce rather than physical retail would permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years. While it was impossible to know for certain at the time, we felt that if there was even a chance of this being true, we needed to expand our company accordingly.\n\nUnfortunately, it has become evident that our bet did not pay off as we anticipated. The data now shows that the channel mix is returning to pre-COVID levels. Although ecommerce is still growing steadily, it hasn't made the significant leap we expected. Given the higher market share we have in ecommerce compared to retail, this is a significant matter. Ultimately, the decision to place this bet was mine, and I admit I got it wrong. Now, we must make adjustments.\n\nAs a result, we must bid farewell to some of our valued team members today, and for that, I am deeply sorry. The news of these changes will be challenging for everyone to process. However, please know that we are here to support each one of you during the coming weeks and months. We are offering a generous severance package, which includes 16 weeks of severance pay for those affected today, with an additional week for each year of tenure at Shopify. We will remove any equity cliff and extend medical benefits.\n\nI want to express my sincere gratitude to each one of you for your unwavering dedication to supporting our merchants and our mission of making commerce better for everyone.\n\nThank you,\n\n[Your Name] END"}

That's why, in 2021, we introduced Shopify Markets, a tool designed to eliminate barriers to cross-border selling and empower Shopify merchants to become global leaders effortlessly. Since its launch, over 175,000 merchants worldwide have utilized Markets to successfully expand their international businesses. In the United States alone, Shopify merchants using Markets sell their products in an average of 14 different countries.\n\nUsing Shopify Markets has truly been a game changer for us. It provides us with transparent and easily understandable data that informs us of our global performance. David Wiggins, Head of E-commerce at Walk London, explains, \"This data has revolutionized our decision-making process, allowing us to make strategic marketing choices like improving our shipping service, offering localized payment methods, and introducing new languages tailored to specific markets. All of these efforts contribute to our overall growth strategy.\"\n\nBuilding on the success of Shopify Markets, we are excited to announce the launch of Shopify Markets Pro and Shopify Translate & Adapt. These new additions aim to make cross-border commerce even more accessible and seamless for Shopify merchants who aspire to accelerate their global expansion without adding complexity to their operations.\n\nShopify Markets Pro is a native merchant-of-record solution powered by our partnership with Global-e. It simplifies the process for Shopify merchants to expand their businesses to over 150 countries overnight. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Manages compliance on behalf of the merchant: Compliance with tax and duty regulations can be a complicated process, with variations in every market and constantly changing currencies. This complexity often leads to slow and costly market entry. However, with Shopify's native merchant-of-record solution, all of these obligations are expertly handled for the merchant at scale.\n\n2. Provides affordable express shipping with DHL: Individual merchants often struggle to negotiate affordable international shipping rates, especially for express shipping. With Markets Pro, Shopify negotiates on behalf of the merchants, granting them access to preferred competitive rates. This enables merchants to offer fast shipping with prepaid duties, delighting consumers around the world.\n\n3. Creates a seamless consumer experience: Each market has unique consumer expectations, and creating a localized and seamless customer experience is crucial for successful international selling. Customers want to shop in their local currency, use their preferred payment method, and avoid any surprise duty fees upon delivery. In fact, selling in a local currency has been found to increase gross merchandise value (GMV) from international buyers by 7%. Additionally, enabling local payment methods increases checkout rates by approximately 6%. Markets Pro makes it easier than ever to optimize the consumer experience, addressing complexities such as local currency, payment methods, shipping, and tax and duties on a larger scale.\n\nJake Allain, COO at State & Liberty Clothing Co., shares his positive experience, stating, \"Shopify Markets Pro has simplified and expanded our global expansion strategy without adding any of the complexity we typically face when selling to international customers. Understanding the nuances of global markets can be daunting, but having Shopify manage it for us, using the platform we already rely on to build our business, has allowed us to focus on crafting high-quality products.\"\n\nWhether you're new to international selling or looking to scale your existing global endeavors, the challenges of taxes, duties, pricing, language, and payments can feel overwhelming.

This merchant-of-record solution enables independent brands to rapidly scale their international sales, a feat that would typically be inaccessible. Supported by the Shopify Admin, Markets Pro provides merchants with a unified view of their business, regardless of where they're selling.\n\nTo learn more about how Shopify Markets and Shopify Markets Pro can assist you in expanding your international presence, please visit [link].

Our merchants also experienced significant growth, with sales totaling $175.4 billion on our platform, a 47% increase from 2020.\n\nThis growth is a testament to the increasing popularity of independent businesses and Shopify's position as the go-to choice for entrepreneurs.

When the fires hit on August 8th, the road to Kahului airport was closed, leading to the cancellation of our regular flight to Vancouver that evening. The next day, we were all deeply saddened by the news of the destruction in Lahaina and the ensuing evacuation.\n\nImmediately, our System Operations Control (SOC) team in Toronto, Ontario, sprang into action. They meticulously analyzed our global operations, fleet, and demand requirements to come up with a plan to operate in this rapidly changing environment and get people home. They faced challenges such as the busy summer travel season and the lack of hotel accommodations for our crew due to the devastation.\n\nDespite these obstacles, our team remained determined. We decided to use a wide-body aircraft with onboard rest facilities to double-crew the flights, allowing one crew to rest while the other operated the aircraft. This also enabled us to bring back twice as many passengers on each flight. We knew it was crucial to return passengers to their loved ones as quickly as possible during such a difficult time.\n\nWithin 24 hours, our comprehensive plan was finalized and put into action. We quickly organized a larger Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with 298 seats to accommodate more passengers. This required coordination across all operational branches of Air Canada, including crew scheduling, contract centers, catering, security, and ground handling. We even loaded extra fuel in case facilities in Maui were compromised.\n\nTo ensure maximum flexibility, we assigned extra pilots and sent a maintenance engineer as part of the crew to sign off on the aircraft in Maui. As local authorities advised against visitors coming to Maui, we canceled our outbound flights and instead operated a ferry flight down with no passengers onboard. Our flights back to Toronto were then scheduled as regular flights on the wide-body aircraft, allowing us to bring back as many passengers as possible.\n\nThe situation on the ground in Maui was constantly changing, making it challenging for both our team and passengers. Karen Park, our manager for customer service in Hawaii, worked tirelessly to liaise with local authorities, other airlines, and our ground handling team. She also provided assistance to passengers, despite the difficult circumstances.\n\nWe are proud of our team's dedication and the support we received from all our operational branches. Together, we successfully brought over one thousand Canadians home safely from Maui, even in the face of the largest natural disaster in the state's history. Despite the numerous obstacles and the dynamic nature of the situation, we remained committed to our mission of getting people home as quickly and safely as possible. END"}

The Minister asked the Ombudsperson to look into concerns raised by certain Muslim-led charities and engage with other registered charities led by racialized communities to learn about their experiences with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The report also clarifies the CRA's role in national security.\n\nIn line with our commitment to independence, we took the time to listen to all perspectives, deepen our understanding, examine the facts, and identify areas where the CRA can improve its service to Canadians. To ensure a comprehensive examination, we met with various stakeholders, including charities, experts, CRA employees and executives, lawyers from the Department of Justice Canada, and academics.\n\nAlthough we faced some legislative and administrative obstacles that limited our access to necessary information, we firmly believe that this report highlights opportunities for the CRA to enhance its service to charities. While we were unable to conduct a full examination, we did identify one crucial area for improvement. Recognizing the impact of bias, the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson recommends that the CRA:\n\n1. Develop an unconscious bias training course for employees in the Charities Directorate.\n2. Focus this training on those involved in the audit process.\n3. Make this training mandatory for all employees involved in the audit process, including decision makers.\n\nIt is important to note that the Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson operates independently of the CRA. Canadians can submit complaints to our office if they believe they are not receiving appropriate service from the CRA. Our main objective is to improve the service provided by the CRA to taxpayers and benefit recipients. We accomplish this by reviewing individual service complaints and addressing systemic service issues that affect multiple individuals or specific segments of the population.\n\nAs the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson, we work to assist, advise, and inform the Minister of National Revenue on matters related to CRA services. We specifically ensure that the CRA upholds eight service rights outlined in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our ongoing examinations, please visit our website at [insert website link].

{"prompt":"back in the 1990s , i dropped in on a senior alberta civil servant intending on an informal chit-chat . it pays to maintain positive rapport with frequent contacts . on this occasion , he wasn’t eager to see me . smoke emanated from the official’s desk . only months earlier the provincial government forbade civil servants from smoking in enclosed offices . seeing an ombudsman investigator approaching , he slammed his ashtray and cigarette into his top drawer . when caught , we both laughed . i was relieved our relationship was intact . as an alberta ombudsman investigator , the least i anticipated was professional respect . good relations counted if i was to play my part in fulfilling the ombudsman’s mandate of promoting fair treatment in the public sector . as an independent officer of the legislative assembly , the ombudsman investigates complaints of unfair treatment that impacted someone in the delivery of public services . senior civil servants tended to be male in those days . even in the office of the ombudsman , female investigators were rare , the most common hire being a 50-plus-year-old ex-policeman . hired at 34 years of age , one of my new colleagues warned me that i was too young for job . the reason why investigators tended to be older was because it was important they be perceived as experienced and credible when dealing with a civil service that operated — quite frankly — by the seat of its pants . like now , government required a legislative and policy base to operate , but no one felt restricted to a narrow set of rules . in the “real world , ” people achieved goals by doing what was practical . those most opposed to a structured process at the time may have viewed policy as confining . fortunately , we’ve all evolved since then . in the 1990s , i interviewed two civil servants . i didn’t think their “common-sense” decision was fair . i asked if they had policies . they disappeared to consult with a superior and returned 10 minutes later to reassure me that the department had policies . i asked to see to the policies . back for another consult with the superior . i could see them , i was told , but it would have to wait because the policy book was in calgary . basic concepts escaped many at the time . one regional manager in the social-assistance field had a sign on his wall that read “in this office , ‘no’ is a complete sentence . ” from the perspective of 2022 , i am embarrassed to say i didn’t object . i knew the poster was condescending and conveyed the wrong message to his staff and clients . but i didn’t yet have a conscious awareness of fairness principles that would have given me the vocabulary to object . after 36 years promoting administrative fairness , i can tell you today all decisions are reviewable and “no” can never be a complete sentence . the more important a decision is , the more necessary it is to explain how the outcome was reached based on the facts of the case as they relate to legislation and policy . even formally appointed boards made up of experts can miss the boat on supplying fair reasons . a typical decision concluded “based on the evidence above , the benefit is denied . ” what evidence ? the list of evidence included some that supported the appellant as well as some that supported the government . what did the panel perceive as important and why ? readers can’t be expected to guess . improvement has taken place . hiring practices are more inclusive . creation and adherence to policy is essential practice . in an era of open government , many policies are published online . new hires actually get trained , rather than thrown into the fire to learn as they go . the advance of technology , particularly in the last 15 years , was unavoidable . decisions that used to take days or weeks can sometimes be instantaneous . while a level of automation may seem to be a sensible , convenient evolution , the good must be balanced with the issues arising . no computer program is complete and can exercise discretion . when an albertan is denied service , getting personal advice and review is harder than ever . sometimes template computer responses aren’t enough . ->","completion":" In the 1990s, I had a casual meeting with a senior civil servant in Alberta. It's important to maintain positive relationships with frequent contacts, and on this particular occasion, he didn't seem too thrilled to see me. I noticed smoke coming from his desk, even though just a few months prior, the provincial government had prohibited smoking in enclosed offices for civil servants. Just as an investigator from the ombudsman's office approached, he quickly hid his ashtray and cigarette in his desk drawer. We both found the situation amusing when we got caught. I was relieved that our relationship remained intact.\n\nAs an investigator for the Alberta ombudsman, I expected to be treated professionally and with respect. Building good relationships was crucial for me to fulfill the ombudsman's mission of promoting fair treatment in the public sector. The ombudsman, an independent officer of the legislative assembly, investigates complaints of unfair treatment in the delivery of public services. Back then, senior civil servants were mostly men, and female investigators like me were rare. The most common hire was a retired policeman over the age of 50. When I joined at 34, one of my new colleagues warned me that I was too young for the job. Older investigators were preferred because they were seen as experienced and credible when dealing with a civil service that often operated without strict rules.\n\nEven in the \"real world,\" achieving goals often meant adopting practical approaches rather than strictly following policies. However, things have thankfully changed since then. In the 1990s, I interviewed two civil servants who made decisions that seemed unfair based on common sense. When I asked if they had policies to guide their decisions, they had to consult with a superior. They eventually reassured me that the department did have policies but couldn't show them to me at the time because the policy book was in Calgary. Basic concepts were often overlooked back then. I recall one regional manager in social assistance who had a sign on his wall stating, \"In this office, 'no' is a complete sentence.\" Looking back from 2022, I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't object. I understood that the sign was condescending and sent the wrong message to staff and clients, but I didn't yet have the vocabulary or awareness of fairness principles to speak up.\n\nAfter 36 years of advocating for administrative fairness, I can confidently say that all decisions are subject to review, and a simple \"no\" is never sufficient. The more significant a decision, the more important it is to explain how the outcome was reached based on the facts of the case and relevant legislation and policy. Even expert-led boards can sometimes fail to provide adequate reasons for their decisions. A typical decision might conclude with \"based on the evidence above, the benefit is denied.\" But what evidence exactly? The list of evidence may include some supporting the appellant and others supporting the government. Readers shouldn't be expected to guess what the panel deemed important and why. Thankfully, improvements have been made. Hiring practices are more inclusive, and the creation and adherence to policy are now essential practices. In the era of open government, many policies are published online. New hires receive proper training instead of being thrown into the deep end. The advancement of technology, particularly in the last 15 years, was inevitable. Decisions that used to take days or weeks can now be made instantly. However, we must balance the benefits of automation with the challenges it brings. No computer program can exercise discretion, and it has become harder than ever for Albertans to receive personal advice and review when denied services. Sometimes, template computer responses just aren't enough. END"}

That's why we've introduced our Equality & Inclusion Action Plan in Canada, with the goal of representing the diversity of Canada at every level by 2025. We want to increase indigenous, black, and French representation within our company.\n\nCurrently, we recognize that indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) make up almost 5% of the Canadian population, but none of our P&G Canada employees self-identify as indigenous, and we don't have any employee affinity groups specifically representing them. However, we're taking steps to change that.\n\nIn May 2021, we launched the Indigenous Professional Network (IPN) as part of our Canadian Equality & Inclusion Action Plan. Our mission is to support P&G in fulfilling the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Call to Action #92, which calls on companies to foster respectful relationships, support economic opportunities, build representation, and create an inclusive workplace for indigenous peoples.\n\nSo far, our actions have focused on three key areas: community engagement, employee awareness, and recruiting.\n\nIn terms of community engagement, we're proud to partner with Indigenous Works, a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing indigenous engagement in the Canadian economy. They've been helping us develop our workplace employment and inclusion strategies. We've also donated $100,000 to GlobalMedic, our long-standing partner, to distribute P&G hygiene kits to indigenous communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, we've supported the United for Change Indigenous People's Solidarity Fund with a $200,000 corporate match, benefiting more than 40 indigenous-led charities across Canada.\n\nTo raise employee awareness, we organized a Canada-wide speaker event on National Indigenous People's Day, featuring Dr. Lana Potts, an advocate for indigenous health. We also held a film screening of \"We Were Children\" followed by discussions to shed light on the intergenerational harm caused by the legacy of the residential school system. In December, we published a list of indigenous-owned charities and organizations where employees could donate their time and money.\n\nIn terms of recruiting, we launched the Indigenous Student Internship program nationally, partnering with over 7 campuses to drive awareness and applications. We're proud to say that we've recruited 2 indigenous interns, a first-ever for P&G Canada. Additionally, we've developed a partnership with the University of British Columbia for consultation on job postings and campus recruitment strategies. We were also the spotlight session sponsor for Indspire's \"Soaring Indigenous Youth Empowerment Gathering,\" reaching over 900 high school students and teachers across Canada.\n\nWe're encouraged by the positive response from our employees, with over 150 Canadians attending our events and discussions. Furthermore, we're excited to continue our efforts to create a more inclusive and diverse workplace at P&G Canada, where everyone has equal access to learn, grow, succeed, and thrive. END"}

The ups and downs of inflation, higher interest rates, and the possibility of a recession are testing portfolios in various ways. On top of that, game-changing innovations like artificial intelligence and an increasingly complex sustainability landscape are transforming industries and economies. At the same time, changing trade patterns, geopolitical shifts, and demographic changes are reshaping our world. With all this upheaval, finding a balance between risk and reward won't be easy. But we believe it's crucial for investors to cut through the noise and understand the nuances in order to navigate the consequences of recent economic events on their portfolios.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are also plenty of opportunities for those who embrace change. Companies are restructuring themselves to thrive in this challenging environment, which opens up investment possibilities in both public and private credit, as well as private secondaries. Disruptive technologies, changing demographics, and the push for decarbonization are driving this transformation, creating potential financing opportunities in private equity, private infrastructure, green and social bonds, and thematic equities. By pursuing adaptable active strategies across public and private markets, portfolios can become more resilient and have the potential to deliver strong returns in this era of rapid change.\n\nSucceeding in today's dynamic market environment will require companies and investors to be agile. It will also require access to the right technology, data, and networks to achieve exponential results. To stay ahead, a mix of creativity, courage, and deep market experience gained through previous cycles will be key. In the private equity space, for example, the path to operational value creation may look different now, and general partners will need to stay on top of the evolving market as limited partners become more focused on manager due diligence. Similarly, in commercial real estate, macro forces and trends are reshaping the landscape, creating gaps between buildings that embrace disruption and those that may become obsolete.\n\nArtificial intelligence is a powerful force that has garnered a lot of attention in recent years. While it is still gaining prominence at a slower pace than expected, it has the potential to reshape not only the business world but also global power dynamics. As AI advances, it has the ability to synthesize vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and provide valuable insights for businesses. It could even counteract the structurally higher inflation that we've been seeing. Considering the far-reaching implications of AI is essential for investors.\n\nAs we navigate these changes, the drive towards a sustainable and inclusive economy remains a priority. This transition presents both risks to manage and opportunities to pursue. Decarbonization themes and investment approaches are becoming more complex, sparking important debates about how to achieve long-term affordable, clean, and secure energy. Investors may need a more sophisticated approach to managing climate-related risks.\n\nLastly, inclusive growth and improving people's quality of life is a complex challenge. It requires a comprehensive approach that spans healthcare, education, financial inclusion, and community development.

{"prompt":"in mid-2022 , few outside the artificial intelligence ( ai ) community had heard of a chatbot called chatgpt . however , by january 2023—only two months after its november 2022 release by openai—chatgpt was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users , making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history . 1 this set off a proverbial ai gold rush application developers , venture capital-backed startups , and some of the world’s largest corporations are all now scrambling to assess the possibilities of a world heavily influenced by generative ai tools . 2 while many hedge fund managers are also incorporating ai into their processes , many are more focused on capitalizing on what is widely viewed as a new and more volatile market regime . as of july 2023 , the us federal reserve had raised the federal funds rate at 11 out of the last 12 meetings—including four straight 0 . 75% hikes—marking the fastest and most aggressive pace of rate increases since the early 1980s . 3 with the fed funds rate jumping roughly 500bps in only 16 months ( march 2022 - july 2023 ) , hedge fund managers may also be experiencing a similar strategy-altering evolution of the economic environment . the new and evolving macroeconomic environment plays to the advantage of most hedge fund strategies , and we expect it will lead to materially greater expected returns with similar—and potentially lower—levels of risk over the medium term . a market environment of higher volatility following the global financial crisis ( gfc ) of 2008-2009 , both low inflation and meagre economic growth led to dovish global monetary policies and generous fiscal policies . as a result of easy money and ultra-low interest rates , volatility was dampened in most asset classes . since early 2022 , there has been a material increase in inflation that has led to a mostly coordinated attempt by central banks to remove market liquidity and raise interest rates , which has had the expected effect of increasing volatility in most asset classes . while rates and volatility are certainly higher now than in the decade following the gfc , they are reasonable when measured against longer timeframes . furthermore , despite many economists and market participants believing that the shift to tightening monetary and fiscal policy may ultimately lead to recession , the jobs markets and risk asset performance to date have remained strong . however , despite debate around if and when the economy will have a soft landing or recession , there appears to be market consensus for a prolonged period of elevated macro volatility . 4 for most of the past decade , the hedge fund industry faced headwinds to generate alpha as subdued volatility led to fewer trading opportunities and a near-zero interest rate environment hindered the asset price discovery process . following the tightening of monetary policies , we now have a new macro regime characterized by greater volatility—which should also lead to better investing opportunities for hedge funds . historically , when equity and fixed income volatility has increased , hedge fund alpha generation has also improved this scenario occurred as recently as the second half of 2022 . in the mid-2000s , hedge fund alpha generation was about 5%—similar to the average fed funds rate during the period . hedge fund alpha remained strong during the depths of the gfc and the period immediately following nimble , opportunistic investors were able to find profitable trades in dislocated markets around the globe . it was the long subsequent period of low rates and low volatility that caused and supported an environment in which there was little economic uncertainty , resulting in low dispersion within asset classes from which hedged investors could profit . there are few ways for hedge fund strategies to generate alpha when all securities trade in sync , equity and bond markets trend based on monetary policy , and volatility remains low . ->","completion":" In the middle of 2022, not many people outside the artificial intelligence (AI) community knew about a chatbot called ChatGPT. However, by January 2023, only two months after its release by OpenAI in November 2022, ChatGPT had already reached an impressive milestone of 100 million active users per month. This made it the fastest-growing consumer application in history! As a result, there has been a rush for AI application developers, venture capital-backed startups, and even major corporations to explore the possibilities of a world influenced by generative AI tools.\n\nWhile many hedge fund managers are also incorporating AI into their processes, they are more focused on seizing the opportunities presented by a new and potentially more volatile market environment. In fact, the US Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate at 11 out of the last 12 meetings since July 2023, including four consecutive 0.75% hikes. This marks the fastest and most aggressive pace of rate increases since the early 1980s. With the interest rate jumping roughly 500 basis points in just 16 months (from March 2022 to July 2023), hedge fund managers may also need to adjust their strategies to adapt to this evolving economic landscape.\n\nFortunately, this new macroeconomic environment actually works in favor of most hedge fund strategies. We anticipate that it will lead to significantly higher expected returns with similar, and possibly even lower, levels of risk over the medium term. Following the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009, a market environment characterized by low inflation and limited economic growth resulted in accommodating global monetary policies and generous fiscal policies. As a result, volatility in most asset classes was dampened due to easy money and ultra-low interest rates.\n\nHowever, since early 2022, there has been a notable increase in inflation, prompting central banks to remove market liquidity and raise interest rates in a coordinated effort. As expected, this has caused volatility to rise in most asset classes. While rates and volatility are indeed higher now compared to the decade following the GFC, they are reasonable when analyzed over longer timeframes. Additionally, despite concerns that tightening monetary and fiscal policies may lead to a recession, the job market and risk asset performance have remained strong. Nevertheless, there is a consensus in the market for a prolonged period of elevated macro volatility.\n\nOver the past decade, the hedge fund industry faced challenges in generating alpha due to subdued volatility and a near-zero interest rate environment, which limited trading opportunities and hindered the asset price discovery process. However, with the tightening of monetary policies, we are now in a new macro regime characterized by greater volatility. This, in turn, presents better investment opportunities for hedge funds.\n\nHistorically, when equity and fixed income volatility has increased, hedge fund alpha generation has also improved. This was evident as recently as the second half of 2022. In the mid-2000s, hedge fund alpha generation was around 5%, similar to the average fed funds rate during that period. Hedge fund alpha remained strong during the depths of the GFC and the period immediately following it, as agile and opportunistic investors found profitable trades in disrupted markets worldwide.\n\nHowever, the subsequent prolonged period of low rates and low volatility limited economic uncertainty, resulting in low dispersion within asset classes. This environment made it difficult for hedged investors to profit when all securities traded in sync and equity and bond markets trended based on monetary policy, while volatility remained low.\n\nIn conclusion, the current shift towards greater volatility offers new opportunities for hedge fund strategies to generate alpha. The evolving market conditions, influenced by AI technology and macroeconomic factors, will likely lead to increased returns for hedge funds in the future. END"}
{"prompt":"earlier this year at our formation ’23 conference , we introduced the concept of humanized insurance experiences , whereby insurers prioritize the customer experience and carrier-customer relationship by striving to build trust and loyalty throughout the customer lifetime . humanized experiences happen across every touchpoint of the insured’s journey through the insurance lifecycle . for example , take the hartford creating an intuitive website that makes it fast and easy for aarp members to get a quote and buy auto and home insurance . humanized experiences though aren’t just about the pre-bind activities – it of course can and absolutely should occur during the moment of truth in delivering on the promise of insurance , such as lemonade utilizing ai to process a claim in a record-breaking time of 2 seconds . each insurer will have their own unique approach to creating humanized experiences depending on their business objectives . to achieve humanized experiences though , i would argue that having the right technology stack in place is critical . so in this post , let’s take a look at how continuous updates in saas core systems will make it easier to enable insurers to define the humanized experiences of the future , more so than periodic upgrades . upgrades are a blocker to innovation the industry has long known about the pain of core system upgrades . back in 2020 when duck creek surveyed global insurers , we found that over 53% of respondents were upgrading their it systems only once every 2-3 years . at the same time , core systems have continued to evolve from legacy mainframes and hosted on-prem , to “evergreen” saas evergreen , meaning the systems are comprised of always up-to-date and flexible solutions that can adapt to your business ever-changing requirements . the initial saas core systems have provided a marked improvement over the prior generation of those on-prem systems . with the vendor providing the upgrades , we’ve seen insurers improve their operational efficiency as upgrade projects have gotten faster over time . while these initial saas core systems have delivered new features , insurers have had to wait a long time for them , and this approach has not always been optimal for enabling insurers to design humanized experiences . the good news though is that saas core systems continue to evolve , and they are becoming even more evergreen than before ! how is that ? the paradigm is shifting from faster upgrades to no more upgrades , whereby insurers benefit from continuous updates , which include new features , as well as resolved issues and security patches . as an example , and a quick side note , at duck creek , we refer to our approach of delivering software as “active delivery ” with duck creek claims , we’ve delivered over 250+ new features on a bi-weekly basis ( over 80 software builds ) in the past two years , while ensuring flexible adoption for insurers by way of feature flags . ->","completion":" Earlier this year at our Formation '23 conference, we introduced the idea of creating more personalized and customer-focused insurance experiences. This means that insurers are prioritizing the customer's needs and building trust and loyalty throughout their entire journey with the company. We believe that these humanized experiences should happen at every stage of the insurance process.\n\nFor example, The Hartford has created an intuitive website that makes it quick and easy for AARP members to get a quote and purchase auto and home insurance. But humanized experiences aren't just about what happens before a policy is purchased. It's just as important to deliver on the promise of insurance when a claim needs to be processed.\n\nLemonade, for instance, uses artificial intelligence to process claims in record-breaking time - just 2 seconds! Each insurance company will have its own unique approach to creating these humanized experiences based on their business goals.\n\nHowever, we believe that having the right technology in place is crucial to achieving these humanized experiences. That's why we're focusing on continuous updates to our SaaS core systems, rather than periodic upgrades. The insurance industry has long known the challenges of upgrading core systems. In a survey conducted by Duck Creek, we found that over 53% of insurers were only upgrading their IT systems every 2-3 years.\n\nBut things are changing. Core systems have evolved from legacy mainframes to \"evergreen\" SaaS systems that are always up-to-date and flexible to adapt to changing business requirements. These initial SaaS core systems have already improved operational efficiency, as upgrades are faster than before.\n\nHowever, insurers have often had to wait a long time for new features and improvements. That's why we're excited to say that SaaS core systems are becoming even more evergreen. The paradigm is shifting from faster upgrades to no more upgrades. Instead, insurers will benefit from continuous updates that include new features, issue resolutions, and security patches.\n\nAt Duck Creek, we call this approach \"active delivery.\" For example, with Duck Creek Claims, we have delivered over 250+ new features in the past two years alone, on a bi-weekly basis. We ensure that insurers can adopt these features at their own pace through feature flags, providing them with flexibility and control.\n\nWe believe that by embracing continuous updates in our SaaS core systems, insurers will be able to design and deliver the humanized experiences of the future. This will help enhance trust and loyalty among customers, and ultimately improve the overall insurance experience for everyone involved. END"}

Maybe you upgraded to a fancier, comfier option and left your old one gathering dust in the corner of your bedroom. Or perhaps you're moving and can't take your mattress with you. Whatever the reason, the decision to dispose of your old mattress may seem like a straightforward choice. But hold on a minute - did you know that mattresses are one of the most difficult items to properly get rid of?\n\nThere's a lot that goes into recycling a mattress, and as the experts in junk removal, we're here to help answer any questions you may have. Let's explore why it's so important to recycle your old mattress and the benefits that come from doing so.\n\nDid you know that mattresses take up a lot of space in landfills? In fact, they're one of the bulkiest items, with the average mattress taking up to 40 cubic feet of space. With millions of mattresses being thrown away every year, it's crucial that we find ways to recycle them and keep them out of landfills. When you recycle your mattress, it not only helps with landfill overcrowding but also reduces associated costs like transportation and disposal fees.\n\nA mattress can take anywhere from 80 to 120 years to decompose, which means that a mattress you throw away today will continue to impact future generations. Some materials used to make mattresses can be toxic and pollute soil and groundwater, having a long-lasting impact on the planet. Mattresses are made of various materials like foam, cotton, and synthetic fabrics. When these materials break down over time, they can release toxins into the environment. In landfills, these toxins can seep into the ground and eventually contaminate the soil and water. Recycling and upcycling mattress materials can prevent these toxins from being released and reduce the risk of contamination.\n\nRecycling your old mattress may seem like an extra expense you could do without, but in the long run, it can be a cost-effective choice. Disposing of a mattress in a dump often incurs a fee, and some cities even fine residents who leave their mattresses out for curbside pickup. On the other hand, many recycling centers will take your mattress for free or for a small fee. Additionally, when mattresses are recycled, the materials can be repurposed into new products, saving on resources and energy.\n\nThe good news is that mattresses can be recycled! In fact, more than 80% of mattress materials are recyclable, which means that very little goes to waste. For example, the foam in a mattress can be broken down and used for making new furniture or insulation for homes. The metal springs can be melted down and turned into other items like car parts or even jewelry. The wooden frames can be used as firewood or shredded to produce landscaping mulch. Additionally, fabrics from old mattresses can be shredded and turned into stuffing for pillows or blankets.\n\nAs you choose to recycle your mattress, not only are you keeping waste out of landfills, but you're also contributing to a more sustainable future. The mattress recycling industry is growing, which means there are more job opportunities for people looking for work. Recycling mattresses requires skilled workers who can dismantle and sort the materials. Recycling centers are often staffed by people who take apart old mattresses and separate out any reusable materials for resale or donation. The growth of these facilities means that there will be more demand for workers with these skills, which is good news for the economy. END"}

Smoking is a widespread addictive behavior that unfortunately leads to many adult deaths. In a new study conducted by researchers from the universities of Cambridge and Warwick in the UK, as well as Fudan University in China, brain imaging and behavioral data from over 800 young people were analyzed at the ages of 14, 19, and 23.\n\nThe findings showcased that teenagers who started smoking by the age of 14 had less gray matter in a specific area of the brain associated with decision-making and rule-breaking. Gray matter is the brain tissue responsible for processing information and contains all the organ's neurons. It is worth noting that gray matter growth peaks before adolescence, although brain development continues into adulthood. Researchers believe that low gray matter volume on the left side of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex could be an inheritable indicator for nicotine addiction, which has important implications for prevention and treatment.\n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that smokers also had less gray matter in the right part of the same brain region. Importantly, the decrease in gray matter in the right prefrontal cortex only occurred after individuals started smoking and is associated with the pursuit of sensations. The research team suggests that reduced gray matter in the left frontal lobe may impair cognitive function and lead to impulsive behavior, making individuals more likely to start smoking at a young age. Additionally, once nicotine addiction takes hold, gray matter in the right frontal lobe diminishes, potentially weakening the ability to control smoking due to the impact on hedonic motivation, which relates to seeking and managing pleasure. Excessive loss of gray matter in the right brain was also linked to binge-drinking and marijuana use.\n\nOverall, these findings indicate a disrupted \"neurobehavioral mechanism\" that can prompt early nicotine use and long-term addiction. The study utilized data from the Imagen project and has been published in the journal Nature Communications. Professor Trevor Robbins, co-senior author from Cambridge's Department of Psychology, highlighted the importance of addressing smoking as a leading cause of adult mortality globally. Every year, smoking-related deaths are estimated to reach eight million worldwide, with one in five adult deaths in the US alone attributed to smoking.\n\nThe study's results provide valuable insights into the relationship between reduced gray matter in the left prefrontal cortex, rule-breaking behavior, and early smoking experiences. It is possible that this propensity for breaking rules contributes to violations of anti-smoking norms. Professor Barbara Sahakian, co-author from Cambridge's Department of Psychiatry, emphasized that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in dopamine, the brain's pleasure chemical. Dopamine not only affects rewarding experiences but has long been thought to influence self-control. Less gray matter in this region of the brain could compromise cognitive function, leading to reduced self-control and a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as smoking.\n\nThe study utilized data from multiple European countries, including the UK, Germany, France, and Ireland. By comparing brain imaging data between individuals who started smoking by age 14 and those who did not, the researchers discovered a significant difference in gray matter volume in the left prefrontal cortex. Additionally, those who began smoking by age 19 also exhibited reduced gray matter in this area at age 14, indicating a potential causal influence.\n\nIn summary, this study sheds light on the connection between brain development, gray matter volume, and nicotine addiction. By understanding these underlying mechanisms, we can work towards effective prevention and treatment strategies. It is crucial to address smoking as a global health concern, as its impact on mortality rates is substantial. END"}
{"prompt":"the researchers , from the university of cambridge , found that it may be possible to detect and measure dark energy by studying andromeda , our galactic next-door neighbour that is on a slow-motion collision course with the milky way . since it was first identified in the late 1990s , scientists have used very distant galaxies to study dark energy but have yet to directly detect it . however , the cambridge researchers found that by studying how andromeda and the milky way are moving toward each other given their collective mass , they could place an upper limit on the value of the cosmological constant , which is the simplest model of dark energy . the upper limit they found is five times higher than the value of the cosmological constant that can be detected from the early universe . although the technique is still early in its development , the researchers say that it could be possible to detect dark energy by studying our own cosmic neighbourhood . the results are reported in the astrophysical journal letters . everything we can see in our world and in the skies – from tiny insects to massive galaxies – makes up just five percent of the observable universe . the rest is dark scientists believe that about 27% of the universe is made of dark matter , which holds objects together , while 68% is dark energy , which pushes objects apart . “dark energy is a general name for a family of models you could add to einstein’s theory of gravity , ” said first author dr david benisty from the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics . “the simplest version of this is known as the cosmological constant a constant energy density that pushes galaxies away from each other . ” the cosmological constant was temporarily added by einstein to his theory of general relativity . from the 1930s to the 1990s , the cosmological constant was set at zero , until it was discovered that an unknown force – dark energy – was causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate . there are at least two big problems with dark energy , however we don’t know exactly what it is , and we haven’t directly detected it . since it was first identified , astronomers have developed a variety of methods to detect dark energy , most of which involve studying objects from the early universe and measuring how quickly they are moving away from us . unpacking the effects of dark energy from billions of years ago is not easy since it is a weak force between galaxies , dark energy is easily overcome by the much stronger forces inside galaxies . however , there is one region of the universe that is surprisingly sensitive to dark energy , and it’s in our own cosmic backyard . the andromeda galaxy is the closest to our own milky way , and the two galaxies are on a collision course . as they draw closer , the two galaxies will start to orbit each other – very slowly . a single orbit will take 20 billion years . however , due to the massive gravitational forces , well before a single orbit is complete , about five billion years from now , the two galaxies will start merging and falling into each other . “andromeda is the only galaxy that isn’t running away from us , so by studying its mass and movement , we may be able to make some determinations about the cosmological constant and dark energy , ” said benisty , who is also a research associate at queens’ college . using a series of simulations based on the best available estimates of the mass of both galaxies , benisty and his co-authors – professor anne davis from damtp and professor wyn evans from the institute of astronomy – found that dark energy is affecting how andromeda and the milky way are orbiting each other . ->","completion":" Researchers from the University of Cambridge have discovered a potentially groundbreaking method for detecting and measuring dark energy. By studying the movement of Andromeda, our neighboring galaxy that is slowly approaching the Milky Way, the researchers have found a way to place an upper limit on the value of the cosmological constant, which is a model of dark energy. This upper limit is five times higher than what can be detected from studying distant galaxies. Although this technique is still in the early stages, it shows promise for detecting dark energy in our own cosmic neighborhood. The results of this study have been reported in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nDark energy is a mysterious force that scientists believe makes up 68% of the universe. It is different from dark matter, which holds objects together. Dark energy, on the other hand, pushes objects apart. The simplest model of dark energy is known as the cosmological constant, which was added to Einstein's theory of gravity by him himself. Initially set at zero, it was later discovered that an unknown force, now known as dark energy, was causing the universe to expand at an accelerated rate.\n\nThere are two major challenges when it comes to dark energy. Firstly, we don't know exactly what it is, and secondly, we haven't directly detected it. Astronomers have developed various methods to detect dark energy, most of which involve studying objects from the early universe and measuring their movement away from us. However, due to the weak force of dark energy between galaxies, it is easily overshadowed by the stronger forces within galaxies, making it difficult to study its effects.\n\nHowever, there is one exception. Andromeda, the closest galaxy to the Milky Way, is on a collision course with our galaxy. As the two galaxies draw closer, they will begin to orbit each other at an incredibly slow pace. This orbit will take a staggering 20 billion years to complete. But even before a single orbit is finished, approximately five billion years from now, the two galaxies will start merging and falling into each other.\n\nAndromeda's unique proximity to us makes it an ideal subject for studying dark energy. By analyzing its mass and movement, we may be able to gain valuable insights into the cosmological constant and dark energy. This research has been conducted by Dr. David Benisty from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, along with professors Anne Davis and Wyn Evans. They used simulations based on the best estimates of the galaxies' mass and found evidence that dark energy is indeed affecting how Andromeda and the Milky Way orbit each other.\n\nIn conclusion, this study brings us one step closer to understanding dark energy and its role in the universe.

The capital, Port Vila, lost power, and residents had to evacuate. Sadly, such destruction is becoming more frequent in the South Pacific due to rising temperatures, which fuel intense tropical storms. Vanuatu finds itself on the front lines of the battle against nature. The combination of coastal erosion and extreme weather poses a significant threat to lives and the future of this low-lying archipelago. More than a quarter of the population lives in settlements that could sink into the ocean within decades as sea levels rise due to global warming. Recently, Vanuatu's prime minister, Ishmael Kalsakau, acknowledged the urgency of the situation, stating that the effects of global warming have become an existential crisis for his country.\n\nIt is distressing that wealthier nations continue to release high levels of carbon emissions into the atmosphere while Vanuatu emits very little. This developing country is now teetering on the brink of becoming a victim of the climate crisis. This raises the question: where is the fairness and justice in this situation? Jorge Viñuales, a respected law and environmental policy professor at Cambridge, firmly believes that emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases, despite the known harm it causes worldwide, cannot be lawful. However, international treaties like the Paris Agreement are carefully drafted to remain legally ambiguous. Yet, when viewed through the lens of wider international law, including human rights, the law of the sea, and the UN Charter, nations contributing to climate change are undoubtedly acting unlawfully. Unfortunately, this has never been formally acknowledged.\n\nProf. Viñuales has been working closely with Vanuatu, offering strategic and legal guidance as they seek an \"advisory opinion\" on climate change from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) through the United Nations General Assembly. The ICJ, often referred to as the 'world court,' has issued opinions on a range of critical matters, from genocide to nuclear disarmament. However, it has yet to opine on what could be the defining issue of the 21st century.\n\nAlmost four years ago, Prof. Viñuales received an email from a group of 27 law students in their final year at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. Their class project had quickly gained momentum, receiving support from the Vanuatu government, and a small Pacific law firm based in Guam had taken up the case. Solomon Yeo, the student campaign leader hailing from the climate-threatened Solomon Islands, recognizes the privilege of using his legal knowledge and skills to fight for the right to a dignified life for his people. The initiative to bring climate change before the ICJ had to have strong foundations to succeed, and this encouraged Prof. Viñuales, who spent the entire 2019 Christmas holidays meticulously drafting the question.\n\nEfforts to bring global warming to the ICJ have been made by lawyers, academics, and climate-threatened Pacific nations for decades. Previous attempts by Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Maldives in 2002, and Palau in 2012 were thwarted due to lack of resources and support, both at grassroots and diplomatic levels. However, circumstances have changed in recent years. People are witnessing the undeniable effects of climate change, and frustration is mounting as international conferences (COPs) come and go, with increasingly dire warnings, while major polluting nations hesitate and delay. The fact that an oil executive will preside over COP28 is seen as a betrayal of public trust. \n\nSince around 2015, there has been a surge in climate litigation aimed at pushing courts to take action when political inaction prevails. According to the UN Charter, a simple majority of member states must vote in favor of a resolution for it to reach the ICJ, situated in The Hague and renowned for its impartiality and expertise.

{"prompt":"as a child in the netherlands , the university of cambridge social psychologist discovered that almost all of his mother’s family had been executed by the nazis during the second world war . he became absorbed by the question of how so many people came to support the ideas of someone like adolf hitler , and how they might be taught to resist such influence . while studying psychology at graduate school in the mid-2010s , van der linden came across the work of american researcher william mcguire . in the 1960s , stories of brainwashed prisoners-of-war during the korean war had captured the zeitgeist , and mcguire developed a theory of how such indoctrination might be prevented . he wondered whether exposing soldiers to a weaker form of propaganda might have equipped them to fight off a full attack once they’d been captured . in the same way that army drills prepared them for combat , a pre-exposure to an attack on their beliefs could have prepared them against mind control . it would work , mcguire argued , as a cognitive immunizing agent against propaganda—a vaccine against brainwashing . traditional vaccines protect us by feeding us a weaker dose of pathogen , enabling our bodies’ immune defenses to take note of its appearance so we’re better equipped to fight the real thing when we encounter it . a psychological vaccine works much the same way give the brain a weakened hit of a misinformation-shaped virus , and the next time it encounters it in fully-fledged form , its “mental antibodies” remember it and can launch a defense . van der linden wanted to build on mcguire’s theories and test the idea of psychological inoculation in the real world . his first study looked at how to combat climate change misinformation . at the time , a bogus petition was circulating on facebook claiming there wasn’t enough scientific evidence to conclude that global warming was human-made , and boasting the signatures of 30 , 000 american scientists ( on closer inspection , fake signatories included geri halliwell and the cast of m*a*s*h ) . van der linden and his team took a group of participants and warned them that there were politically motivated actors trying to deceive them—the phony petition in this case . then they gave them a detailed takedown of the claims of the petition they pointed out , for example , geri halliwell’s appearance on the list . when the participants were later exposed to the petition , van der linden and his group found that people knew not to believe it . the approach hinges on the idea that by the time we’ve been exposed to misinformation , it’s too late for debunking and fact-checking to have any meaningful effect , so you have to prepare people in advance—what van der linden calls “prebunking . ” an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . when he published the findings in 2016 , van der linden hadn’t anticipated that his work would be landing in the era of donald trump’s election , fake news , and post-truth attention on his research from the media and governments exploded . everyone wanted to know , how do you scale this up ? van der linden worked with game developers to create an online choose-your-own-adventure game called bad news , where players can try their hand at writing and spreading misinformation . much like a broadly protective vaccine , if you show people the tactics used to spread fake news , it fortifies their inbuilt bullshit detectors . but social media companies were still hesitant to get on board correcting misinformation and being the arbiters of truth is not part of their core business model . then people in china started getting sick with a mysterious flulike illness . the coronavirus pandemic propelled the threat of misinformation to dizzying new heights . van der linden began working with the british government and bodies like the world health organization and the united nations to create a more streamlined version of the game specifically revolving around covid , which they called goviral ! they created more versions , including one for the 2020 us presidential election , and another to prevent extremist recruitment in the middle east . slowly , silicon valley came around . ->","completion":" As a child growing up in the Netherlands, a social psychologist from the University of Cambridge experienced the devastating impact of the Nazi regime on his mother's family during World War II. This led him to question how ordinary people could come to support someone like Adolf Hitler and how they could be taught to resist such influence.\n\nDuring his psychology studies in the mid-2010s, this researcher discovered the work of American researcher William McGuire. McGuire had developed a theory on preventing indoctrination, inspired by stories of brainwashed prisoners-of-war during the Korean War in the 1960s. He wondered if exposing soldiers to a milder form of propaganda before an actual attack could help them resist full indoctrination.\n\nComparing this approach to army drills that prepare soldiers for combat, McGuire proposed that pre-exposure to an attack on one's beliefs could serve as a cognitive immunizing agent against propaganda, similar to a vaccine protecting against pathogens. In this case, a psychological vaccine would involve exposing the brain to a weakened version of misinformation, so that it could recognize and defend against it when encountered in its full form.\n\nBuilding on McGuire's theories, the Cambridge researcher aimed to test the concept of psychological inoculation in real-world scenarios. The first study focused on combating misinformation about climate change. At the time, a false petition was circulating on Facebook, falsely claiming that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support human-made global warming. To combat this, the researcher and their team warned participants about politically motivated actors attempting to deceive them, using the fake petition as an example. They provided a detailed debunking of the petition's claims, including exposing fake signatories like Geri Halliwell and the cast of M*A*S*H. The results showed that participants were able to recognize the misinformation when exposed to it again.\n\nThe premise behind this approach is that debunking and fact-checking become less effective once individuals have already been exposed to misinformation. Therefore, the focus should be on \"prebunking\" or preparing people in advance. Preventing misinformation is more effective than trying to cure its impact later on.\n\nWhen the researcher published their findings in 2016, they didn't anticipate the era of Donald Trump's election, fake news, and a post-truth climate. However, their research gained widespread attention from the media and governments, who were eager to learn how to scale it up.\n\nIn collaboration with game developers, the researcher created an online game called \"Bad News,\" which allowed players to experience writing and spreading misinformation in a choose-your-own-adventure format. Similar to a broadly protective vaccine, the game aimed to strengthen people's ability to detect and resist fake news tactics. Despite this, social media companies remained hesitant to take a strong stance on correcting misinformation, as it was not aligned with their core business model.\n\nHowever, everything changed when the coronavirus pandemic struck and misinformation reached alarming levels. The researcher began working with the British government, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations to create a streamlined version of the game specifically focused on COVID-19, called \"GoViral!\" They also developed versions for the 2020 U.S. presidential election and to prevent extremist recruitment in the Middle East.\n\nGradually, Silicon Valley recognized the importance of tackling misinformation, spurred by the urgency of the pandemic.

{"prompt":"university of cambridge researchers looked at participants of group-based and teacher-led mindfulness courses , conducted in person and offered in community settings . they say the results , published in the journal nature mental health , should encourage uptake of similar teacher-led programmes in workplaces and educational institutions keen to help prevent mental health problems developing in members of their community . “in our previous work it was still not clear whether these mindfulness courses could promote mental health across different community settings , ” said lead researcher , dr julieta galante , who conducted the research while at the university of cambridge . “this study is the highest quality confirmation so far that the in-person mindfulness courses typically offered in the community do actually work for the average person . ” mindfulness in these courses is typically defined as “the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose , in the present moment , and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment” . these courses , formally known as mindfulness-based programmes ( mbps ) , often combine elements of meditation , body awareness and modern psychology , and are designed to help reduce stress , improve wellbeing , and enhance mental and emotional ‘resilience’ . they consist of groups of participants led by mindfulness teachers , who promote reflection and sharing over several one-to-two hour sessions . the body of research into the effectiveness of mbps to date has been mixed . cambridge researchers sought to confirm the effect of mbps on psychological distress ‒ which encompasses disturbing or unpleasant mental or emotional experiences including symptoms of anxiety and depression . they pooled and analysed data from 2 , 371 adults who had taken part in trials to assess the effectiveness of mbps . roughly half the participants had been randomly allocated places on mindfulness programmes that lasted for eight weeks , with a one- to two-and-a-half hour session per week and compared them to those that were not through self-reported questionnaires . the study found that mbps generated a small to moderate reduction in adults’ psychological distress , with 13% more participants seeing a benefit than those who did not attend an mbp . the researchers found that existing psychological distress , age , gender , educational level and a disposition towards mindfulness did not change the effectiveness of mbps . galante said “we’ve confirmed that if adults choose to do a mindfulness course in person , with a teacher and offered in a group setting , this will , on average , be beneficial in terms of helping to reduce their psychological distress which will improve their mental health . however , we are not saying that it should be done by every single person research shows that it just doesn’t work for some people . “we’re also not saying you should absolutely choose a mindfulness class instead of something else you might benefit from , for example a football club – we have no evidence that mindfulness is better than other feel-good practices but if you’re not doing anything , these types of mindfulness courses are certainly among the options that can be helpful . ” the researchers conducted a systematic review to select previous studies for inclusion in their large-scale analysis . they obtained complete but anonymised data from 13 trials representing eight countries . the median age was 34 years-old , while 71% of participants were women . while mindfulness apps are on the rise , researchers remain unsure whether it is the practice of mindfulness that reduces psychological distress , or the fact that courses involve in-person group-work with a teacher present . “apps may be cheaper , but there is nowhere near the same evidence base for their effectiveness , ” said galante . “some apps may say they are evidenced based , but they are often referring to trials that are in-person with a teacher and a group . ” the effectiveness of smartphone apps , as well as what happens when people continue to practice mindfulness meditation by themselves , will be investigated by galante , who has recently taken up a new position as deputy director of the contemplative studies centre , at the university of melbourne . ->","completion":" Researchers from the University of Cambridge have conducted a study on the effectiveness of group-based and teacher-led mindfulness courses offered in community settings. The results of this study, published in the journal Nature Mental Health, suggest that similar teacher-led programs should be adopted in workplaces and educational institutions to prevent the development of mental health problems in their communities. Lead researcher Dr. Julieta Galante, who conducted the research while at the University of Cambridge, explains that previous research did not clarify whether mindfulness courses could promote mental health in different community settings. However, this study provides the highest quality confirmation to date that in-person mindfulness courses offered in the community do work for the average person.\n\nMindfulness courses typically focus on paying attention to the present moment in a nonjudgmental way. These courses, also known as mindfulness-based programs (MBPs), combine meditation, body awareness, and modern psychology techniques to reduce stress, improve wellbeing, and enhance mental and emotional resilience. Led by mindfulness teachers, these programs involve group sessions that promote reflection and sharing.\n\nThe effectiveness of MBPs has been a topic of mixed research findings. The Cambridge researchers aimed to confirm their effect on psychological distress, which includes symptoms of anxiety and depression. They analyzed data from 2,371 adults who had participated in trials to assess the effectiveness of MBPs. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to mindfulness programs that lasted for eight weeks, with weekly sessions lasting one to two and a half hours, while the other half did not attend any mindfulness program. The study found that MBPs led to a small to moderate reduction in psychological distress, with 13% more participants benefiting from the program compared to those who did not attend.\n\nThe researchers discovered that factors such as existing psychological distress, age, gender, educational level, and an individual's disposition towards mindfulness did not affect the effectiveness of MBPs. Dr. Galante states that attending an in-person mindfulness course with a teacher in a group setting can be beneficial in reducing psychological distress and improving mental health. However, she also emphasizes that mindfulness courses may not work for everyone and that other activities, such as joining a football club, can also have positive effects on mental wellbeing.\n\nTo conduct their study, the researchers reviewed previous studies from eight countries and obtained anonymized data from 13 trials. The participants had a median age of 34 years, with 71% of them being women. While mindfulness apps are becoming popular, it is unclear whether the practice of mindfulness itself or the in-person group work with a teacher present is what reduces psychological distress. Dr. Galante cautions that although apps may be cheaper, there is not enough evidence to support their effectiveness compared to in-person mindfulness courses.\n\nDr. Galante plans to further investigate the effectiveness of smartphone apps for mindfulness and the benefits of practicing mindfulness meditation independently. As the new Deputy Director of the Contemplative Studies Centre at the University of Melbourne, she will continue exploring these areas. END"}

Dame Theresa Marteau, a renowned public health expert at the University of Cambridge, believes that neglecting evidence is a surefire way to create ineffective policies. She argues in the journal Science and Public Policy that this neglect arises from incentive structures that push politicians to set ambitious policy goals without incentivizing the implementation of necessary measures. It is also influenced by conflicting political ideologies and interests that clash with effective policies. However, Professor Marteau proposes two changes that can help mitigate these issues: involving citizens more in policymaking to prioritize their interests and establishing legally binding systems to hold politicians accountable at all stages of policymaking.\n\nRecent UK governments have set ambitious goals to improve the nation's health and address climate change. These goals include reducing childhood obesity by 2030, eliminating smoking by 2030, closing the gap in healthy life expectancy by 2030, and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Unfortunately, Professor Marteau, who directs the Behavior and Health Research Unit at Cambridge, states that none of these ambitions are currently on track. While scientific evidence is just one source of information for policymakers, neglecting it is a certain path to unsuccessful policymaking. According to predictions, childhood obesity is predicted to double by 2030 instead of being halved. Smoking eradication is expected to happen after 2050, missing the 2030 target. By 2030, the gap in healthy life expectancy between different areas is projected to narrow, but by 2035, it is estimated to increase by five years. Additionally, the UK is likely to miss its key carbon emissions target by a significant margin.\n\nAchieving each of these ambitions requires sustained behavior change across all socio-economic groups, including our dietary choices, drinking habits, smoking behaviors, and transportation methods. Extensive research demonstrates that this type of change is challenging and necessitates multiple interventions that modify environments and systems to discourage unhealthy and unsustainable behaviors. Professor Marteau highlights that the neglect of evidence, particularly in achieving sustained behavior change across populations, is a major reason why these policy ambitions are falling off track. The policies designed to achieve these goals are based on interventions that cannot bring about the required changes.\n\nPart of the problem lies in the incentive structures for politicians, which encourage them to set ambitious policy goals as a way to fulfill election promises and gain positive publicity. However, these structures also discourage the necessary policies to achieve those goals. Fear of electoral damage plays a role in this issue. For example, policies such as taxes on tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy food, and carbon emissions are highly effective in improving public health and mitigating climate change. However, they are unpopular with the public, leading politicians to be reluctant to implement them. Furthermore, political interests and ideologies may be at odds with such policies. The ideology of neoliberalism, for instance, promotes limited government intervention in the economy and public policy, emphasizing individual responsibility for health, wealth, and happiness. This perspective often portrays government intervention as excessive. In addition, certain industries advocate for personal responsibility to dissuade politicians from adopting effective policies that conflict with their interests. These industries may cast doubt on the effectiveness of policies that would impact their sales and lobby governments to maintain the status quo.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing major issues in the UK requires policymakers to prioritize and incorporate existing evidence into their decision-making processes. By involving citizens more in policymaking and establishing legally binding systems to ensure accountability, we can overcome the obstacles posed by incentives and conflicting interests. It is crucial to acknowledge that neglecting evidence hampers progress and that effective policies are essential for achieving our goals regarding public health and climate change. END"}

In 2015, we joined all United Nations member states in adopting 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). We also pledged to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% compared to 2005 levels by 2030, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 as part of the Paris Agreement. However, we have faced challenges in translating these commitments into action.\n\nAccording to a recent UN report, Canada is ranked 29th out of 163 member states in terms of progress towards achieving the SDGs. Achieving our net-zero target is particularly ambitious considering our historical emissions. While emissions have stabilized in recent years due to technological advancements and slowed industry growth, reducing emissions across the board has proven to be difficult. Meeting our goals will require substantial investments and advancements in technology.\n\nAt BDC, we believe we have a crucial role to play in helping Canada meet its environmental sustainability objectives. We are committed to supporting entrepreneurs in building more sustainable businesses and aim to achieve net-zero emissions in our own operations by 2025. We also recognize the importance of supporting the development and commercialization of new technologies in the market. Our future depends on it, and we want to be a catalyst for bringing in capital and supporting the growth of the sector amidst the global transformation underway.\n\nUnfortunately, Canadian sustainability companies are currently underfunded compared to their global peers. However, BDC has a long history of investing in the cleantech space. We launched our first cleantech fund in 2001, followed by two additional funds. In 2018, we established a dedicated cleantech investment team, managing a $600-million cleantech fund that has invested in 50 impactful cleantech companies. We have recently launched the $400-million Climate Tech Fund II, addressing the chronic lack of private risk capital in Canada's climate tech industry. Since 2018, our commitment to cleantech investing totals $1 billion, making us one of the largest and most active investors in Canada.\n\nDespite these efforts, there remains a funding gap for companies driving the transition to a more sustainable economy. Currently, only 5% of Canadian venture capital investments support environmental sustainability companies, compared to 14% globally in 2021. US cleantech firms raise on average three times more venture capital investment than Canadian firms. The Canadian government estimates that reaching net-zero by 2050 will require significant investments ranging from $60 billion to $140 billion per year on average.\n\nTo address this funding gap and further support sustainability-enhancing technologies, we are launching a new Sustainability Venture Fund. This $150-million fund will focus on software and hardware-enabled software businesses that have capital- and asset-light models. The goal is to invest in companies developing technology that can indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Sustainability Venture Fund complements our existing Climate Tech Fund II, which focuses on capital-intensive and asset-heavy companies.\n\nBy launching this new fund, we aim to bridge the funding gap and support innovative technologies that will help Canada achieve its sustainability goals. Together, with the support of entrepreneurs and the investment community, we can create a more sustainable future for all. END"}

This represents an increase of over $11 billion since 2007, or nearly 12% in per-person costs. These findings come from the Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms (CSUCH) 2007-2020 report, which was released today by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) in partnership with the University of Victoria's Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR).\n\nOne of the key findings is that lost productivity alone accounted for $22.4 billion of the total costs in 2020, equivalent to $589 per person. This includes the value of work lost due to premature deaths and both long- and short-term disability. Dr. Adam Sherk, a scientist at CISUR and a researcher for the study, emphasizes that substance use is not solely a healthcare issue. He suggests that employers can support their employees by implementing supportive substance use policies and investing in prevention, harm reduction, and treatment programs.\n\nThe report categorizes substance use costs into four key areas. In addition to lost productivity (45.6% of total costs), healthcare costs amounted to $13.4 billion (27.4%). Criminal justice costs were $10 billion (20.3%), while other direct costs contributed $3.3 billion (6.7%). These figures highlight how substance use issues permeate various aspects of our daily lives and emphasize the need for solutions to address them.\n\nOther noteworthy findings from the report include:\n\n1. Alcohol accounted for just over 40% of the total costs at $19.7 billion.\n2. The costs of alcohol and tobacco use have diverged over time, with alcohol use costs increasing by 21% and per-person costs of tobacco use declining by 20%.\n3. Opioid use cost $7.1 billion in 2020, the highest of any year examined. The majority of these costs (nearly 75%) were related to lost productivity and premature deaths caused by opioid use.\n4. The per-person cost of substance use increased by 11.8%, from $1,154 in 2007 to $1,291 in 2020.\n5. The per-person costs of opioids and stimulants saw the highest increase among all substances since 2007, reflecting the increasingly toxic unregulated drug supply and the associated harms.\n6. The per-person cost of cannabis decreased by 9.1% between 2018 and 2020 following its legalization for recreational use. This decrease is primarily due to reduced criminal justice costs.\n\nEmily Biggar, a CCSA research and policy analyst and researcher on the project, notes that there were nearly 74,000 deaths due to substance use in 2020, averaging nearly 200 lives lost each day. Alcohol and tobacco alone accounted for over 85% of these deaths. She emphasizes that these estimates demonstrate how substance use not only affects healthcare and the criminal justice system but also hinders people's ability to work and contribute to the economy. Initiatives targeting prevention, harm reduction, and treatment are crucial to improving the health and productivity of Canadians.\n\nThis report is the third update in the Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms project, following releases in 2018 and 2020. CCSA and CISUR developed the CSUCH report to gain a better understanding of the economic costs and harms associated with substance use in Canada. These regularly updated estimates can guide the development of relevant public policies, initiatives to address substance use harms, identification of information gaps, research needs, refinements to national data reporting systems, and ultimately, changes in policy and societal responses to substance use.

However, it's important to note that the more you drink, the higher your risk of developing seven types of cancer, most types of cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and experiencing violence. To prioritize your health, it is advised not to have more than 2 drinks per day on any occasion. In summary, when it comes to alcohol and your well-being, less is better.\n\nThe new guidance replaces the 2011 low-risk alcohol drinking guidelines and aims to support individuals in making well-informed decisions about their health. It meets people where they are and encourages them to assess their current drinking habits. To help illustrate the risks, the guidance provides a continuum of risk associated with alcohol consumption, allowing individuals to determine where they feel comfortable on that scale. Essentially, the more you consume, the higher your risk.\n\nThe report suggests that 1.1–2 standard drinks per week pose a low risk, 3–6 standard drinks per week represent a moderate risk, and 7 or more standard drinks per week indicate an increasingly high risk. Regardless of where you fall on this continuum, it is important to remember that less is better for your health. If you do choose to consume alcohol, it is recommended not to exceed 2 drinks in a day.\n\nFurthermore, if you are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant, it is crucial to note that there is no known safe amount of alcohol during this time.\n\nAlexander Caudarella, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA), emphasized the significance of providing this information to the public. He stated that the concept of a continuum of risk empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption. As a family physician specializing in substance use, Caudarella explained that every drink has an impact and that it is never too late to make positive changes. Even small reductions in alcohol use can have beneficial effects on one's health. Health professionals can now better assess an individual's risk and work collaboratively with their patients to improve their overall well-being.\n\nAndrea Seale, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Cancer Society, also emphasized the importance of raising awareness about the serious health risks associated with alcohol consumption, particularly the increased risk of multiple types of cancer. Many Canadians are unaware of this connection and do not realize that they are consuming unsafe amounts of alcohol. This guidance clarifies that reducing alcohol intake can significantly lower the risk of cancer.\n\nThe new guidance was developed over a two-year research project led by the CCSA. It involved analyzing nearly 6,000 peer-reviewed studies and incorporating insights from a panel of 23 scientists representing 16 organizations. The guidance also took into account the perspectives of the public and stakeholders through focus groups and three consultations. The most recent public consultation received close to 1,000 survey submissions, all of which were thoroughly evaluated to ensure that the guidance is clear and practical for various users, including physicians, counselors, community workers, policymakers, and the public.

During this important week, the MHCC emphasizes the need for significant investments in our mental health system. It is crucial that we address the needs and realities of individuals who have lived experiences with mental health problems and illnesses in 2022.\n\nBack in 2012, the MHCC's Mental Health Strategy for Canada set a spending target of 7 to 9 percent of all healthcare funding to be allocated towards mental health. However, it is important to note that this target is relatively modest for the current year of 2022. Over the past decade, especially with the impact of a global pandemic, that percentage needs to be adjusted accordingly. We should take into account the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the OECD, which urge high-income countries like Canada to increase their spending on mental health care. Additionally, we must listen to the voices of individuals living with mental illnesses, as they provide valuable insights into their own experiences and needs.\n\nRecent polling indicates that one in three people living in Canada reported moderate to severe mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Financial concerns, pandemic-related stress, feelings of isolation, and challenges within our healthcare system are some of the most pressing issues faced by individuals with mental illnesses. Age, gender, 2SLGBTQ+ identity, income, and employment status are the strongest predictors of mental health and substance use concerns. Shockingly, 60 percent of 2SLGBTQ+ youth reported moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms, while approximately 40 percent reported symptoms of depression.\n\nAlthough it can be challenging to connect with statistics, it is essential that we remember the individuals behind these numbers. We must also prioritize the well-being of those who provide care for us. The MHCC has recently published a report on the moral distress and mental health concerns experienced by healthcare workers. Alarmingly, we discovered that only 60 percent of healthcare workers felt confident in the care they were able to provide their patients. While it is not surprising that our healthcare system is under strain, we need to be mindful of the impact this has on accessibility and the quality of services for individuals seeking help for mental illnesses.\n\nFinancial concerns and inflation are significant stressors for many individuals across Canada. Our own polling confirms that finances are one of the top stressors for people living with mental illnesses. The evidence is clear: mental health needs have increased, and funding must catch up accordingly. Let's move beyond awareness and take action during this Mental Illness Awareness Week by increasing investments in our mental health system.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMichel Rodrigue\nPresident and CEO END"}

The study sheds light on the increased stress levels experienced by health-care workers both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Mental Health Commission of Canada, the report, developed in collaboration with the Centre for Studies in Primary Care at Queen's University and HEC Montréal's Healthcare Management Hub, reveals some concerning statistics. It shows that 40% of health-care workers are experiencing burnout, 50% are considering leaving the profession, and only 60% are satisfied with the quality of care they provide.\n\nThe findings suggest that higher levels of moral distress are linked to increased burnout, while practicing self-care is associated with lower levels of burnout. It's important to note that while the pandemic exacerbated staff shortages, this issue already existed prior to COVID-19.\n\nHowever, there is a positive aspect to this research as well. Respondents have noticed a decrease in the stigma surrounding mental health and an increase in support from their peers when discussing personal struggles. Health-care workers have also provided valuable suggestions on how we can better support their psychological well-being and protect them from moral distress.\n\nThese suggestions include prioritizing psychological health and safety in the workplace through advocacy, strategy, and action. It is crucial to ensure health-care workers have sufficient time off and advocate for sustained resources, both human and financial. Implementing appropriate operational policies and procedures, such as debriefing sessions after significant events, can provide the necessary support. Additionally, updating health human resource strategies and fostering an ethical work climate will go a long way in promoting psychological self-care and reducing moral distress.\n\nDr. Colleen Grady from Queen's University emphasizes that health-care workers are resilient and dedicated professionals, but many are currently at their breaking point. They deserve top priority and support from everyone in a position to make change.\n\nThe research involved respondents from various health-care professions, including nurses (31%), social workers (12%), and personal support workers (11%). The majority of respondents worked in hospitals, home and community care, and long-term care facilities. The study surveyed a total of 982 health-care workers across Canada and collected qualitative data from 30 interview participants.\n\nDr. Denis Chênevert from HEC Montréal's Healthcare Management Hub highlights the importance of promoting psychological self-care and reducing moral distress to prevent exhaustion and turnover while improving the quality of care. Proactive steps, such as involving employees in decision-making processes and fostering transparency and effective communication, are essential in creating an ethical work climate and increasing trust in health-care organizations' leadership.\n\nLastly, Michel Rodrigue, President and CEO of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, expresses gratitude to the health-care workers who contributed to this significant research. It is now evident that prioritizing the well-being of our health-care workforce is an essential task that policymakers at all levels can no longer ignore. It is crucial to take care of those who take care of us when we are most vulnerable, as the pandemic has made abundantly clear. END"}

This has important implications for different use cases and highlights the critical role of sustainability in the potential growth of networks. \n\nWhen we think of the metaverse, we often imagine gamers, social networking, and interactive experiences. However, recent research conducted by EY and Nokia reveals that the metaverse is already a part of today's business landscape. Only 2% of respondents view the metaverse as a passing trend, and it is already contributing to solving pressing environmental and social issues. \n\nSustainability is ranked as the top benefit for industrial and enterprise metaverse use cases, both for companies in the planning stage (41%) and for those that have already implemented metaverse use cases (51%). How exactly is the metaverse helping businesses achieve their sustainability goals?\n\nSustainability is an integral part of businesses' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies. Companies measure and report on various environmental and social factors to demonstrate their progress towards achieving net-zero emissions and promoting equal opportunities. These sustainability reports are publicly available for shareholders, investors, governments, and customers to track the company's ESG goals and accomplishments.\n\nThe metaverse intersects with these sustainability goals because many of the digital technologies that are essential to the metaverse enable more sustainable business operations. Advanced connectivity, such as 5G private wireless, as well as cloud computing, smart sensors, AI, and machine learning, can all contribute to reducing energy consumption. Augmented\/extended\/virtual reality and autonomous robots or drones can increase productivity and efficiency by substituting physical journeys and processes with virtual ones. By reducing energy consumption, companies not only save on operating costs but also contribute to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are a leading cause of global warming.\n\nFrom a social perspective, co-development platforms, digital twin technology, and the aforementioned AR, XR, and VR tools facilitate equal participation of experts in business operations. These virtual tools support goals of equal opportunity regardless of gender, age, education, or location. Digital and virtual access can be scaled in a way that physical access cannot, allowing more people to access training, skills development, and expert knowledge. For example, during the pandemic, Lufthansa developed a virtual table inspection of engine parts using 5G private wireless connectivity. Real-time high-resolution video streaming enabled colleagues from different locations to inspect and make joint decisions about components, ensuring smooth operations despite travel restrictions.\n\nWhich metaverse use cases will deliver the greatest sustainability benefits? The EY-Nokia study focuses on four industry sectors: automotive, industrial goods and manufacturing, transportation, supply chain and logistics, and power and utilities. It also examines four areas of the business value chain and maps them to 12 metaverse use cases. Sustainability is identified as one of the top three business benefits in seven of these use cases. In fact, in three use cases, more than 60% of respondents ranked sustainability as the top benefit. END"}

It simply cannot afford to go down. Today, we want to discuss some ways to modernize the network while ensuring resilience and security. \n\nMission-critical networks are the foundation of infrastructure that supports the essential functions and services of various organizations, from hospitals and first responders to power grids and air traffic control. The data and applications on these networks demand the highest level of uptime, performance, and security. Any degradation or outage could have significant, even life-threatening, consequences. \n\nWhile many mission-critical organizations are hesitant to change what's already working \"well enough,\" it is important to understand that well enough will not be sufficient in the digital era. Other sectors and segments of society are embracing industry 4.0 digitalization, which brings increased efficiency, productivity, savings, safety, and sustainability. Those organizations that do not catch up may face challenges and increased operating and support costs. \n\nHowever, being a mission-critical operation shouldn't automatically exclude an organization from experiencing the significant benefits of industry 4.0 digitalization. The best way to modernize and transition to more digitalized and connected business models while ensuring resilience and security is by leveraging the capabilities of modern networks. \n\nToday's fixed and mobile networks come with built-in technologies that maximize uptime, prevent failures, and contain security threats. \"Fixed\" networks based on IP and optical technologies have well-established capabilities to ensure reliability, resiliency, and security while delivering the high-speed, low-latency performance required for industry 4.0 applications. Network operators can enhance IP networking with proven multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) technology for fast, secure, scalable, and bandwidth-efficient network services. \n\nThese networks also offer a wide range of powerful, integrated security features that protect data and ensure regulatory compliance. They provide built-in redundancy, so if one route fails, data can still be moved to another, ensuring it reaches its destination. Integrated alerts help resolve issues with minimal downtime. Fiber optics, with their high capacity, resilience, and secure transmission foundation, are ideal for connected industry 4.0 infrastructure, including robotics and safety mechanisms in hazardous environments. \n\nLooking at the energy sector as an example, mission-critical operations can greatly benefit from industry 4.0 technologies.

It's amazing to see how far we've come, but did you also know that it's estimated to take another 132 years to achieve full gender equality? That's a long time, and we can't wait that long to close the gender gap.\n\nImagine you're starting your own travel business, and you want to understand what your customers really want. Your friend John offers to help by doing some market research. After two weeks, he comes back with some interesting findings - there's a huge demand for physically demanding adventure holidays. But wait, you realize that John only spoke to his male friends at the rugby and golf club. He didn't even talk to your female friend Jane, who could have provided valuable insights. Would you base your business decisions solely on information from one specific group? Of course not! It wouldn't make sense to rely on such limited perspectives.\n\nUnfortunately, this is exactly what many businesses and governments do every day. Our society and businesses are still predominantly male-dominated and built around a standard that favors men's attributes. This can lead to situations where women are at a disadvantage, like in car accidents. Even though women statistically have lower accident rates, they are 50% more likely to die in a crash because safety measures are often designed with men in mind. It's shocking to think that female crash test dummies were only introduced in 2011!\n\nThese imbalances and biases make it more challenging for women to thrive. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index measures progress towards gender equality in various areas, including economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment. While progress is being made, it's projected to take another 132 years to achieve full gender parity. That's why it's crucial for us to take action now.\n\nOne area where gender inequality persists is in pay. Despite equal pay laws, women are still paid less than equally qualified male colleagues doing the same job. In the US, the average gender pay gap is 10%, while it's 13% in the EU and 15% in India. This is partly due to the underrepresentation of women in senior leadership positions and the fact that many women also do unpaid work at home, such as caring for family members. We need to recognize and value all types of work, whether paid or unpaid.\n\nGender equality isn't just about fairness and justice; it also brings significant socioeconomic benefits. Countries with greater gender equality tend to be happier and have higher GDP per capita. Increasing women's presence in the workforce can lead to economic diversification, income equality, and the introduction of diverse skills. Studies have shown that having more women in senior management or on corporate boards can even enhance profitability.\n\nWith all these benefits in mind, it's hard to justify inaction on gender equality. We can't afford to wait another 132 years to achieve full parity. It's time for all of us, as individuals, businesses, and communities, to take meaningful steps towards gender equality. Together, we can create a fair and equitable society, a more sustainable future, and reap the rewards of a better-performing economy. END"}

These cables, which are as thin as a human hair, form the backbone of the internet and enable us to transmit millions of text, audio, and video communications at lightning speed. Unfortunately, when this network experiences an unexpected outage, it causes a chain reaction of costly and intricate measures to quickly restore service and repair the damage.\n\nHowever, Mikael Mazur, a researcher at Nokia Bell Labs, is working to prevent this scenario from occurring. In a recent field trial, Mazur demonstrated how communication fibers can also function as environmental sensors, providing an early detection system for network failure. The real-time coherent transceiver prototype, deployed in Mazur's home country of Sweden, can detect vibrations and distortions in the fiber. This technology can be used for continuous monitoring over a 524-km live network aerial fiber, which aims to create a more versatile and robust network.\n\nThe implications of this technology extend far beyond the realm of telecom. It could also be used for ecological monitoring, helping us measure climate change through temperature shifts and ocean current swells, and even detecting earthquakes. Mazur will present these findings at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference in San Diego, California, which is the most prestigious gathering for the optical research community.\n\nMazur's goal is to extract environmental information from the real-time digital signal processing engine. He believes that the best way to sense what is happening in the network is to use the network itself. In other words, Mazur is working to combine the two primary functions of fiber optics, communication, and sensing. By incorporating sensing capabilities into existing communication cables, we can create a self-monitoring system similar to the fibers used in bridges, buildings, and other critical infrastructure. These fibers, known as \"distributed sensing,\" can provide early warnings of potential issues caused by extreme weather conditions and external factors. Stretching fibers can alert engineers to take proactive measures to prevent breaks or reroute data traffic to avoid outages.\n\nWhile some of this technology already exists in submarine cables, Mazur's aerial cable, deployed in harsh conditions between the Swedish cities of Gothenburg and Karlstad, is believed to be the first to be wrapped around high-voltage power cables suspended from outdoor poles. This design allows for sensing functionality that is compatible with coherent optical transceiver architectures. This is particularly important as we deploy a significant amount of fiber to the grid. By knowing in advance that a link will go down, we can ensure it does not affect the rest of the network.\n\nThis dual function of fiber optics offers an alternative to expensive, specifically designed fiber-sensing devices. It also provides vendors with a competitive advantage at a time when improving speed performance has become increasingly challenging.\n\nIn the world of optical fibers, we are rapidly approaching the Shannon limit, which is the maximum amount of error-free information that can be transmitted through any communication channel. Claude Shannon, a renowned researcher at Bell Labs, named this theoretical boundary. Since increasing speed per channel has become so difficult, Mazur believes that we need to improve fiber optics in other ways. Sensing is one such approach that can enhance their versatility.\n\nUsing multiple spatial channels with a fiber can not only increase capacities but also enable novel sensing methods. Beyond protecting the network from damage or sabotage, this new function also offers benefits beyond telecommunications, particularly in environmental monitoring such as wind, temperature, and currents. In areas prone to earthquakes, there are usually advanced seismic instruments in place. However, in other regions like the deep oceans, these sensing capabilities can be vital in providing warnings for storms, earthquakes, and tsunamis.\n\nFrom Nokia's perspective, their primary interest is to protect the network, ensuring reliability and robustness.

{"prompt":"this nokia bell labs researcher says fiber optics can protect the network - and sense the world 3 march 2023 our globe is hyper-connected by an elaborate network of high-capacity fiber optic cables . these strands of fiber , each about the dimension of a human hair , make up the backbone of the internet and allow us to transmit millions of text , audio and video communications at the speed of light . when this network suffers an outage without warning it sets off a cascading series of costly and complicated actions to quickly restore service and repair the engineering damage . mikael mazur is trying to prevent that scenario from happening . the nokia bell labs researcher’s recent field trial demonstrates how communication fibers can also act as environmental sensors that provide an early detection system for network failure . the real-time coherent transceiver prototype deployed in mazur’s native sweden can detect vibrations and distortions in the fiber . it can be used for continuous sensing over a 524-km live network aerial fiber that looks to usher in an era of a more versatile and robust network . the technology could also have potentially far-reaching implications beyond the realm of telecom , providing ecological monitoring that would be helpful in measuring climate change in terms of temperature shifts and ocean current swells , and could even detect earthquakes . it is these findings that mazur will present next week ( march 5-9 ) in san diego , california at the optical fiber communication conference , the most prestigious gathering of the optical research community . “what i do is figure out how to extract environmental information from the real-time digital signal processing engine , mazur explained . “the best way to sense what is going on in the network is to use the network itself . ” in other words , mazur is seeking to “marry” the two primary functions of fiber optics that have generally been distinct from each other communications and sensing . fibers to the rescue fibers are incredibly good vibration sensors so by incorporating this capability into existing communication cables it offers the potential for a self-monitoring system , like the fibers that exist in bridges , buildings and other critical infrastructure . these offer what is called “distributed sensing” that can warn of pending problems from extreme weather conditions and other external factors . when the fibers stretch , it helps tell engineers to be proactive in preventing a break or to reroute data traffic to avert an outage . some of this technology already exists in the vast submarine cable system . but mazur’s 524-km aerial cable deployed in harsher conditions last june between the swedish cities of gothenburg and karlstad is believed to be the first one to be wrapped around high-voltage power cables suspended from outdoor poles . “we are trying to design sensing functionality that is compatible with coherent optical transceiver architectures , ” mazur said . “this is very important because we deploy so much fiber to the grid . so , if you know ahead of time that a link is going down , you can have it go down without affecting your network . ” this dual purpose provides a potential alternative to purchasing specifically designed , yet extremely expensive , fiber-sensing devices and could offer vendors a competitive advantage at a time when improving speed performance has become increasingly more difficult . pushing the boundaries of science there is a fundamental limit to the quantity of error-free information that can be transmitted over any communication channel . it’s known as the shannon limit – named after famed bell labs researcher and father of information theory claude shannon . in optical fibers , we’re quickly approaching that theoretical boundary . since boosting the speed per channel has become so challenging , mazur says there is a need to improve fiber optics in other ways . sensing is just one such way to make them more versatile . “using multiple spatial channels with a fiber could lead to both higher capacities and novel sensing approaches , ” explained mazur . beyond protecting the network from damage or sabotage , this new function also offers benefits beyond telecom , particularly in environmental monitoring of wind , temperature , currents and more . in earthquake-prone areas of the globe , there are typically more sophisticated seismic instruments in place . but elsewhere , in the deep oceans for example , these sensing capabilities can prove helpful in providing storm , earthquake and tsunami warnings . ->","completion":" This Nokia Bell Labs researcher has discovered an exciting new way to protect our network and gain valuable insights about the world around us. The backbone of the internet is made up of tiny strands of fiber optic cables, which allow us to send messages at incredible speeds. However, when these cables experience unexpected outages, it can lead to costly repairs and service disruptions. That's where Mikael Mazur comes in. He has developed a groundbreaking technology that turns these communication fibers into environmental sensors. By detecting vibrations and distortions in the fiber, Mazur's prototype can help us identify network failures before they happen. This not only ensures a more reliable and robust network, but it also has the potential to revolutionize ecological monitoring. We could use this technology to track climate change, measure temperature shifts, monitor ocean currents, and even detect earthquakes. Mazur will be presenting his findings at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference, a prestigious event for the optical research community. His goal is to combine the functions of fiber optics to create a self-monitoring system that can predict and prevent network issues. Fibers are already great at sensing vibrations, which is why they are used in critical infrastructure like bridges and buildings. Now, by incorporating this capability into our communication cables, we can have a system that warns us of potential problems caused by extreme weather conditions and other external factors. This early detection allows engineers to take proactive measures to prevent network failures. Mazur's 524-km aerial cable, deployed in harsh conditions in Sweden, is a testament to the potential of this technology. The cable, which is wrapped around high-voltage power cables, is the first of its kind. Mazur believes that his sensing functionality, compatible with existing optical transceiver architectures, is crucial since we deploy so much fiber to the grid. By knowing ahead of time that a link is going down, we can minimize the impact on our network. This innovation not only offers a cost-effective alternative to expensive fiber-sensing devices but also provides vendors with a competitive advantage in a time when improving speed performance is becoming more challenging. Mazur's work pushes the boundaries of science by exploring new ways to enhance fiber optics. While we are nearing the limit of how much error-free information can be transmitted through these cables, Mazur believes that using multiple spatial channels and incorporating sensing capabilities can lead to higher capacities and novel approaches. This dual-purpose technology not only protects the network but also has far-reaching benefits for environmental monitoring. By monitoring wind, temperature, currents, and more, we can better prepare for natural disasters like storms, earthquakes, and tsunamis. In earthquake-prone areas, sophisticated seismic instruments are already in place, but this technology can be a game-changer in remote locations, such as the deep oceans. Overall, Mazur's research offers a positive outlook for the future of our network and the potential to gain valuable insights about the world we live in. END"}

The company is dedicated to fostering the growth of digital agriculture by collaborating with farmers to adopt new technologies. Realizing the absence of a reliable resource for farmers to digitally transform their farms, the team at Case IH took it upon themselves to drive this initiative. They developed the concept of the connected farm, aiming to harness the advantages of digital technology.\n\nRecognizing the Benefits of Digital Agriculture: Case IH understands the significant advantages offered by digital agriculture. With technologies like digital connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT), drones, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and analytics, agriculture can become more sustainable by reducing the use of pesticides, fertilizer, and water. These innovations also enable precision farming. In fact, Bell Labs Consulting predicts that if 25% of farms adopt precision farming by 2030, it could result in yearly yield increases of up to 300 million tons and a reduction in farming costs of up to US$100 billion. These figures are critical in ensuring food security for our growing global population.\n\nBuilding the Connected Farm: To establish the connected farm, a laboratory for testing, learning, and gathering feedback from the farming community, Case IH required more than just their digital expertise. They needed a connectivity partner with the knowledge and experience to navigate Brazil's vast agricultural landscape. Tim Brasil, an existing partner of Case IH on another agricultural project, immediately stepped up when informed about the connected farm project. \"Our focus on agriculture is crucial for the country, as it contributes to 25% of Brazil's GDP,\" says Paulo Gouvea from Tim Brasil.\n\nConnecting an Expansive Continent: Tim Brasil boasts the largest mobile network coverage in the country, serving over 5,400 cities. They are committed to achieving 100% 4G coverage (or 5,570 cities) by 2023. However, their challenge lies in connecting the remote rural areas of Brazil. Gouvea states, \"I would say Brazil is like a continent. With over 300 million hectares of agricultural areas, we face a significant challenge.\" The business model for service providers typically relies on the number of subscribers per square kilometer, which doesn't align with the needs of rural farming communities. Therefore, a new viable business model had to be developed for the connected farm project to thrive.\n\nFinding the Perfect Location: With Tim Brasil providing the ideal connectivity, Case IH turned its attention to finding a suitable location for the project. \"We wanted a location that truly represents Brazilian agriculture,\" explains Christian Gonzalez from Case IH. They desired to showcase how rural connectivity can enhance in-field productivity, even in already highly productive regions. Rather than creating a farm from scratch, they sought a partner who shared their vision. After careful consideration, they found the perfect partner in Água Boa, a small city in the heart of soybean production in Mato Grosso state. This area has approximately 80,000 inhabitants and is experiencing rapid agricultural development. Gouvea adds, \"Água Boa translates to 'good water' in English. We chose this area to demonstrate that technology can increase production without relying on artificial means. We believed that if it worked here, it could work anywhere else in the country.\" END"}

As someone who has been involved in the microgrid sector for almost a decade, I hadn't expected Nokia to be involved in such an initiative. While I have covered various aspects of microgrids, including financing, regulation, and technical development, the communication infrastructure underlying these systems has not been a major focus in my consulting projects. Participating in Nokia's #realaction microgrid series offered me a chance to gain new insights into this important aspect, given Nokia's position as a market leader.\n\nExciting Collaboration for Real Change\n\nNokia has chosen microgrids as the topic for its second series of the real action campaign and has brought together a team of exceptional experts to collaborate and make a positive impact. What truly excited me about being part of Nokia's real action green, local energy - microgrids initiative was the opportunity to work alongside industry experts, each bringing their specific expertise to the table. My teammates, Leslie Labruto, Liana Jo Ault, Marilyn Waite, and our wonderful host, Jason Elliott from Nokia, made this a truly enriching experience.\n\nMaking Reliable Energy Access Sustainable\n\nThe challenge we face is significant - 789 million people worldwide lack access to electricity, and many more struggle with an unreliable energy supply. Significant investments in energy infrastructure are essential. However, the game has changed as renewable energy sources now make up the majority of newly added power generation capacity. This shift allows for a more decentralized approach to power generation compared to traditional fossil fuel and nuclear plants. Microgrids take this a step further by providing reliable energy on a local, community level. Whether it's a remote African community or an area in the global north facing energy reliability issues due to lack of grid investments or natural disasters, microgrids offer a solution. By integrating as much local renewable energy as possible, microgrids can even surpass national grid levels in achieving higher renewable shares. This is why microgrids are becoming a driving force in our journey towards full decarbonization.\n\nFinding the Right Energy Mix\n\nWhen it comes to producing energy locally, microgrids must harness the available renewable energy sources on-site effectively. While geothermal and hydroelectric sources are location-specific, wind and solar power are accessible nearly everywhere. However, solar and wind energy are intermittent and do not match the current demand directly. This necessitates combining them with flexible power units like diesel gensets or energy storage systems such as lithium-ion batteries, redox flow batteries, or hydrogen systems. Today, it is crucial to test and prove the concept of 100% renewable energy microgrids. However, for efficiency and profitability, microgrids must strike the right balance of renewable energy sources. Extreme seasonal variations in energy supply or demand would require expensive energy storage systems to achieve 100% renewable microgrids, which may not be economically viable. It might be more practical to build a larger number of microgrids that are not entirely dependent on renewables, with a smaller percentage operating on 100% renewable energy. Nevertheless, when designing microgrids, it is important to pave the way for future decarbonization steps as costs for renewables and energy storage continue to decrease. END"}

However, they have not fully tapped into the potential of global markets, with less than 4% of SMEs exporting goods in 2020. But there is a solution on the horizon.\n\nA recent research report by the Standards Council of Canada suggests that standardization could be a key factor in increasing Canadian SME exports. When venturing into the global market, SMEs face numerous challenges. They must meet the specific technical regulations, product standards, and certifications required by their target countries, which can be expensive and difficult to navigate, especially if their technology doesn't align with these standards.\n\nDiane Liao, SCC Program Manager and co-author of the report, acknowledges the challenges faced by SMEs and the need for strategies to help them grow. Having worked closely with SMEs over the years, she has witnessed firsthand the benefits of standardization. By analyzing how SMEs can participate in standards development, we can truly drive Canada's economic growth.\n\nInternational standards have proven to be an effective way to tackle some of these challenges. By adhering to these written guidelines, SMEs can achieve certification and demonstrate their compliance with regulations. Participating in the development of international standards allows countries to gain both economic and political influence by aligning their own standards with their interests. This is a crucial first step towards helping more SMEs access global markets.\n\nLiao emphasizes the importance of taking a strategic and planned approach to international standards' development. By doing so, Canada can reduce technical barriers to trade, opening doors for more SMEs to join global value chains. This knowledge is significant for both SMEs and the organizations supporting their growth, including the Canadian government. Encouraging and investing in Canadian SME participation in standards could lead to a boost in our country's exports.\n\nAccording to SCC's analysis of the national SME survey results, Canada's involvement in international standards' development has a positive impact on our exports and helps engage more SMEs in international trade. By participating in additional technical committees where international standards like ISO and IEC are developed, we could potentially see over 200 more SMEs exporting goods, with an estimated value of CAD 516 million. This valuable insight is essential for SMEs and organizations supporting their growth.\n\nTo learn more about this topic, you can check out the paper published by the International Journal of Standardization Research.

We promised to make bold and unconventional moves, even if they seemed strange or speculative compared to our existing businesses. Throughout our journey, we have strived to accomplish more and pursue meaningful endeavors with the resources at our disposal. Some of the endeavors we pursued initially seemed crazy, but they now have over a billion users, such as Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven't stopped there. We are still passionately pursuing ventures that others may consider crazy, but that excite us greatly.\n\nWe have always believed that companies tend to become complacent over time, making only incremental changes. However, in the ever-evolving technology industry, revolutionary ideas are essential for growth and relevance. We must remain slightly uncomfortable to stay ahead. While our company is currently operating well, we believe we can make it even more efficient and accountable. This is why we are creating a new company called Alphabet. I am thrilled to be the CEO of Alphabet, with Sergey as President and my capable partner.\n\nWhat is Alphabet, you may ask? Alphabet is primarily a collection of companies, with Google being the largest among them. However, this new version of Google will be more focused, with some of our ventures that are not directly related to our main internet products falling under the Alphabet umbrella. These ventures include our health efforts, such as Life Sciences (which developed the glucose-sensing contact lens) and Calico (which focuses on longevity). This structure provides us with greater management flexibility, allowing us to run independent ventures more effectively. Alphabet is all about empowering businesses through strong leadership and independence. Each business will have a dedicated CEO, and Sergey and I will provide support as needed. We will prioritize capital allocation and ensure that each business executes its strategies effectively. We will also ensure that each business has an exceptional CEO, with their compensation determined accordingly. Additionally, we plan to provide separate financial reporting for Google and the rest of Alphabet's businesses starting from Q4.\n\nThis new structure allows us to maintain a laser focus on the exciting opportunities within Google. A crucial part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been an exceptional leader, often articulating thoughts that align perfectly with my own, if not better! Since taking on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses in October, Sundar has consistently impressed Sergey and me with his dedication and progress. It is clear to us and our board that the time has come for Sundar to become the CEO of Google. I feel incredibly fortunate to have someone as talented as him leading the slightly streamlined Google, as it frees up my time to further scale our aspirations. I have been actively supporting Sundar and the company, and I will continue to do so. Google itself continues to innovate and launch new products under Sundar's leadership, always pushing boundaries. Sundar deeply cares about our core mission of organizing the world's information, and recent developments like Google Photos and Google Now's use of machine learning are remarkable examples of our progress. Some of our services, like YouTube, operate under their own identity, and Susan, as CEO, is doing an outstanding job managing this strong brand and driving remarkable growth. END"}

While we may have initially planned to retire at a specific age, life sometimes throws unexpected curveballs, like the current pandemic. It's been a challenging period for all of us, and as a result, many Canadians are reevaluating their retirement plans. Approximately 8 million Canadians now anticipate retiring either earlier or later due to the impact of COVID-19.\n\nWhile financial planning for retirement is often emphasized, the lifestyle adjustments that come with this new chapter are sometimes overlooked. Whether you're retiring earlier, later, or on schedule, it's important to navigate this change as smoothly as possible. Assuming your financial preparations are in order, here are a few tips to help you transition gracefully into retirement:\n\n1. Take it at your own pace: You've spent decades getting to know yourself, so trust your instincts during this transition. Some individuals might be eager to jet off on an adventure right after their retirement party (once travel advisories have lifted), while others might prefer a more relaxed approach, enjoying books and shows before pursuing their retirement goals.\n\n2. Stay connected: Regardless of whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, maintaining contact with important people in your life is crucial. Since you may have spent more time with colleagues than family and friends throughout your working years, make an effort to nurture those relationships in your new retirement lifestyle. Coffee chats with friends, joining a club, or even video chatting with loved ones can help you feel connected.\n\n3. Find fulfilling activities: Your job provided structure and a sense of accomplishment for many years. In retirement, it's important to find activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Consider creating a retirement schedule or a list of daily goals to maintain a routine. Remember to prioritize rest, set both big and small goals, and establish a regular routine that suits your needs.\n\n4. Explore part-time work or volunteering: Engaging in part-time work or volunteering can provide a sense of purpose, connection, and accomplishment. Whether you choose to volunteer at a healthcare facility, work with animals, or pursue any other interest, these experiences can be truly enriching. If you're unsure about volunteering opportunities, there are plenty of ideas and resources available for retirees.\n\n5. Nurture your relationship with your partner: If both you and your partner are retired, you'll have more time together than ever before. This adjustment may take some getting used to, but psychologist Katherine King offers helpful tips for maintaining a strong marriage after retirement. Remember to be patient and supportive, avoid relying solely on your spouse for entertainment, and take this opportunity to rediscover yourself.\n\n6. Prioritize healthcare planning: Even if you feel healthy and active at the start of retirement, it's essential to plan for any potential health scenarios. Since your group benefits may end when you retire, consider a plan like followme™ health and dental insurance* to help cover medical costs. Applying within 90 days of your work plan ending guarantees acceptance and provides coverage for both expected and unexpected healthcare needs.\n\nWith these tips in mind, we wish you the best of luck, happiness, and good health as you embark on this new chapter of your life.

Together, they formed a formidable team of machine learning experts with a track record of winning numerous competitions. Though Titericz experimented with large language models (LLMs) to create generative AI for predicting product names, none proved successful. However, the team's creativity led them to discover an alternative solution. Their new hybrid ranking\/classifier model produced accurate predictions, surpassing all expectations.\n\nAs the competition neared its end, the team frantically packaged all their models together for a few final submissions, running experiments overnight on up to 40 computers. Kazuki Onodera, a Kaggle grandmaster based in Tokyo, couldn't help but feel nervous. \"I had no idea if our actual scores would match what we estimated,\" he admitted. Fortunately, their efforts paid off, and the team snatched victory from their closest rival in a thrilling photo finish.\n\nIn another task, the team faced the challenge of applying knowledge from large datasets in English, German, and Japanese to smaller datasets in French, Italian, and Spanish. This mirrors the real-world obstacle that many companies encounter when expanding their digital presence globally.

This loss widened by $58 million compared to the previous year. However, despite the challenges, the corporation ended the year with stronger revenue in the parcel business than before the pandemic started. While transaction mail volumes continued to decline, direct marketing revenue and volumes slowly recovered. To reduce costs, Canada Post made strategic investments to improve service, tracking, network capabilities, and customer experience. The growth of the Canada Post network added to costs as the corporation has the obligation to deliver to all Canadian addresses, which increased by approximately 219,000 during the year. \n\nThe ecommerce parcel delivery sector in Canada has undergone significant transformation in recent years due to the rise in online shopping. Although online shopping has slowed due to economic uncertainty and cost of living increases, the ecommerce market is expected to double in the next decade. As parcels account for approximately half of Canada Post's revenue, the corporation is investing to strengthen its position in this competitive market and continue being a reliable delivery partner. While immediate focus is on essential investments and improvements, the long-term goal is financial self-sustainability while serving all Canadians.\n\nIn 2022, parcels revenue declined by 2.3% and volumes fell by 20.4% compared to 2021 due to increased competition, reduced consumer spending, and the return to in-store shopping. Limited shipping capacity from China and supply chain disruptions also affected inbound parcels. To mitigate the decline in revenue, Canada Post managed its commercial customer and product mix strategically. The corporation also invested in capacity to position its parcels business for long-term growth.\n\nTransaction mail revenue declined by 2.4% as volumes fell by 6.3% compared to 2021. This decline was due to the absence of events like the 2021 census and federal election mailings that boosted the line of business in the previous year. Additionally, maintaining regulated stamp prices at 2020 levels throughout 2022 negatively affected revenues. Transaction mail faces erosion as consumers and mailers shift to digital channels.\n\nOn the other hand, direct marketing revenue increased by 3.9% as volumes rose by 2.1% compared to 2021.

However, campaigns slowed due to economic uncertainty and reduced spending. Declining consumer spending and global paper shortages also affected demand for marketing campaigns. Despite these challenges, Canada Post continues to invest in direct marketing products to maximize their value proposition and integrate them with digital experiences. END"}
{"prompt":"while i’m only a week or so into using the ios 17 beta — i’m getting too old for this shit ? — it’s already pretty clear what the standout feature is standby . this is the new mode where when you have your iphone in landscape mode whilst charging , it displays a new data presentation style , geared towards far more glanceable information . things like the time , the date , the weather , etc . it sounds mundane . and it is . but it’s also brilliant . the obvious use case is as a bed-side clock . and it’s good for that . while you might worry about having a screen beaming its backlight in your face all night , apple has created a smart mode ( “night mode” ) that shifts all the visuals to red . it looks like you’re on a submarine . or like it’s defcon 1 . it’s cool — albeit slightly masculine ? it’s clearly borrowed from the “night mode” on the new apple watch ultra — more on this in a bit — but it’s arguably more useful here . but this bed-side use case also begs the obvious apple doesn’t sell a dock that currently easily allows for you to enter this mode . third-party accessory makers do — i have this one by belkin , which is great ( though pricey ) — but it’s sort of wild that apple has no way to do this beyond propping your iphone up at an angle while charging . it’s so overt — and the new functionality is so good — that i have to believe we’ll see a new iphone charger announced alongside the iphone 15 in a few weeks . my guess is that it will be a wireless charging “puck” on a stand . maybe they’ll even sell one like belkin’s which lets you charge the apple watch as well — eat your never-shipped heart out , airpower . i mean , they have to do this . again , the third-party docks work well , but apple can’t just leave this money on the table . it’s not in their nature . one other option would be for apple to offer a new type of case which allows you to prop the device up . this is actually the type of “case” i’ve been using for the past year or so . i say “case” because it’s not actually a case , it’s more like a magnetic wallet that attaches via magsafe . but it works well to both elevate the camera system off any table when folded flat , and to prop up the iphone , either vertically or horizontally , when folded out . apple should replace their current wallet product with something like this . because again , it would also allow you to enter standby mode when charging ( in this case , with a cable ) . i actually love this ability when sitting at my desk . i prop up my iphone horizontally with this case while it’s plugged in via a lightning cable ( and soon , usb-c , with the iphone 15 ) . one of the standby widgets allows you to control music via a nice , large interface purpose built for standby mode . i love this . it’s both a visually pleasing way to see what you’re listening to , while also giving you easy-to-tap controls for the music . you too can dj while working . but the best part is the album artwork , which is nice and large — something i’ve long complained about a lack of focus on with all the digital music services — and has a nice little flip animation as tracks change . when paired with a homepod ( or airpods ) , it’s all brilliant . yes , if you’re using your computer , you could just open apple music and listen to music there , but again , this is a far better ui and experience . it’s great . i’m reminded of the old school itunes interface for the imac — you know the one that came with a remote . because of said accessory , apple created a new ui mode to be able to see media from afar . i often miss that interface . standby almost gets us back there , in a way . ->","completion":" While I've only been using the iOS 17 beta for about a week, I must admit that I'm starting to feel a bit out of touch with all these new updates. However, one feature that really stands out to me is a standby mode. This mode is activated when your iPhone is in landscape mode while charging, and it presents information in a more convenient and easily readable format. It includes details like the time, date, and weather, among other things. Now, I know this may seem rather mundane, but trust me, it's actually quite brilliant.\n\nThe most obvious use for standby mode is as a bedside clock, and it works great for that purpose. If you're concerned about having a bright screen shining in your face all night, don't worry! Apple has thoughtfully included a \"night mode\" option which turns everything red. It creates a cool atmosphere, almost like being on a submarine or preparing for a major event. It's pretty neat, although some may find it slightly more appealing to a masculine audience. This feature is clearly inspired by the \"night mode\" on the new Apple Watch Ultra, but I personally find it even more useful on the iPhone.\n\nHowever, using your iPhone as a bedside clock does raise a valid concern - Apple doesn't currently sell a dock that allows you to easily activate this mode. Third-party accessory makers have come up with solutions, like the one I have from Belkin, but it's a bit surprising that Apple hasn't addressed this yet. I have a feeling that they'll release a new iPhone charger alongside the iPhone 15 in a few weeks. My guess is that it will be a wireless charging \"puck\" on a stand. Maybe they'll even offer one like Belkin's that can charge the Apple Watch as well. It's about time, especially considering the long-awaited AirPower never materialized. Apple wouldn't want to miss out on this opportunity; after all, it's not in their nature.\n\nAnother option Apple could consider is offering a new type of case that allows you to prop up the device. Personally, I've been using a unique magnetic wallet-like case for the past year. It not only elevates the camera system when folded flat on a table but also props up the iPhone vertically or horizontally when unfolded. Apple should consider replacing their current wallet product with something similar to this. It would not only serve its primary purpose but also enable standby mode while charging (using a cable in this case). I find this feature particularly useful when I'm sitting at my desk. I simply prop up my iPhone horizontally using this case and connect it with a lightning cable (soon to be USB-C with the iPhone 15). One of the standby widgets allows me to control my music with a visually pleasing, large interface specifically designed for standby mode. It's like being a DJ while working. \n\nBut the best part is the album artwork, which is displayed beautifully and prominently. I've always felt that digital music services lacked focus on album artwork, so this is a welcome change. As tracks change, there's even a delightful flip animation. When paired with a HomePod or AirPods, the whole experience is truly brilliant. Yes, you could just open Apple Music on your computer and listen to music there, but trust me, this UI and experience are far superior. I'm even reminded of the classic iTunes interface for the iMac that came with a remote. Thanks to that accessory, Apple created a new UI mode that allowed us to view media from a distance. I've always missed that interface, and standby mode brings us a step closer to it in a way. END"}

Unfortunately, drug shortages have become more common in recent years due to various reasons such as global supply constraints, manufacturing issues, difficulties in accessing raw materials, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is some good news. Health Canada experts, led by Stephanie Di Trapani, Director of Health Canada's Drug Shortages Division, are working tirelessly to address these shortages.\n\nIn 2012, Canada faced a critical national shortage of painkillers, anesthetics, antibiotics, and hospital injectable products. This had severe consequences, with people unable to access necessary medications and surgeries being postponed or canceled. This shortage served as a wake-up call for Health Canada, highlighting the need for proactive measures and increased coordination among all stakeholders. In response, the Multi-Stakeholder Steering Committee on Drug Shortages (MSSC) was formed, bringing together federal, provincial, and territorial governments, as well as health professionals, patient groups, and industry associations. This committee aims to improve information sharing and identify actions to manage and mitigate drug shortages in Canada.\n\nWhile the creation of the MSSC improved responses to shortages, more information from manufacturers was still needed to prevent and mitigate shortages effectively. Recognizing this, Ms. Di Trapani and her team worked on new regulations requiring manufacturers to report existing and anticipated shortages, as well as discontinuations of certain prescription medications. Canada was among the first countries to implement such reporting regulations. These regulations have enhanced Health Canada's ability to assess supply and demand, identify options to mitigate shortages, ensure timely communication among all stakeholders, and collaborate on strategies to strengthen the supply chain.\n\nDespite these efforts, some shortages cannot be completely avoided or quickly resolved due to their complexity and factors beyond our control. Recently, Canada experienced a shortage of children's analgesics and antibiotics, which lasted for eight months. Ms. Di Trapani and her team worked tirelessly to find solutions. They collaborated with manufacturers to secure supplies from other countries, contacted pharmacists to manage supplies, and provided information and advice to affected parents and caregivers through health professionals. Lessons learned from this shortage are already being applied to prepare for the upcoming cold and flu season.\n\nWhile Health Canada experts and stakeholders are doing everything they can to manage shortages, they cannot do it alone. They need your assistance. To learn more about how drug shortages are managed and how you can help, please refer to the infographic below. Together, we can make a difference in ensuring access to vital medications and health products for all. END"}

Climate change has the ability to make these heat events longer and more intense, making it even more important to take precautions. That's where heat alert and response systems (known as HARs) come in. These systems are implemented by communities to help them prepare for and respond to extreme heat.\n\nHARs consist of several components, including community mobilization and engagement, an alert protocol, a communications plan, a community response plan, and an evaluation plan. In a nutshell, HARs help communities and regions be ready for extreme heat events and know how to take action when they occur. Rachel Siblock, a policy analyst in Health Canada's Heat Division, explains that the first step for communities is to determine the threshold for activating their heat response plans. This usually aligns with the heat alerts and warnings issued by Environment and Climate Change Canada. Once the threshold is met, communities can then decide which activities within their plans will be implemented.\n\nEvery community is unique, so their HARs may include various activities to protect their citizens from extreme heat. Some examples include distributing bottled water, opening cooling centers, and encouraging residents to check in on vulnerable individuals at home. Rachel emphasizes that each community has the flexibility to decide what actions are most appropriate for them.\n\nDifferent communities implement HARs in different ways. Urban centers may have cooling centers or splash pads that are easily accessible, while rural areas may focus on messaging that encourages people to check on their neighbors who may be more vulnerable to heat-related problems. Health Canada provides guidance and information to help local and regional health authorities develop evidence-based extreme heat plans and interventions. Rachel and her colleagues also play a connecting role, linking municipal and health officials with experts from other parts of Canada who can provide valuable insights.\n\nRachel notes that any action taken during a heat event has the potential to protect health, and increasing community leadership and support has proven to be effective. When people understand the impact of heat, they are usually willing to get involved. Currently, the team is collaborating with BC's Interior Health Authority on a pilot project to develop culturally appropriate and safe HARs with Indigenous communities in the region. Any community interested in developing their own HARs is encouraged to contact the Heat Division and join Health Canada's Heat Community of Practice, a network dedicated to protecting Canadians from the health impacts of extreme heat.

This may lead people to wonder why these outbreaks are happening and if they are at risk. To understand the current situation, it's important to learn more about how vaccination works as a preventive measure for public health. Today, I invite you on a journey to explore vaccines and why they are so important.\n\nI am incredibly grateful for Canada's long history of strong vaccination programs and the positive impact they have had on improving health. Let me share a few examples with you. Vaccines have played a crucial role in saving lives and enhancing the well-being of people in Canada and across the globe by reducing or eliminating the spread of serious infectious diseases. According to the World Health Organization, vaccination prevents 3.5 to 5 million deaths annually from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, and measles. Early studies also suggest that COVID-19 vaccines have prevented millions of deaths worldwide. Thanks to vaccines, we have successfully eradicated smallpox, meaning that it no longer exists, and we no longer need to vaccinate against it. Moreover, other diseases have seen significant reductions in their rates.\n\nVaccines are vital because they help prevent and protect against specific diseases. They work with our body's natural defenses, known as the immune system, to make us less susceptible to infections and less likely to develop severe illness. Vaccines also decrease the chances of spreading infections from one person to another. By exposing our bodies to harmless parts of bacteria or viruses, called antigens, vaccines allow our immune system to develop a response against them. If we are later exposed to the same bacterium or virus, our immune system will recognize the antigen and respond more quickly, helping to prevent us from getting the disease or experiencing severe illness if we do contract it.\n\nSome vaccines also contribute to community immunity, also known as herd immunity. This means that the more people who are vaccinated against a disease, the less likely it is to spread within a community. This protection benefits individuals who are at higher risk of severe complications from vaccine preventable diseases, including those who cannot be vaccinated or for whom a particular vaccine may not be as effective, such as those with weakened immune systems.\n\nLet's now delve into some vaccines available to us and the significant impact they have had in Canada. In addition to the ones mentioned below, there are vaccines that can prevent various other illnesses, such as certain types of pneumonia, meningitis, chickenpox, shingles, and hepatitis B, among others. There are also vaccines specifically designed to combat respiratory viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccines recommended for travelers depending on their destination.\n\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is particularly crucial in preventing the spread of contagious diseases. Measles, in particular, can result in serious complications such as pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, which can lead to permanent brain damage or even death. It is also highly contagious, easily spreading among unvaccinated or previously unexposed individuals. To break the chain of transmission, approximately 95 out of 100 people who have never had a measles' infection need to be vaccinated. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining high population-level measles vaccination coverage to prevent outbreaks. Thankfully, the MMR vaccine protects against all three of these highly contagious viruses. In Canada, thanks to the introduction of these vaccines in the 1960s and their inclusion in routine vaccination programs, cases of measles, mumps, and rubella have decreased by 98% or more.\n\nBy understanding the importance of vaccines and the immense impact they have had in Canada and beyond, we can continue to prioritize vaccination as a key investment in improving population health and reducing healthcare costs.

While this foodborne illness may not be as well-known as others, it can have serious consequences. Luckily, botulism is very rare in Canada thanks to our safe food practices and the dedicated scientists at Health Canada. Botulism is caused by eating food and drinks contaminated with a potent toxin called botulinum toxin, produced by bacteria called clostridium botulinum.\n\nThe symptoms of botulism typically include blurred and double vision, drooping eyelids, and difficulty swallowing and speaking. In severe cases, paralysis may affect the muscles that help us breathe, requiring the use of mechanical ventilation. It can take months or even years to fully recover from the effects of botulism. Unfortunately, approximately one in ten people with botulism die from the disease.\n\nDr. John Austin, a research scientist at Health Canada, along with lab technicians Dr. Richard Harris and Ryan Boone, analyze botulism samples and conduct research on the disease and the bacterium that causes it. Their work is crucial in finding ways to better protect Canadians from botulism. Let's take a closer look at how their efforts help keep us safe.\n\nIdentifying the Dangerous Toxin\n\nThere are different types of botulism, but the main ones are foodborne botulism and infant botulism. Foodborne botulism can occur in environments without oxygen, such as canned foods. It can also be found in other foods like garlic stored in oil, carrot juice, salted fish, and traditionally prepared seal, whale, and walrus meat. Infant botulism occurs when the c. botulinum bacteria, sometimes found in honey, grow inside a baby's body and produce toxins. Because infants don't yet have enough good bacteria in their bodies, the c. botulinum bacteria can thrive and produce botulinum toxin.\n\nWorking with the Medical Community\n\n\"Botulinum toxin is the most potent toxin known. The oral lethal dose for a person is estimated to be approximately 70 millionths of a gram or 0.00007g, which is an tiny amount,\" explains Dr. Austin. Due to the dangerous nature of botulism, early intervention is crucial. Doctors prescribe antitoxins to patients suspected of having botulism and send clinical samples to the Botulism Reference Service, run by Dr. Austin and his technicians, to confirm the diagnosis. Thankfully, most samples don't test positive for botulism, but this information is still valuable for doctors to rule out botulism as the cause of illness and improve patient care. When botulism is confirmed, they work with provinces and local health units to trace the source and recall the contaminated food product, preventing further cases.\n\nHelping Food Manufacturers and Indigenous Communities Improve Food Safety Practices\n\nIn addition to assisting the medical and public health communities, Dr. Austin and his colleagues are committed to making our food safer. \"We're always searching for ways to make food safer, so that botulism becomes even rarer. That's why we continue to study new methods to eliminate the bacteria and its spores,\" explains Dr. Austin. One of these new methods involves using UV light to pasteurize or kill c. botulinum in foods. If proven safe and effective, this method could soon be adopted by food manufacturers for commercial foods. Additionally, Dr. Austin and his team recognized that certain traditional Indigenous foods, such as seal, can be sources of botulism.

Let's take a moment to reflect on the historical journey towards justice and equality for these communities.\n\nIn Canada, on March 24, 1853, the Provincial Freeman, an influential anti-slavery newspaper, was first published. Its motto, \"self-reliance is the true road to independence,\" captured the hopes and ambitions of Mary Ann Shadd, the first black woman in North America to publish and edit a newspaper. It represented a belief that emancipation from slavery was just the beginning of a long road towards justice, equity, and economic freedom for black and afro-descendant people.\n\nUnfortunately, the path to true equality has not been smooth. Even after abolition, anti-black sentiment evolved rather than disappeared. Discriminatory land title clauses, such as the one used in Vancouver in 1928, restricted the sale or rental of land to people of African descent. Viola Desmond's arrest in 1946 for sitting in a whites-only section of a movie theatre in Nova Scotia highlighted the ongoing segregation. It wasn't until 1965 that the last segregated school in Ontario closed, and it took until 1983 for the last one in Canada to follow suit in Lincolnville, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe intergenerational trauma experienced by black and afro-descendant communities persists, with systemic anti-black racism deeply ingrained in our society, including the financial services sector. To achieve true emancipation, we must examine the workings of our society and collaborate with these communities to identify and address the gaps in support. Only then can we make a lasting and positive difference by empowering black and afro-descendant communities economically and dismantling the systemic barriers they face within our financial system.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that change has not come swiftly enough for those who need it most. However, history has shown that through collective action and a commitment to be better and more active allies, we can create a future where everyone, regardless of their identity, can be their authentic selves and thrive. Though progress may have felt slow at times, the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent outcry against anti-black racism remind us that change cannot wait. A recent study by Abacus Data in Canada revealed that 76% of black entrepreneurs surveyed believed that their race makes it harder for them to succeed, and access to capital was identified as their greatest barrier. Furthermore, only 19% of respondents expressed trust in banks to act in their best interest and that of their community.\n\nSo, let's come together and take action. We cannot afford to wait any longer for the change we all deserve. By actively engaging, working hard, and pledging to be better allies, we can make a tangible difference in the lives of black and afro-descendant communities. Together, we can build a society where everyone has equal opportunities and where banking truly serves the needs of all. END"}

Buying a home is a big step, and it's likely the most expensive purchase you'll ever make. Depending on the price of the home you want, you may need to save up for a down payment of 5%, 10%, or even 20% or more. But don't forget about other costs like land transfer taxes, lawyer fees, home insurance, and inspections. These expenses can add up quickly, depending on where you live and the type of property you're interested in.\n\nWhile creating a budget is a good starting point for saving, it's also important to consider how you're saving, especially if you have your sights set on homeownership. There are registered savings plans available to Canadians, including the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). Starting in 2023, you can also take advantage of the FHSA. These registered savings plans allow your money to grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and you can invest in things like Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) and mutual funds.\n\nAt TD, you can now open an FHSA to kickstart your savings journey towards your first home. To help you understand how the FHSA works and how it can benefit you, let's take a quick refresher on TFSAs and RRSPs. TFSAs allow you to grow your money tax-free on qualified investments, like interest earned, dividends, and capital gains (subject to restrictions). You can withdraw your funds at any time, tax-free. With TD Direct Investing, you can even include stocks and bonds in your TFSA.\n\nOn the other hand, RRSPs are mainly focused on retirement savings. Contributions to an RRSP are tax-deductible, meaning you can reduce the total amount of taxes you pay in a year. Any investment income earned within the RRSP grows tax-deferred until it's withdrawn. While RRSPs are primarily for retirement savings, you can access the funds earlier in certain situations, like through the Home Buyers' Plan. This plan allows you to withdraw up to $35,000 from your RRSP tax-free to put towards the purchase or construction of a qualifying home for yourself or a related person with a disability.\n\nThe FHSA combines some features of an RRSP and a TFSA. Contributions to an FHSA are generally tax-deductible, just like with an RRSP. And when you make a qualifying withdrawal from an FHSA to buy your dream home, the amount withdrawn, including any income or gain, is not taxable. It's a great way to save for your first home while enjoying the benefits of tax advantages.\n\nIn summary, the FHSA is an exciting opportunity for Canadians to save for their first home. It offers a unique combination of features from both TFSA and RRSP, making it an attractive option. Whether you choose to save in a TFSA, an RRSP, or an FHSA, it's important to make the most of the registered accounts available to you. Start saving now and turn your dream of homeownership into a reality! END"}

Having conversations about money can be difficult, whether it's with family, friends, or a partner, especially during uncertain economic times when finances are tight. A recent survey conducted by Maru Public Opinion for TD Bank revealed some interesting insights. While 82% of respondents said they can comfortably pay their bills and meet their financial obligations, 75% mentioned that the rising cost of living has made it harder to save or invest as much as they would like. In fact, 59% of respondents find it challenging to find extra money to save or invest. \n\nTo address the rising cost of living, some Canadians are choosing to live together and share housing expenses. According to Natasha Struminikovski, Associate Vice President of Homeowners Journey at TD Bank, approximately 23% of Canadians live with a roommate or family member outside their spouse\/partner or child. Among these respondents, 79% said they would find it difficult to live on their own. Convenience was cited as the reason by 40% of respondents, while 56% mentioned saving money as their motivation. Struminikovski noted that many Canadians are consciously prioritizing saving and investing for their future, which is a wise financial decision.\n\nFor couples, discussing money becomes crucial when considering their housing situation. The advantage of being in a couple is that there are often two incomes to consider. To achieve financial intimacy, it's important to disclose information such as income, credit scores, debt, spending habits, and attitudes toward money. According to the survey, 77% of respondents living with a roommate or family member would have the money talk before moving in together, while only 5% would wait until after. However, for those already living with their spouse or partner, 54% talked about money before moving in, while 21% discussed it afterward. Interestingly, 4% of respondents admitted to never having a proper conversation about money with their partner or spouse.\n\nWhen it comes to managing finances in a long-term relationship, whether to keep separate bank accounts, have joint accounts, or a combination of both arises. The survey found that 48% of respondents living with a roommate or family member other than a spouse\/partner expected to have both joint and personal accounts. Meanwhile, 41% stated they would continue to have their separate accounts, and only 11% planned to merge all their finances into joint accounts. Household income also played a role in this decision, as those making less than $50,000 were more likely to keep their finances separate compared to those with higher incomes.\n\nIt's clear from the survey that many Canadians are facing financial challenges, but they are also finding creative ways to overcome them. Whether it's living with roommates, discussing money with partners before moving in together, or managing separate and joint accounts, Canadians are taking proactive steps to navigate their financial journeys.

This is a common question many people have when considering the Canadian housing market. According to TD economist Rishi Sondhi, mortgage rates play a significant role in influencing housing prices. However, it's important to note that they are not the sole determining factor. Other factors such as the job market, population growth, and housing supply also contribute to the overall picture.\n\nCurrently, Canada's housing market is favoring sellers over buyers. In April, existing home sales reached their highest level since June of the previous year, and prices rose by 6% month-over-month. The supply of available homes, however, has not kept up with the demand, resulting in increased competition and a market that benefits sellers. Despite the strong demand and rising prices, the number of new listings remains low, which might seem surprising.\n\nSondhi explains that there are several reasons for the limited supply of homes. One of them is the presence of \"forced selling,\" where homeowners are not compelled to sell their properties due to favorable conditions in the job market and the ability to extend their mortgage amortization in a high-interest rate environment. Some individuals with variable rate mortgages are able to extend the length of their mortgage to afford regular payments.\n\nAdditionally, investors with rental properties are opting to hold onto their properties due to the strength of the rental market. Construction timelines for new homes are also increasing, slowing down the availability of homes for sale. There may also be a psychological factor at play, with homeowners waiting to see if the market further improves before listing their homes.\n\nAnother factor affecting supply could be the affordability backdrop, which has made it challenging for individuals to move into larger and more expensive homes. This delay in move-up buying means that homeowners are staying in their current homes for longer periods, further limiting the availability of homes for sale.\n\nAs for the relationship between mortgage rates and housing prices, they are typically inversely related. When mortgage rates increase, housing prices tend to decrease. However, it's crucial to consider that mortgage rates are not the only factor influencing housing prices. The state of the job market, population growth, and housing supply all play a role.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, mortgage rates and housing prices rose simultaneously. This was due to the \"race for space\" phenomenon that occurred during the early stages of the pandemic. Urban dwellers in many Canadian cities started searching for detached, single-family homes, leading to increased demand and higher prices. The Bank of Canada responded by cutting interest rates, resulting in lower mortgage rates and further driving up housing prices.\n\nIn summary, while mortgage rates do have an impact on housing prices, they are just one piece of the puzzle.

Today, we bring you the inspiring journey of Sona Mehta, Senior Vice President of Canadian Personal Banking.\n\nSona's parents took a leap of faith when they immigrated to Canada from India in the late 1970s, searching for a better life. It wasn't easy, as they faced the familiar challenges of hope and struggle that many immigrants encounter. Sona's father, who was an engineer, initially faced difficulties finding work in his field due to employers preferring Canadian education and experience. To adapt, he humbly listed a grade 10 education on his resume so that he could secure factory jobs. Finally, he found a job and a place to live, and Sona and her mother joined him in Canada when she was just two years old.\n\nLeaving behind their extended family and everything they knew, Sona's mother, who held a master's degree in psychology, also took up sewing in a factory to make ends meet. It took time, but Sona's father eventually landed an engineering job, and the family was able to buy their first home. Sona's parents' sacrifices and determination have shaped her entire career, and she carries their story of resilience with her every day.\n\nNow, as the Senior Vice President of Canadian Personal Banking at TD, Sona draws on her personal experiences to make banking products and services better for all TD customers, including newcomers to Canada. She appreciates TD's strong commitment to diversity and inclusivity, values that brought her to the bank and have kept her here. Sona actively contributes to TD's culture of embracing diversity and inclusion through her involvement in the bank's pan-Asian Employee Resource Group (ERG), one of many ERGs throughout the organization.\n\nGrowing up in Brantford, Sona had a secure and joyful childhood. She fondly remembers her best friend who lived next door, and they would spend hours playing outside. Although she didn't have material luxuries, Sona cherished the special things her mother made for her, like bean bag stuffies and handmade dresses. However, despite these wonderful experiences, she always felt a sense of not belonging when she went to school.\n\n\"I didn't fit in,\" Sona recalls. \"At the time, I couldn't understand why. Was it because I was shy, or was it because I was one of the few South Asians in my school? All I knew was that I didn't belong.\" Looking back, she realizes that nothing can replace the feeling of being included and accepted. She considers this one of the most important lessons she has learned in life.\n\nAt TD, we celebrate individuals like Sona Mehta who have overcome challenges and found a sense of belonging. We strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued and included. Together, let's embrace diversity and make a positive impact in our communities. END"}

Picture this: a professional musician discovering new compositions without needing to touch an instrument. Or a small business owner effortlessly adding a perfect soundtrack to their latest Instagram video ad. That's the magic of Audiocraft - our cutting-edge AI tool that generates realistic, high-quality audio and music from simple text prompts.\n\nAudiocraft consists of three remarkable models: Musicgen, Audiogen, and Encodec. Musicgen, powered by both Meta-owned and specially licensed music, creates beautiful music based on text prompts. Audiogen, trained on public sound effects, generates various audio based on text prompts. Today, we are thrilled to release an enhanced version of our Encodec decoder, which ensures even higher quality music generation with minimal distortions.\n\nAdditionally, we are sharing our pre-trained Audiogen models. These models allow you to effortlessly create environmental sounds like a barking dog, honking cars, or footsteps on a wooden floor. But that's not all, we are also open-sourcing all Audiocraft model weights and code! This means researchers and practitioners now have access to train their own models with their own datasets for the first time, contributing to the advancement of AI-generated audio and music.\n\nWhile generative AI has made significant strides in images, video, and text, audio has been somewhat left behind. Existing work in this field is complex and not easily accessible to everyone. Generating high-fidelity audio requires modeling intricate signals and patterns of varying scales. Among all types of audio, music is particularly challenging as it encompasses both local and long-range patterns, from individual notes to a cohesive musical structure with multiple instruments.\n\nThe Audiocraft family of models tackles these challenges and delivers exceptional audio quality with consistency. Furthermore, these models are incredibly user-friendly. With Audiocraft, we simplify the design of generative models for audio, making it accessible for everyone. We are sharing the full recipe of the existing models developed by Meta over the past several years, empowering users to experiment and push boundaries by developing their own models.\n\nAudiocraft is your all-in-one solution, covering music, sound, compression, and generation. Its easily adaptable and reusable nature allows developers to build better sound generators, compression algorithms, or music generators on the same platform, leveraging the work of others. This solid open-source foundation fosters innovation and complements the future of audio and music production and listening.\n\nWith Audiocraft's expanded controls, we believe Musicgen can become a whole new type of instrument, much like the synthesizers when they first emerged. We see the Audiocraft family of models as tools that inspire and assist musicians and sound designers in brainstorming and iterating on their compositions in exciting new ways. We can't wait to witness the incredible creations that people will bring to life using Audiocraft! END"}

To ensure that everyone has a unique and personalized experience on our apps, we utilize AI systems to determine what content appears on their feeds, taking into account the choices they make.\n\nIn the past, we have discussed the relationship between you and the algorithms that shape your Facebook and Instagram experience. We want to dispel the misconception that algorithms render you powerless over the content you see. Instead, we believe in being frank and transparent about how this relationship works, and in giving you more control over your feed.\n\nToday, we are taking another step towards that commitment by providing greater transparency about the AI systems that use your feedback to rank content on Facebook and Instagram. These systems are designed to ensure that the posts you see are relevant and interesting to you. We are also making it easier for you to control what you see on our apps, as well as testing new features and improving accessibility. Additionally, we are providing detailed information for experts to better understand and analyze our systems. This is all part of our dedication to openness, transparency, and accountability.\n\nAs technology advances rapidly, we acknowledge that people are both excited about the possibilities and concerned about the risks, especially with powerful technologies like generative AI. In response, we believe that openness is key. We advocate for companies to be more transparent about how their systems work and to collaborate with industry, government, and civil society to ensure responsible development. And it starts with giving you more insight and control over the content you see.\n\nOur AI systems predict how valuable a piece of content might be to you, allowing us to show it to you sooner. For example, if you share a post, it indicates that you found it interesting, and our systems take that into account. However, no single prediction can perfectly gauge whether a post is valuable to you. Therefore, we utilize a variety of predictions, including behavior-based and survey-based feedback, to come as close as possible to providing the right content.\n\nWe are committed to being more open about how this prediction process works. We have been developing and advocating for a model of transparency, and we are proud to introduce system cards for Facebook and Instagram. These cards provide insights into how our AI systems rank content and the predictions they make to determine what content is most relevant to you. They also highlight the controls you can use to customize your experience. The system cards cover various features, such as feed, stories, reels, and recommendations for content from accounts or people you don't follow.\n\nIn addition to the system cards, we are sharing the types of signals, or inputs, and the predictive models that inform our AI systems in determining what content is most relevant to you on Facebook. These signals, which represent the majority of those used in the overall ranking process, can be found in the transparency center. We believe that providing this level of detail will help you better understand and engage with your Facebook network.\n\nOverall, our goal is to create a positive and engaging experience for you on Facebook and Instagram.

Today, as part of our quarterly integrity reporting, we want to share the progress we've made in combating various threats like covert influence operations, cyber espionage, and malware campaigns.\n\nIn my first year as meta's Chief Information Security Officer, my main focus has been bringing together teams from integrity, security, support, and operations. By collaborating effectively, we can address these challenges more efficiently. Each of these teams has been working tirelessly for many years, and we believe in the power of sharing progress, collaborating with external experts, and partnering with other companies to tackle industry-wide threats.\n\nFor over 10 years, our bug bounty program has been successfully working with the security research community. We have also been transparent about government data requests for the past decade. Additionally, we have shared takedowns of covert influence operations for more than five years and published our first community standards enforcement report five years ago. Through these initiatives, we have gained valuable insights and have learned the importance of sharing both qualitative and quantitative information about our integrity work. We are delighted to see other companies joining us in expanding their trust and safety reporting.\n\nWe are committed to continuing these efforts, and today's updates showcase our dedication. Countering malware campaigns across the internet is a priority for my teams. We actively track and take action against hundreds of threat actors worldwide, including those involved in malware campaigns. Here are some notable findings from our recent malware work:\n\nFirst, our threat research has repeatedly shown that malware operators, similar to spammers, exploit trendy topics to capture people's attention. Recently, we have noticed malware campaigns capitalizing on generative AI technology, which has fascinated and excited many. Since March, our security analysts have identified approximately 10 malware families masquerading as chatgpt and similar tools to compromise internet accounts. Some threat actors have even created malicious browser extensions available in official web stores, falsely claiming to offer chatgpt-related tools. Interestingly, some of these malicious extensions did include working chatgpt functionality alongside the malware. This tactic was likely intended to avoid suspicion from both the stores and users. To protect our users, we have detected and blocked over 1,000 unique malicious URLs from being shared on our apps. Additionally, we have reported these URLs to our industry peers at file-sharing services where the malware was hosted, so they can take appropriate action.\n\nThis trend is not exclusive to the generative AI space. As an industry, we have observed similar patterns with other popular topics, such as crypto scams driven by the interest in digital currency. The generative AI field is evolving rapidly, and bad actors are fully aware of it. Therefore, we must all remain vigilant.\n\nSecond, our collective efforts, along with those of the wider industry, have forced threat actors to rapidly adapt their tactics to escape detection and maintain their persistence. One strategy they employ is spreading their malicious activities across as many platforms as possible to prevent any particular service from effectively enforcing countermeasures. For instance, we have observed malware families exploiting platforms like ours and LinkedIn, popular browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox, link shorteners, and file-hosting services like Dropbox and Mega. When these actors are caught, they incorporate additional services, including smaller ones, to conceal the ultimate destination of their malicious links. Another example involves malware families posing as chatgpt apps, which switch their lures to other trendy themes like Google's Bard or TikTok marketing support in response to detection.\n\nIn conclusion, we want to assure our users and partners that meta remains committed to protecting your safety and security. We will continue to invest in innovative solutions and collaborate with experts and other companies to combat emerging threats. Together, we can create a safer digital environment for everyone. END"}

This week, the United States, Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, and Republic of Zambia are coming together to co-host the second Summit for Democracy. The aim of this summit is to unite the public and private sectors in advancing democracy, and we're thrilled to be a part of it.\n\nToday, we want to share with you our commitments to promote a positive impact through technology. First, we are taking a stand against surveillance-for-hire threats. Alongside industry leaders such as Microsoft, Cisco, and Trend Micro, we have published a set of principles and best practices to combat groups that harm people indiscriminately. These principles prioritize maintaining the integrity and security of our products and services, investing in cybersecurity awareness, and actively countering the cyber mercenary market. We have drawn on our extensive experience in countering these threats to develop these principles and are eager to collaborate with others to address this issue together.\n\nSecondly, we believe in enabling secure and private connections. We understand how crucial it is for people to access and share vital news and information without disruptions. That's why we have developed a feature that allows users to connect to WhatsApp through a proxy when their internet connection is blocked or disrupted. Additionally, we are committed to integrating end-to-end encryption into our messaging services to protect everyone's right to privacy. Upholding the fundamental human rights of all individuals, especially those who have historically been marginalized, is of utmost importance to us.\n\nAnother important commitment we have made is to counter government abuse of digital technology. We have invested significantly in protecting our systems from authoritarian governments that aim to surveil and target regime critics, opposition figures, and human rights defenders. When we identify such activity, we take immediate action, including blocking their domain infrastructure from our services and notifying those affected whenever possible.\n\nFurthermore, we are dedicated to respecting human rights and protecting human rights defenders. Through various forms of human rights due diligence, including product design and crisis management, we strive to prevent and mitigate risks to human rights. We will continue to support human rights defenders, both on our platform and through our product, policy, and operational interventions. Transparency and accountability are essential to us, and we adhere to the \"know and show\" principle outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We also actively support initiatives like the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Copenhagen Pledge on Tech and Democracy. By contributing to ongoing UN processes and collaborating with organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Internet Governance Forum, and Freedom Online Coalition, we aim to ensure that digital technologies work to uphold democracy and human rights.\n\nWe are excited about the progress we have made and the opportunities to collaborate with others in advancing democracy and protecting human rights. Together, we can create a positive impact and build a more inclusive and secure digital world. END"}

The main goals of this initiative are to make us a better technology company and improve our financial performance in a challenging environment so that we can execute our long-term vision.\n\nOur efficiency work consists of various parallel projects aimed at improving organizational efficiency, significantly increasing developer productivity and tooling, optimizing distributed work, eliminating unnecessary processes, and more. I believe in being transparent about the work in progress, and while I know that many of you are enthusiastic about these changes, I also understand that the idea of upcoming organizational changes can create uncertainty and stress.\n\nMy hope is to implement these organizational changes as soon as possible this year, so that we can overcome this period of uncertainty and focus on the crucial work ahead. Here's a timeline of what you can expect in the next few months:\n\n- Over the next couple of months, our organizational leaders will announce restructuring plans focused on streamlining our teams, cancelling lower-priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates.\n- Unfortunately, with less hiring, I have made the difficult decision to further reduce the size of our recruiting team. We will inform the impacted members tomorrow.\n- We anticipate announcing restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, followed by our business groups in late May. Please note that in some cases, these changes may take until the end of the year to complete.\n- Our timelines for international teams will differ, and local leaders will provide more details.\n\nIn total, we expect to reduce our team size by approximately 10,000 people and close around 5,000 additional open roles that we have not yet hired for. I understand that this will be challenging, and it means saying goodbye to talented and passionate colleagues who have contributed to our success. I am personally grateful for all their efforts, as they have dedicated themselves to our mission.\n\nWe will support affected individuals in the same way we have done in the past, and we will treat everyone with the gratitude they deserve. Once the restructuring is complete, we plan to lift hiring and transfer freezes within each group.\n\nIn addition to these efficiency measures, we have other important timelines to keep in mind. This summer, we aim to complete our analysis from our hybrid work year of learning, which will allow us to further refine our distributed work model. Throughout the year, we will also introduce a steady stream of developer productivity enhancements and process improvements.\n\nI want to reiterate that part of our efficiency work involves removing certain jobs, which is necessary to build a leaner, more technical company and improve our overall business performance. This is all in service of our long-term vision.\n\nI understand that this update may still come as a surprise, so I would like to provide some broader context on our vision, culture, and operating philosophy. Every day, Meta strives to build a better technology company that enables people to feel closer to each other. In today's complex world, this is a fundamental human need that we believe is more important than ever. We leverage advanced technologies, such as AI, the metaverse, encryption, and business tools, to create inspiring products that enhance people's lives, help them connect, and foster growth.\n\nSimply put, if you want to invent the future or apply the best ideas to reach people at an unprecedented scale, Meta is the best place for you.\n\nThank you for your continued dedication and support as we embark on this journey towards a more efficient and connected future.\n\nBest regards,\nMark Zuckerberg END"}

I'm Maxine Williams, Chief Diversity Officer, and I'm thrilled to share with you Meta's annual diversity report for 2022. Since 2014, we have been openly discussing our diversity metrics and our efforts to better support underrepresented individuals in our workforce and through our products. Today, we are excited to highlight some of our achievements and show you how we are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in our journey towards the metaverse.\n\nThe Impact of Remote Work on Diversity\n\nOur approach to work has evolved, and now, geography is no longer a barrier at Meta. Approximately 75% of our teams are spread across multiple locations. For the first time ever, we are hiring fully remote individuals, enabling us to broaden our candidate pool and enhance the diversity of our workforce. Over the past year, we have observed that:\n\n1. US candidates who accepted remote job offers were significantly more likely to be from underrepresented backgrounds such as Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, veterans, and\/or individuals with disabilities.\n2. Globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were more likely to be women.\n\nBut it's not just about bringing people on board; it's about ensuring their success and growth at Meta. That's why we continue to empower our employees with flexibility and benefits that cater to their evolving needs.\n\nInclusive Innovation for the Metaverse\n\nWe believe that building the metaverse—the next generation of digital experiences—requires collaboration with diverse companies, developers, experts, and policymakers right from the start. Here are a few examples of what we're doing:\n\n1. We offer over one quintillion different attribute combinations for Meta avatars, including various skin tones, facial shapes, and assistive devices like hearing aids and wheelchairs. Our goal is to make sure everyone feels represented and included.\n2. We understand that VR devices can be expensive for many, so we are developing a web-based version of Horizon Worlds that will allow more people to experience virtual reality using devices like smartphones.\n3. To support diverse creators, we are investing $150 million through Meta Immersive Learning and collaborating with partners to help them develop skills in areas like AR, VR, and immersive media. Our aim is to ensure creators from diverse backgrounds and perspectives can thrive in the metaverse and make a living from it.\n\nOur Workforce and Leadership Diversity Continue to Grow\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, we set ambitious goals to increase representation in our workforce over a five-year period, and I'm proud to say we have made significant progress. Let's take a look:\n\n1. 50-in-5 Update: We committed to doubling the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US and the number of women in our global workforce by 2024. Amazingly, we achieved and surpassed these goals for each group, two years ahead of schedule. We are now working on sustaining and improving these gains.\n2. We also challenged ourselves to ensure underrepresented individuals constitute at least 50% of our global workforce. As of June 30, 2022, individuals with disabilities represent 6.2% of our US workforce, up from 4.7% in 2021. Furthermore, veterans make up 2.3% of our US workforce, and members of the LGBTQ+ community account for 10.0%. Overall, underrepresented people make up 46.7% of our global workforce, up from 45.6% in 2021.\n3. 30-in-5 Update: In 2020, we set a target to increase the number of US-based leaders (director-level employees and above) who are people of color by 30%. I am delighted to share that through promotions and hiring, we are on track to not only achieve but potentially exceed our ambitious goal of increasing the representation of all people of color in leadership positions in the US by 30% by 2025. As an example, we have already achieved a 44.1% increase in black employee leadership since 2020.\n\nWe are proud of the progress we have made, but we know there is more work to be done. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive, and we will continue to push for greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of our work.\n\nTo delve deeper into our efforts, please take the time to read the full report. Thank you for joining us on this incredible journey as we build a metaverse that embraces and celebrates the richness of our diverse world. Together, we can create something truly amazing! END"}

As world leaders, advocates, and environmental groups gather in Glasgow for COP26, we believe it is crucial for bold action and strong commitments to be made to achieve net-zero targets and limit warming to 1.5 °C. We are determined to do our part.\n\nAs a global business that connects billions of people every month, we recognize our opportunity and responsibility to make a positive impact. We have already taken significant steps in reducing our environmental footprint. Since last year, we have achieved net-zero emissions for our global operations and have transitioned to 100% renewable energy. By making substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions – a remarkable 94% decrease since 2017 – we have demonstrated our commitment to sustainability.\n\nTo further contribute, we invest in wind and solar energy to cover all our operations. Additionally, we support projects that actively remove emissions from the atmosphere. We have also set ambitious goals for our suppliers to become net-zero and aim to restore more water than we use by 2030.\n\nSince 2013, we have contracted over seven gigawatts of new solar and wind energy, all within the same power grids as our data centers, which are renowned for their efficiency. We are also taking steps to reduce our business travel emissions and have joined the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance to help drive investment in sustainable aviation fuel, ultimately leading to net-zero air travel.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that we can do more. As a social media platform, we recognize the power of connecting people, amplifying voices, and sharing important information. Every day, we witness our users harnessing our services to raise awareness, organize for action, and bring attention to various environmental issues. We are committed to facilitating this positive impact by helping users access accurate, science-led information while combatting misinformation.\n\nThat is why we created the Climate Science Center on Facebook, connecting users with factual resources from leading climate organizations around the world. We are expanding this center to over 100 countries and introducing a new section that displays countries' greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to their commitments and targets, enabling users to better understand their country's progress and the work that lies ahead.\n\nFurthermore, we are adding informational labels to posts about climate change, directing users to the Climate Science Center for more information. These labels are now available in multiple countries, including Belgium, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and Taiwan.\n\nWe understand the importance of addressing climate change misinformation. That is why we collaborate with over 80 independent fact-checking organizations globally to review and rate content, including climate change-related content. When content is rated as false, we reduce its distribution and provide a warning label to offer more context. We also apply penalties to individuals who repeatedly share false information. In anticipation of COP26, we have activated a feature that assists fact-checkers in finding related content more efficiently, as swift action is crucial during significant events.\n\nTo learn more about our efforts in combatting climate change misinformation, please visit our website.

We have significantly increased our security and integrity workforce to over 40,000 people worldwide since 2016, and last year alone, we invested nearly $5 billion in these areas.\n\nTo effectively address the unique challenges in Brazil, we have a dedicated team of specialists based in the country who have a deep understanding of the situation. These efforts are further intensified as the election draws near, and we will continue to prioritize the integrity of our platforms even after the vote.\n\nOur actions to prevent election interference include removing content that violates our policies on voter suppression, such as posts that discourage people from voting. We also have strict measures in place to combat hate speech and the incitement of violence on our platforms.\n\nThanks to advancements in artificial intelligence, we are able to identify and remove 99.7% of fake accounts on Facebook before they are reported by users. We also actively investigate and disrupt networks that use coordinated fake accounts to manipulate public debate.\n\nAs the election approaches, we will establish an elections operations center focused on Brazil, where experts from various teams within our company will collaborate to identify potential threats in real time and respond promptly.\n\nIn partnership with Brazil's Superior Electoral Court (TSE), we have added labels to posts about political elections on Facebook and Instagram, directing people to reliable information on the electoral justice website. This initiative has already seen a significant increase in visits to the electoral justice portal.\n\nWe have also been proactive in promoting voter engagement. Through reminders on Facebook, we have encouraged users to request or update their voter cards, reaching the majority of adults in Brazil, and generating over three million clicks for more information. Closer to the election date, we will continue to display reminders on Facebook and Instagram to raise awareness among voters and reduce abstention rates.\n\nIn a new development, the TSE will be able to report content directly on Facebook and Instagram that may violate our policies. We will carefully analyze these reports upon receiving them.\n\nWhatsApp, too, has taken steps to ensure a fair electoral process. In the 2020 municipal election, WhatsApp launched an extrajudicial channel to receive complaints from the TSE and address potential cases of bulk messaging, which is prohibited by local electoral law and the app's terms of service. We have also developed a virtual assistant on WhatsApp in collaboration with the TSE, allowing voters to interact directly with the electoral authority and access relevant information about the vote.\n\nWe have actively engaged with electoral officials throughout Brazil, hosting training sessions to explain our efforts in combatting misinformation, providing insights into how Facebook and Instagram work, and outlining our content rules. Furthermore, we have also conducted workshops for candidates and their campaign teams.\n\nOur partnership with the TSE includes the distribution of informational booklets to the electoral community and a guide to combating online violence against women in politics, supported by the Women's Democracy Network (WDN) - Brazil chapter.\n\nAt Meta, we are committed to ensuring the integrity of Brazil's 2022 elections and will continue to work tirelessly to protect the democratic process and promote a safe and fair electoral environment.

That's why we are excited to introduce the National Registry of Physicians (NRP), a groundbreaking platform that will revolutionize the way medical information is shared and accessed.\n\nThe NRP will initially focus on facilitating information exchange among medical regulators, making the provision of medical care more streamlined and ensuring the highest standards of treatment for all Canadians. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we explore the many benefits the NRP will bring.\n\nIn October 2022, the Government of Canada approved our funding request under the Sectoral Workforce Solutions program. This funding will enable the MCC to establish the NRP, a visionary initiative that has garnered support from 12 provincial and territorial medical regulatory authorities (MRAs). We are thrilled to announce that the funding was officially approved on March 15, 2023.\n\nSince the announcement, we have been delighted to receive positive feedback from the medical community, with many inquiries about how the NRP aligns with the ongoing discussions on national or portable licensure. These inquiries highlight the significance of the NRP as a milestone in integrating health care data in Canada. It will serve as a vital resource for MRAs, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patients alike.\n\nCurrently, the NRP is under development with valuable input from a working group consisting of 18 members from MRAs across the country. Their insights are contributing to the creation of a national tool that meets provincial and territorial requirements while remaining accessible to everyone. The NRP will utilize critical data already collected by provinces and territories, making it an invaluable resource across jurisdictions.\n\nOnce completed, the NRP will be a comprehensive cloud-based database that provides information on all licensed physicians in Canada, including their credentials, education, and any disciplinary actions taken against them. The NRP will eliminate the need to gather files from multiple MRAs, simplifying the decision-making process and enhancing physician mobility.\n\nThe MCC's commitment to ensuring safe patient care is demonstrated through this initiative, leveraging our expertise in collaborative information exchange databases. As the dedicated agent for provincial and territorial entities, the MCC will facilitate seamless communication and the timely exchange of accurate data.\n\nThe NRP will be a dynamic and evolving database, regularly updated to reflect changes in the medical profession. Initially, it will be accessible to authorized users, starting with MRAs and expanding in the future to the public and other interested parties. Certain sections of the NRP will have restrictions in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of information.\n\nThis initiative represents a major step forward in the MCC's ongoing efforts to enhance health care delivery in Canada. By providing a comprehensive and accessible database of physician information, the NRP will empower MRAs, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patients to make more informed decisions, resulting in improved health outcomes for all Canadians.\n\nThe MCC is incredibly proud to lead this groundbreaking initiative and eagerly anticipates the positive impact it will have on the Canadian health care system for years to come.

These programs aim to address the shortage of primary care providers, with more than one in five adults lacking access to a doctor.\n\nOne proposed solution is to integrate more international medical graduates (IMGs) into the Canadian healthcare system through the PRA pathway. This pathway allows physicians who have completed their medical training and residency abroad to fast-track their licensure process.\n\nPRA programs are viewed as a safe and efficient way to bring qualified doctors into practice quickly and relieve the strain on the healthcare system. They are rapidly expanding, with increased funding from provincial governments in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. This funding allows these programs to scale up and place more doctors in communities where they are desperately needed.\n\nIn 2022, the Saskatchewan International Physician Practice Assessment (SIPPA) program increased its capacity, resulting in 45 family physicians completing the assessment compared to 36 in previous years. Similarly, the Practice Readiness Assessment - Alberta (PRA-AB) program saw a 35% increase in IMG enrollment for its preliminary clinical assessment in 2022, compared to the previous year.\n\nLooking ahead, Practice Ready Assessment - British Columbia (PRA-BC) will experience the most significant increase in capacity, nearly tripling the number of family medicine seats from 41 in 2023 to 96 in 2024. The program is actively planning for these changes and considering the operational adjustments necessary to accommodate this rapid growth.\n\nIt's important to note that increased funding is allowing these programs to bring more doctors into communities where they are greatly needed. The focus remains on providing safe and high-quality care to patients. In Alberta, the College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPSA) oversees all registration assessments, which ensures expertise and knowledge are utilized to maintain high standards.\n\nPRA-AB in Alberta launched a pilot project in January 2023 to streamline the assessment process for IMGs with training comparable to that of Canadian universities. This pilot waives the initial step of the process, allowing accelerated entry into the workforce while completing a supervised practice assessment. All candidates still undergo a competency assessment to ensure safe and high-quality patient care. Currently, there are 86 IMGs eligibles for this accelerated route.\n\nPRA-BC also emphasizes the importance of maintaining high quality in their program, particularly in terms of application criteria. While changes are on the horizon, they are committed to ensuring that applicants' clinical skills are not compromised. Instead, they aim to refine other areas such as post-program community support and customer service to make PRA-BC more attractive to skilled applicants.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the assessment process may vary across provinces, all PRA programs adhere to common standards and eligibility requirements established by the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) PRA framework. These standards guide program admissions and assessment decisions to ensure consistency and quality throughout the country. END"}

International medical graduates (IMGs) are an important part of Canada's physician workforce, especially in Saskatchewan, where half of our practicing doctors received their training internationally. Each year, approximately 75% of IMGs who start practicing in rural areas do so through the SIPPA program. This program offers an accelerated 12-week clinical assessment to ensure IMGs have the necessary clinical skills and knowledge to work effectively and safely in Canada.\n\nSince its establishment in 2011, the SIPPA program has successfully assessed 507 physicians. We highly value the role these graduates play in improving access to care in rural Saskatchewan, and the provincial government shares this sentiment. In the past two years, the Ministry of Health has generously provided funding to make significant improvements. We were able to increase the program's capacity from 36 to 45 participants annually in 2022. And in early 2023, we launched a program to support SIPPA participants even after their clinical assessment until they obtain full licensure.\n\nOur focus has always been on providing better care for patients, which is why SIPPA participants are welcomed and encouraged to work in rural and regional communities across Saskatchewan. We have been working hard to enhance the educational support available during their orientation and assessment period, with a particular emphasis on resources tailored to rural practice.\n\nDr. Jon Witt, SIPPA's medical director, explains that we have reviewed the outcomes of the assessment over the past two years to identify strengths and areas for improvement, especially related to emergency care. As a result, we have introduced new courses in advanced trauma life support, pediatric advanced life support, and approved airway management. Dr. Witt is confident that these additional resources will help SIPPA participants strengthen their skills and handle emergency situations with confidence. We have also seen increased support from various organizations, which now offer dedicated training to SIPPA participants.\n\nAs the number of IMGs opting for the program continues to rise, one of our main challenges is recruiting physician assessors. However, we are grateful for the commitment of our assessors who support the increased capacity and manage their own workload while ensuring robust assessments for participants. They have recognized the importance of providing comprehensive assessments to meet the needs of rural communities.\n\nTo provide ongoing support beyond the assessment period, SIPPA launched a post-assessment program in January 2023. Previously, supervision after the assessment was conducted through the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. The new program aims to follow physicians on their post-practice-ready assessment journey until they obtain full licensure. This is an expansion of the SIPPA program's continuum, as we understand that physicians do not finish the 12-week program fully equipped and ready to go. Learning, support, and coaching continue to be crucial during this time.\n\nWe have developed a curriculum that incorporates educational milestones from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, as well as feedback from past participants, family medicine leads, and chiefs of staff. This curriculum addresses knowledge and skill gaps identified during the transition into Canadian practice. In the first year post-assessment, physicians are actively engaged in a continuing education program, including simulations and weekly sessions on various clinical topics. We also cover subjects like patient and team communication, as well as personal wellness, to ensure a well-rounded approach to their development.\n\nIt is our mission to provide ongoing support and guidance to physicians as they embark on their careers in Saskatchewan's communities. Together, we can ensure that all patients receive the highest quality of care. END"}

We started with borrowing books from libraries and buying and reviewing them online. Now, we have the convenience of reading and highlighting on electronic reading devices like Kindle, which feel like books but can hold many titles without the weight. It did take some time for us to try and get comfortable listening to narrated audiobooks, and there are still some who resist this change. However, audiobooks have added a new dimension to reading, making it hands-free and introducing tonality.\n\nA quick search on Google for \"audible\" shows that even Google believes \"listening is the new reading.\" With that in mind, here are the five ways I believe audiobooks will continue to evolve:\n\n1) Narrator-less audiobooks: While driverless cars may grab all the attention, the closer reality is one where artificial intelligence gradually eliminates the need for human narrators. Robots have come a long way in sounding more human, and soon, the distinction between a computerized voice and a real human's voice will be unnoticeable. This change will lead to mass production of audiobooks, greater profit margins, and faster time to market.\n\n2) Increasing competition: Audiobooks are not just competing with books or e-books; they're competing with podcasts, music playlists, meditation apps, YouTube, phone calls, and even in-person conversations. Thanks to the popularity and convenience of Apple's AirPods, listening is on the rise, and the ambition of each audio app is growing. Just as Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime compete for screen time, podcasts, audiobooks, music apps, and phone calls will compete for \"eartime.\"\n\n3) Informative → Engaging: Some book or ebook readers hesitate to become audiobook listeners because they fear zoning out. To convert these readers, AI-generated narration will offer more customization options, from \"monotonous\" to \"dramatic\" and even \"rap music.\" Additionally, voice emulation will allow us to choose narrators from hundreds of voices, including celebrities or even grandpa\/ma.\n\n4) Convergence of media: It's not a black and white choice between reading and listening. Some people enjoy doing both simultaneously. Currently, book, ebook, and audiobook purchases for the same title are considered separate, potentially due to poor integration, revenue optimization, or the assumption that people exclusively choose one experience over the other. In the future, we can expect audiobooks to be bundled for free or at a nominal price with book and ebook purchases. Captions on audiobooks could become the new ebook. Audible is already working on two features to address this: immersion reading and audible captions.\n\n5) Auto-translation: Expanding the market isn't just about converting readers to listeners. There's a massive untapped audience worldwide who either don't prefer to read English or can't read at all. Making stories available in regional languages and accents presents a significant market opportunity, especially in the self-help category. Technology is the key to translating millions of books into over a thousand languages and various accents. Stories and knowledge can transform people's lives, regardless of whether they're an investment banker on Wall Street or a fruit seller in Asia. Imagine how real-time language translation with Google Pixel Buds could revolutionize travel!\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, please show it some love. Did I miss something?

Utilize a Chrome extension called New Tab Draft: This handy tool transforms your new tabs and windows into a notepad where you can type down your thoughts, reminders, and most importantly, your to-do list. Having your to-do list in a visible and easily accessible place serves as a constant reminder to stay focused and on track. It has been incredibly effective for me, especially since I do most of my work online. By making my to-do list the first thing I see when opening a new tab, it becomes nearly impossible to get distracted by social media or other unrelated tasks. This trick has proven to be helpful for people in various fields, such as startup founders, parents, office workers, and lawyers. The key is to avoid overwhelming your to-do list and instead focus on solving no more than three (preferably one) major task each day.\n\n2. Brainstorm ten ideas: This technique, inspired by renowned writer James Altucher, is a great way to boost your creativity. By challenging yourself to come up with ten ideas every day, you train your mind to think more innovatively. As a writer, I consistently practice this exercise. Though most of the topics I jot down may not be used, there is always one or two out of the ten that turn into incredible pieces. I highly recommend this exercise for everyone, even if you're not a writer. If you're a mom figuring out what to cook for dinner, try listing ten dishes. If you're a comedian, come up with ten jokes. If you're an artist, sketch ten quick drawings. The true value of generating ten ideas lies not only in boosting creativity but also in the idea that the more ideas you generate, the more good ideas you'll have.\n\n3. Turn off notifications and put your phone on silent: This may seem obvious, but many people still forget to do it at work. Social media, email alerts, and any kind of notification can be major distractions when trying to focus. Our minds are wired to feel a sense of accomplishment or excitement when we see those red badge numbers indicating a task completed or a message received. This feeling is due to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that makes us feel good. Disabling notifications is simple, as most phones have settings or apps to silence or disable them. Personally, I use the \"do not disturb\" feature on both my MacBook and iPhone. For notifications, I can't avoid, like those from Medium (since writing is my profession), I use a Chrome extension called Stylish. This extension allows me to hide notifications completely using CSS rules, but it requires a bit more technical knowledge.\n\nBy following these seven actions, you'll be well on your way to maintaining a productive and focused day, no matter your profession or responsibilities.

Some commonly used words around climate change can be problematic. Let's explore four of those words.\n\n1. Change: \"Climate change\" has become the go-to phrase for describing long-term shifts in weather and temperature caused by human-generated greenhouse gases. Previously, it was referred to as \"global warming.\" However, the term \"warming\" didn't accurately convey the full impact of this phenomenon, implying only temperature changes. The word \"change\" itself poses an issue because it is neutral. Change can be positive or negative, lacking urgency and failing to highlight the vast negative impacts of climate change. This neutrality can inadvertently support the narrative of climate skeptics, who claim that our planet's climate naturally fluctuates, and human activity has no role in the current increased temperatures. It's crucial to be aware of the connotations associated with \"change\" when discussing climate change.\n\n2. Believe: The question \"Do you believe in climate change?\" is frequently asked in various contexts, from social media threads to political debates. However, the problem lies in using the word \"believe.\" Climate change is not a matter of belief; it is a scientifically proven fact. 97% of research scientists agree that climate change is real, caused by human activity, and will have devastating consequences of we make immediate and drastic changes to our way of life. Belief has no place in conversations about climate change when scientific facts support its existence.\n\n3. Goals: Whether it's goals for achieving net-zero emissions or targets set by the Paris Agreement, headlines often focus on climate goals and the likelihood of missing them. These goals are crucial in addressing the climate emergency, but emphasizing facts, targets, and statistics can dehumanize the issue. Behind those goals are lives. If we fail to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050, we are jeopardizing the lives of those on the front lines of climate impacts and neglecting our responsibility to protect our fellow humans. It's easy to forget the human aspect of climate change when we solely discuss it in terms of goals and targets.\n\n4. Fight: Climate action and policy are often framed as a battle against \"climate change,\" portraying it as an external force overpowering us. However, it is humans who have caused climate change, and it is humans who have the power to stop it. It's not about \"defeating\" climate change's mighty force; the power lies in our hands. Specifically, it lies in the hands of oil and gas giants, who must cease extracting and burning fossil fuels to sustain our consumerist society, and politicians, who can enforce policies to hold them accountable.\n\nBy avoiding these four phrases in climate change conversations, we can foster a clearer, more relatable, and positive dialogue about the urgent action necessary to address the climate emergency.

In fact, some even describe the findings as \"spectacular\". The research was conducted by a team of doctors at Reina Sofía University Hospital in Córdoba, Spain.\n\nThe study involved 76 newly admitted COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups. One group received the standard treatment at the time, which included a combination of antibiotics and immunosuppressant drugs. The second group received the same standard treatment, along with a drug designed to boost vitamin D levels in the blood.\n\nThe results were remarkable. Among the 26 patients who received standard care alone, half ended up in the intensive care unit (ICU) as their condition worsened. Unfortunately, two of them died. However, among the 50 patients who received the additional vitamin D treatment, only one person required ICU care, and there were no deaths.\n\nThe Spanish researchers emphasized that their study was a preliminary one and further research is needed. However, they also pointed out that their findings add to existing evidence linking vitamin D to a reduced risk of severe respiratory infections. For example, Adrian Martineau, a clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, explains that vitamin D supports antiviral immune responses while reducing harmful inflammation. Although the evidence is not yet definitive, many studies suggest that low vitamin D levels may increase the risk of severe COVID-19.\n\nMartineau, who has conducted extensive research on the topic, including a review published in the BMJ, suggests that taking a daily or weekly vitamin D supplement, especially for those with low vitamin D levels, may reduce the risk of respiratory infections. While the direct link between vitamin D and protection against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is not yet proven, Martineau and others believe it is a possibility.\n\nThe Role of vitamin D in Combating COVID-19\n\nThanks to Martineau's work and research on vitamin D and respiratory infections, the \"sunshine vitamin\" has been a focus of COVID-19 studies since the beginning of the pandemic. During the spring, several groups found associations between low vitamin D levels and increased COVID-19 risks, and these findings have been replicated by other researchers. In a study published in PLOS ONE, researchers discovered a strong inverse association between blood levels of vitamin D and the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that sufficient vitamin D levels may help prevent infection and mitigate its severity.\n\nThere are several possible mechanisms by which vitamin D may provide these benefits. For example, vitamin D deficiency can impair the maturation of helpful white blood cells called macrophages, which play a vital role in clearing viruses from the body. Additionally, vitamin D may increase the levels of certain enzymes that help repel the coronavirus. Moreover, there is evidence that vitamin D may regulate elements of the immune system involved in the severe immune response associated with COVID-19.\n\nThe ways in which vitamin D may protect against SARS-CoV-2 are numerous and promising. While more research is needed, these findings offer hope for the potential role of vitamin D in combating COVID-19. END"}

Well, let's think about what all of this has to do with increasing the cattle population. The truth is, we live in a world that is facing many challenges. But our goal is to create a sustainable and desirable world, where we can live harmoniously with nature. Now, don't get me wrong, living in harmony with nature doesn't mean going back to the Stone Age. I truly believe that we can achieve this even in cities.\n\nHowever, in order for this vision to become a reality, we need a transition period. And the most crucial aspect of this transition is restoring the health of our planet's soil. For far too long, we have been degrading the soil by prioritizing maximum food production without considering the consequences for the land. This has led to significant damage, affecting both farmland and nature reserves all over the world.\n\nOne of the key issues is that the soil has become compacted, making it difficult for soil creatures to breathe and for water to be stored effectively. As a result, plants are unable to grow deep roots. In my work with farmers in the Netherlands, we emphasize the importance of preventing further compaction. We must stop using heavy tractors that compact the soil. Without addressing this issue, all other efforts to increase biodiversity will be in vain.\n\nThe next steps involve using natural manure to provide essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous to our soils. Additionally, we need to incorporate plenty of decomposing organic matter to build up humus, which is essential for a healthy topsoil. It is undeniable that our agricultural practices have played a significant role in degrading the land. However, mindful agriculture can also play a crucial role in restoring the soil's health.\n\nThis is where animals such as cattle, chickens, and pigs come into the picture. They are an integral part of the delicate balance of life. Cattle, with their hooves, naturally solve the issue of soil compaction through trampling. Chickens help by consuming maggots found in cattle manure, and pigs contribute by turning the soil with their snouts.\n\nAllan Savory advocates for holistic management, which involves increasing the number of cattle, chickens, and pigs that graze our grasslands, depositing manure, and trampling the soil. However, it is important to acknowledge that overgrazing has been a problem. But instead of reducing grazing altogether, Allan believes that the solution lies in intensifying the grazing process and allowing the land to rest for periods of time to facilitate natural plant growth cycles.\n\nI strongly agree with Allan's call for environmental organizations to collaborate with cattle in nature reserves to restore degraded soils. This approach is supported by permaculture expert Geoff Lawton, who adds valuable insights to Allan's ideas. It is crucial to assess each situation individually and determine the most effective methods of collaboration between humans and animals.\n\nIt's undeniable that animals play a vital role in maintaining a healthy planet. As for concerns about cattle emitting ammonia farts, healthy soil can absorb and mitigate this issue. The problem lies in the fact that our soil is no longer healthy. So, while I respect the choice of vegans, I personally believe that going vegan is not the sole solution to our problems.

This exclusive offer is only available in physical book form. And yes, it may appeal to a narrow audience, but that's what makes it so special. Only a select few can truly benefit from the information it contains. \n\nNow, I know this might seem counter-intuitive. How can a product that's hard to find, expensive, and appeals to a niche audience be successful? Well, here's the secret: by narrowing down the target audience to a specific group with specific needs and desires, we can tap into an underserved market. \n\nFor example, let's say you sell a course on dog training. In a saturated market, it's unlikely that you can charge a premium price for a book. But if you focus on a specific breed, like Catahoula Leopard Dogs, and even more specifically on training them for competitive dog shows, you've now tapped into a small but passionate audience. \n\nBy limiting the availability of the book and creating a sense of scarcity, we increase its desirability. It's like the first lesson in copywriting: scarcity drives up demand. And by offering additional bonuses along with the book, we enhance its perceived value. It's not just a book anymore, it's a whole package deal that's too good to pass up. \n\nBut the benefits don't stop there. By targeting a small audience, we can personalize our marketing message and truly understand their needs and challenges. It's like crafting a sales campaign tailored specifically to them. This level of personalization is simply impossible when targeting a larger, more diverse audience. \n\nAnd here's one more advantage: with a higher price point, we can afford to send handwritten thank you notes to every buyer. Try doing that with a cheap ebook! \n\nSo, would you consider investing in a book priced at $117? It's not just a book, it's a gateway to invaluable information that is hard to find elsewhere.

[7] moreover , benjamin noted that the ritualization of the mechanical reproduction of art also emancipated the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual , [7] thereby increasing the social value of exhibiting works of art a social and cultural practice that has progressed from the private sphere of life ( the owner ' s enjoyment of the aesthetics of the artefacts , usually high art ) to the public sphere of life , wherein the public enjoy the same aesthetics in a gallery displaying works of art . regarding the social functions of an artefact , benjamin said that works of art are received and valued on different planes . two polar types stand out with one , the accent is on the cult value with the other , on the exhibition value of the work . artistic production begins with ceremonial objects destined to serve in a cult . one may assume that what mattered was their existence , not their being on view .

[10] in practice , the diminished cult value of a religious artefact ( an icon no longer venerated ) increases the exhibition value of the artefact as art created for the spectators ' appreciation , because it is easier to exhibit a portrait bust , that can be sent here and there [to museums] , than to exhibit the statue of a divinity that has its fixed place in the interior of a temple . [11] the mechanical reproduction of a work of art voids its cult value , because removal from a fixed , private space ( a temple ) and placement in a mobile , public space ( a museum ) allows exhibiting the work of art to many spectators .

This means that artistic styles and cultural tastes evolve based on how humans perceive things. The medium in which art is created is influenced not only by nature but also by historical circumstances. Despite the negative effects of mass-produced art on the originality of a work, Benjamin believed that the uniqueness of art is closely connected to its place in tradition, which separates it from reproductions. Benjamin also pointed out that the ritualization of mechanical reproduction freed art from its dependence on rituals, increasing the social value of exhibiting artwork. This practice has evolved from being enjoyed privately by owners of high art to being appreciated by the public in galleries. \n\nBenjamin discussed the different ways in which works of art are received and valued. The two main types are cult value and exhibition value. When art is created for cult purposes, its existence matters more than its public display. Certain religious statues and sculptures are only accessible to priests or remain covered for most of the year. However, when the cult value diminishes, the exhibition value of the artwork as an object of appreciation for spectators increases. It is easier to exhibit a portrait bust in different museums than to display a temple statue with a fixed location. \n\nThe mechanical reproduction of art removes its cult value because it can be exhibited to many spectators in public spaces like museums, instead of being confined to a private, fixed location. Benjamin argued that the photographic image highlights the superiority of exhibition value over cult value. As a result, art takes on new functions that may not have been part of the original purpose for creating it.\n\nIn the medium of cinema, cult value is diminished because the audience identifies with the camera rather than the actors. This puts the audience in a position of being critical rather than reverential. The film allows the audience to step into the role of a critic effortlessly, without requiring their full attention.

{"prompt":"the term secular stagnation refers to a market economy with a chronic ( secular or long-term ) lack of demand . historically , a booming economy with low unemployment and high gdp growth ( i . e . , an economy at or above capacity ) would generate inflation in wages and products . however , an economy facing secular stagnation behaves as if it is operating below capacity , even when the economy appears to be booming inflation does not appear . in a healthy economy , if household savings exceed business investments , interest rates fall lower interest rates stimulate spending and investment , which bring savings and investments into balance . however , an economy facing secular stagnation may require an interest rate below zero to bring savings and investment into balance . the surplus of savings over investment may be generating price appreciation in financial assets or real estate . for example , the u . s . had low unemployment but low inflation in the years leading up to the great recession , although a massive housing bubble developed . [8] the idea of secular stagnation dates back to the great depression , when some economists feared that the united states had permanently entered a period of low growth . [9] the economist explained in 2018 that many factors may contribute to secular stagnation , by either driving up savings or reducing investment . households paying down debt ( i . e . , deleveraging ) increase savings and are spending less businesses react to the lack of demand by investing less . this was a major factor in the slow u . s . gdp growth during 2009-2012 following the great recession . another possible cause is income inequality , which shifts more money to the wealthy , who tend to save it rather than spend it , thus increasing savings and perhaps driving up financial asset prices . aging populations ( which spend less per capita ) and a slowdown in productivity may also reduce investment . central banks face a difficult dilemma do they raise interest rates to ward off inflation ( e . g . , implement monetary policy austerity ) assuming the economy is in a cyclical boom , or assume the economy ( even if temporarily booming ) is in secular stagnation and therefore take a more stimulative approach ? an analysis of stagnation and what is now called financialization was provided in the 1980s by harry magdoff and paul sweezy , coeditors of the independent socialist journal monthly review . magdoff was a former economic advisor to vice president henry a . wallace in roosevelt’s new deal administration , while sweezy was a former harvard economics professor . in their 1987 book , stagnation and the financial explosion , they argued , based on keynes , hansen , michał kalecki , and marx , and marshaling extensive empirical data , [citation needed] that , contrary to the usual way of thinking , stagnation or slow growth was the norm for mature , monopolistic ( or oligopolistic ) economies , while rapid growth was the exception . [10] private accumulation had a strong tendency to weak growth and high levels of excess capacity and unemployment\/underemployment , which could , however , be countered in part by such exogenous factors as state spending ( military and civilian ) , epoch-making technological innovations ( for example , the automobile in its expansionary period ) , and the growth of finance . [11] in the 1980s and 1990s magdoff and sweezy argued that a financial explosion of long duration was lifting the economy , but this would eventually compound the contradictions of the system , producing ever bigger speculative bubbles , and leading eventually to a resumption of overt stagnation . ->","completion":" The term secular stagnation refers to a situation in the market where there is a long-term lack of demand. In the past, when the economy was doing well with low unemployment and high GDP growth, inflation would typically occur in wages and products. However, in a case of secular stagnation, it seems like the economy is booming, but it is actually operating below its full capacity, and inflation does not appear. In a healthy economy, if household savings are higher than business investments, interest rates would decrease, stimulating spending and investment and bringing savings and investments into balance. However, in a case of secular stagnation, an interest rate below zero may be needed to balance savings and investment. The surplus of savings overinvestment could potentially cause price appreciation in financial assets or real estate. For example, before the great recession, the United States had low unemployment but low inflation, yet there was a massive housing bubble. The concept of secular stagnation originated during the great depression when economists were concerned that the United States was permanently stuck in a period of low growth. According to The Economist in 2018, several factors can contribute to secular stagnation by either increasing savings or reducing investment. When households pay off debt and spend less, savings increase. Businesses also invest less due to the lack of demand. This was a major reason for the slow GDP growth in the United States from 2009 to 2012 following the great recession. Income inequality is another possible cause, as it leads to more savings among the wealthy who tend to save rather than spend, potentially driving up financial asset prices. Aging populations, with lower per capita spending, and a slowdown in productivity may also decrease investment. Central banks face a difficult decision: should they raise interest rates to prevent inflation assuming the economy is in a temporary boom, or should they take a more stimulating approach, considering the possibility of secular stagnation? In the 1980s, Harry Magdoff and Paul Sweezy, coeditors of the independent socialist journal Monthly Review, analyzed stagnation and what is now known as financialization. They argued, based on the ideas of Keynes, Hansen, Michał Kalecki, and Marx, along with extensive empirical data, that stagnation or slow growth is the usual state for mature monopolistic or oligopolistic economies, while rapid growth is the exception. Private accumulation tends to result in weak growth and high levels of excess capacity and unemployment\/underemployment, although this can be partially offset by factors such as state spending, technological innovations, and the growth of finance. In the 1980s and 1990s, Magdoff and Sweezy predicted that a long-lasting financial explosion would boost the economy, but eventually, it would worsen the system's contradictions, leading to larger speculative bubbles and eventually a return to stagnation.

{"prompt":"many theoretical and empirical analyses of economic growth attribute a major role to a country ' s level of human capital , defined as the skills of the population or the work force . human capital has been included in both neoclassical and endogenous growth models . [51][52][53] a country ' s level of human capital is difficult to measure since it is created at home , at school , and on the job . economists have attempted to measure human capital using numerous proxies , including the population ' s level of literacy , its level of numeracy , its level of book production\/capita , its average level of formal schooling , its average test score on international tests , and its cumulative depreciated investment in formal schooling . the most commonly-used measure of human capital is the level ( average years ) of school attainment in a country , building upon the data development of robert barro and jong-wha lee . [54] this measure is widely used because barro and lee provide data for numerous countries in five-year intervals for a long period of time . one problem with the schooling attainment measure is that the amount of human capital acquired in a year of schooling is not the same at all levels of schooling and is not the same in all countries . this measure also presumes that human capital is only developed in formal schooling , contrary to the extensive evidence that families , neighborhoods , peers , and health also contribute to the development of human capital . despite these potential limitations , theodore breton has shown that this measure can represent human capital in log-linear growth models because across countries gdp\/adult has a log-linear relationship to average years of schooling , which is consistent with the log-linear relationship between workers ' personal incomes and years of schooling in the mincer model . eric hanushek and dennis kimko introduced measures of students ' mathematics and science skills from international assessments into growth analysis . they found that this measure of human capital was very significantly related to economic growth . eric hanushek and smith have extended this analysis . theodore breton shows that the correlation between economic growth and students ' average test scores in hanushek and wößmann ' s analyses is actually due to the relationship in countries with less than eight years of schooling . he shows that economic growth is not correlated with average scores in more educated countries . [55] hanushek and smith further investigate whether the relationship of knowledge capital to economic growth is causal . they show that the level of students ' cognitive skills can explain the slow growth in latin america and the rapid growth in east asia . joerg baten and jan luiten van zanden employ book production per capita as a proxy for sophisticated literacy capabilities and find that countries with high levels of human capital formation in the 18th century initiated or participated in the industrialization process of the 19th century , whereas countries with low levels of human capital formation were unable to do so , among them many of today ' s less developed countries such as india , indonesia , and china .

[62] mortality decline triggers greater investments in individual human capital and an increase in economic growth . matteo cervellati and uwe sunde[63] and rodrigo . r soares[64] consider frameworks in which mortality decline has an influence on parents to have fewer children and to provide quality education for those children , as a result instituting an economic-demographic transition . ->","completion":" Many studies on economic growth emphasize the significant role of a country's human capital, which refers to the skills of its population or workforce. Both neoclassical and endogenous growth models incorporate human capital. However, measuring a country's level of human capital is challenging as it is developed at home, in schools, and through work experience.\n\nEconomists have attempted to measure human capital using various indicators, such as literacy rates, numeracy skills, book production per person, average years of formal education, international test scores, and investment in formal education. The most commonly used measure is the average years of schooling, thanks to the data provided by Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee, who offer comprehensive information on numerous countries over a long period of time.\n\nIt is important to note that the level of human capital acquired from a year of schooling differs across levels and countries. Additionally, human capital is not solely developed through formal education but also influenced by families, neighborhoods, peers, and health. Despite these limitations, Theodore Breton demonstrates that the average years of schooling can still be used as a measure of human capital in log-linear growth models. This is supported by the log-linear relationship between workers' incomes and years of schooling in the Mincer model.\n\nFurther research by Eric Hanushek and Dennis Kimko reveals a strong correlation between students' mathematics and science skills and economic growth. They also find that students' cognitive skills can explain the differences in growth rates between Latin America and East Asia. However, Theodore Breton argues that this correlation is only present in countries with less than eight years of schooling, and there is no significant relationship in more educated countries.\n\nJoerg Baten and Jan Luiten van Zanden use book production per person as a proxy for advanced literacy capabilities. They discover that countries with high levels of human capital formation in the 18th century were able to initiate or participate in the industrialization process of the 19th century. On the other hand, countries with low levels of human capital formation, including present-day less developed countries like India, Indonesia, and China, were unable to do so.\n\nIn the context of health, it is essential to consider the broader perspective outlined by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's capability approach. Health should not be solely defined as the absence of illness but as the opportunity for individuals to fully develop their biological potential throughout their lives. It is well established that human capital is a valuable asset for economic growth, but its contribution can only be realized if the population is healthy and well-nourished. The mortality rate, for example, plays a crucial role in determining the labor supply in developing economies. A decline in mortality rates leads to increased investments in individual human capital and ultimately results in higher economic growth.\n\nMatteo Cervellati and Uwe Sunde, as well as Rodrigo R. Soares, propose frameworks that link declining mortality rates to reduced fertility rates and the provision of quality education for children. This leads to an economic-demographic transition, which can positively impact a country's economic growth. END"}

Today's chemists are confident that future generations will know even more than they do.\n\nIn the past, the history of science was often seen as a steady accumulation of knowledge, where true theories replaced false beliefs. However, some more recent interpretations propose that science is composed of competing paradigms within a larger framework of intellectual, cultural, economic, and political trends. While these interpretations have faced opposition, as they suggest that there is no real progress in science, only the illusion of progress, the debate continues.\n\nIt's also debatable whether other disciplines, like history and philosophy, make progress in the same way as the sciences. For example, historians today probably know more about global history than their ancient counterparts, but knowledge can be lost over time or our evaluation criteria can change. Philosophy also invites disagreement on whether it aims to accumulate knowledge like the sciences.\n\nWhen it comes to social progress, increases in GDP often contribute positively, but there are other factors to consider too. If there's an imbalance between economic and social progress, it can hinder further economic growth and even lead to political instability. Countries that fail to address human needs, build social capital, and create opportunities for their citizens experience slower social progress, which in turn affects their economic growth.\n\nIn Italy, the belief that progress in science and technology would provide solutions for societal issues was strongly tied to the nationalism that brought the country together in 1860. The prime minister at the time, Camillo Cavour, saw railways as a crucial element in modernizing and unifying the Italian peninsula. With the formation of the new kingdom of Italy in 1861, efforts were made to accelerate modernization and industrialization in the north, while also addressing the slower progress in the central and southern regions. The government aimed to combat backwardness in the south, strengthen the Italian army, and improve public education to tackle illiteracy and promote the physical and moral well-being of the people.

Europe's numerous peninsulas and natural barriers, such as mountains and straits, provided defensible borders and encouraged the formation of separate political entities. On the other hand, China's geography promoted political unity, with a smoother coastline and a heartland dominated by two river valleys.\n\nThe topographical structure of Europe, with its mountain ranges, coasts, and marches, created distinct geographical cores that could serve as the foundations for future states. Additionally, the location of the Eurasian steppe posed a threat to sedentary populations in Europe due to the mobility of steppe nomads. This threat stimulated European countries to build strong and unified states to protect themselves.\n\nIn his book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\" Diamond argues that advanced cultures outside Europe developed in areas that allowed for large, isolated empires. These conditions often led to technological and social stagnation. For example, China, which was a global leader in shipbuilding in 1432, outlawed the construction of ocean-going ships. In contrast, European rulers like Queen Isabella I of Castile sponsored Christopher Columbus's expedition, which ultimately led to significant economic and technological progress. Governments that hindered progress soon realized their mistakes or were out-competed.\n\nJustin Yifu Lin proposes that China's large population size was beneficial for technological advancements before the 14th century. However, population size was not a crucial factor for the kind of technological advancements that sparked the industrial revolution. Early advancements relied on learning through practical experience, which could spread over a large political unit. In contrast, the industrial revolution stemmed from experimentation and theory, making population size less important.\n\nBefore Europe began making strides in technology and trade, there was a disparity in the importance of education. By 1800, literacy rates in the Netherlands were 68%, while in Britain and Belgium, they were at 50%. In non-European societies, literacy rates only began to rise in the 20th century. As the industrial revolution progressed, the focus shifted to factors that influenced worker productivity, such as education, training, skills, and health.\n\nEconomic historian Joel Mokyr argues that Europe's political fragmentation allowed for the flourishing of diverse ideas. Entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues, and heretics could easily move to a neighboring state if their ideas and activities were suppressed. This set Europe apart from large empires like China, which had advanced technologies like the printing press and movable type but did not experience an industrial revolution.

Even though there have been moments of concern about one country dominating or annexing the other, we have always managed to maintain peaceful relations.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, many loyalists found a new home in Canada. Since then, there have been occasional border invasions, but the war of 1812 marked the end of any attempts to change the borders. In fact, the demilitarization of the border and the Great Lakes region helped solidify the peaceful nature of our relationship. The British also stopped aiding Native American attacks on the United States, and there have been no further attempts to invade Canada, except for minor unsuccessful raids.\n\nAs Britain started to disengage, fears of the United States taking over played a role in the Canadian Confederation in 1867 and the rejection of free trade in 1911. However, our military collaboration has been strong, especially during World War II and the Cold War, with close bilateral cooperation through NORAD and multilateral collaboration through NATO.\n\nToday, there is a high volume of trade and migration between our two nations, as well as a significant overlap of popular and elite culture. This has brought us even closer together, particularly after the signing of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988. In fact, our border, which spans 8,891 kilometers (5,525 miles), is not only the longest between any two nations but also symbolizes the deep connection we share.\n\nDespite some challenges such as trade disputes, environmental concerns, and debates over oil exports, illegal immigration, and terrorism, our trade relationship continues to flourish. The signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2020 further merged our economies and facilitated the flow of goods, services, and people across our borders.\n\nMoreover, there have been efforts to enhance cooperation even more, such as establishing joint border inspection agencies, relocating food inspectors, sharing intelligence, and harmonizing regulations. These actions strengthen the American-Canadian alliance and simplify cross-border interactions.\n\nWhile our foreign policies have been closely aligned since the Cold War, both countries maintain their independence. Additionally, there is an ongoing diplomatic debate regarding the Northwest Passage and whether it falls under international waters or Canadian sovereignty.\n\nAlthough there have been some disputes in the past, like the Alaska Boundary Dispute settled in favor of the United States in 1903, we have managed to overcome them. This controversy arose during the Klondike Gold Rush when Canada claimed the legal right to a port near the American town of Haines, Alaska, for an all-Canadian route to the goldfields. The arbitration resolved the issue and maintained the status quo, but it left Canada feeling frustrated with Britain, who seemed to prioritize its relations with the United States over those with Canada.\n\nTo prevent future misunderstandings, the International Boundary Waters Treaty was signed in 1909, and the International Joint Commission was established to manage the Great Lakes and keep them disarmed. This treaty was later amended during World War II to allow the construction and training of warships.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between Canada and the United States is a remarkable example of cooperation, friendship, and interconnectedness. We have overcome challenges, expanded trade, and deepened our cultural bonds over time. As we continue to work together, we are confident that our partnership will only grow stronger. END"}

His main goal is to increase participation in the sport at all levels, and he has been pleased to see signs of growth recently. Reagins believe that when people have a positive experience with baseball, they are more likely to become fans. Social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube have played a big role in expanding the sport's audience. MLB has recognized that today's younger generation has shorter attention spans, so they have introduced new rules to speed up the pace of play, such as the pitch clock. As a result, the average game time this season is now 2 hours and 38 minutes, compared to 3 hours and 3 minutes last season and 3 hours and 10 minutes in 2021. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has noticed that the median age of ticket-buyers has dropped from 46 to 43 years old, showing that younger audiences are becoming more interested in the game. TV viewership among teens ages 12-17 has increased by 11% from last year, and 86% of people ages 18-24 and 25-34 are more likely to watch MLB games due to the rule changes. Overall, baseball parks have seen a 9% increase in average attendance this season, and total attendance is already 4.38 million higher than in 2022. Reagins understand that young people now consume baseball in shorter bursts, so MLB is adjusting its strategies to attract new fans. The important thing is that they are still engaging with the game in some way. However, the focus on highlight reels may have slightly weakened the connection between young fans and the loyalty to their home team. For example, 12-year-old Grayson Leinart from Waco, Michigan, enjoys watching highlights because they are more exciting to him, even though the Milwaukee Brewers are his favorite team. Many young fans at the Little League World Series are also watching highlights on their phones while attending games. Despite this, MLB players recognize the importance of connecting with young fans. Nationals first baseman Dominic Smith, who is involved in a nonprofit organization that supports underprivileged youth in baseball, believes that spending time with major-leaguers helps kids understand that they are just regular people with similar interests. This motivates them to work hard and aspire to reach the big leagues. Washington Nationals manager Dave Martinez, who grew up playing stickball in New York, is excited to connect with the next generation of baseball fans during his trip to Williamsport. He wants to understand what drives kids these days and why they love the game. Perhaps Martinez can share his insights with MLB's decision-makers. END"}

What they may not have realized is that this was due to COVID-19 outbreaks among migrant farmworkers across Canada, including in Southern Ontario. These outbreaks and their impact on our food supply, show us just how important and vulnerable these workers are. Many of them come to Canada through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, which is set to be changed this September.\n\nThe program allows employers to hire foreign workers when no qualified Canadians are available. It has become very popular, with a significant increase in successful applications in recent years. However, along with this popularity has come accusations of abuse. Many workers endure unsafe working and living conditions, with long hours, low pay, and limited benefits. They often live in crowded quarters provided by their employers, sharing sleeping and bathroom facilities. These conditions increase the risk of disease outbreaks and other health threats.\n\nFor the well-being of these workers, it is crucial for the government to ensure that changing the program does not lead to more abuse. The federal government insists that the alteration, known as the Recognized Employer Pilot, will actually do the opposite. Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault says that the pilot will reduce the administrative burden on employers who demonstrate the highest level of worker protection. It will also allow them to have permits lasting three years instead of the current 18 months. The change will first apply to employers in agriculture, and then to all others starting in January.\n\nRewarding responsible employers could help protect workers and make the paperwork process easier. Ottawa has also promised to conduct more rigorous assessments before issuing permits. However, three years is a long time, and it is enough for working and living conditions to deteriorate significantly. Government inspectors do monitor employers' compliance with regulations, but their oversight has been inadequate. In response to COVID outbreaks among farmworkers, the federal auditor general criticized inspectors for not ensuring that employers followed regulations. Therefore, if the pilot program is to succeed, it must be accompanied by improved and vigilant monitoring of employers' compliance with safety standards throughout the three-year period.\n\nHowever, even with better monitoring, it won't solve the problem that allows abuse to occur - the power imbalance between employers and workers. This stems from two factors: employer-specific work permits and the tenuous immigration status of the workers. Employer-specific permits require workers to stay with the employer who hired them. This leaves some workers with the impossible choice of enduring abuse or facing unemployment. Ottawa introduced the Vulnerable Worker Open Work Permit Program to address this issue, allowing abused workers to move to a different employer. Unfortunately, many workers are reluctant to complain because they fear deportation or retaliation from their employers. Additionally, the program only grants open permits to those who have already experienced abuse, treating it as a kind of initiation that workers must endure to gain better opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, it is vital to recognize the challenges faced by migrant farmworkers and take steps to protect their rights and well-being. Changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program should be accompanied by strict monitoring of employers' compliance with safety standards. Efforts should also be made to address the power imbalance between employers and workers, ensuring that workers have the freedom to speak up without fear of reprisals. By valuing and protecting these workers, we can create a fairer and more positive environment for everyone involved. END"}

After adjusting for seasonal changes, the index for July rose by 2.4% from June, marking the fourth consecutive monthly increase. This rise in home prices has helped to offset some of the declines that occurred earlier this year when the higher rate environment deterred some buyers, as mentioned in the report. Douglas Porter, the Chief Economist of the Bank of Montreal, stated that the significant declines seen throughout 2022 are now being reversed.\n\nAlthough the Teranet-National Bank index tends to lag behind other housing market measures due to its detailed nature, there are indications that the market is starting to soften over the summer. Porter believes that this softening will also become evident in this index going forward. He suggests that this may be the last period of significant growth in home prices for a while. However, there was positive news regarding July home sales, which experienced their largest annualized increase in over two years, as reported by the Canadian Real Estate Association. Although sales remained relatively unchanged from June, this stability indicates signs of the housing market stabilizing this summer.\n\nNational Bank of Canada economist Daren King wrote in the report that prices could continue to rise in the third quarter of the year, supported by strong demographic growth and low supply. However, King also notes that affordability may deteriorate due to recent interest rate hikes and a less buoyant economic context, which could pose a challenge to house prices. Porter agrees with King's assessment, adding that the housing market will face more challenges as the year progresses. Nevertheless, he believes that high immigration rates will help support prices.\n\nPorter also mentioned that expectations for interest rates suggest that they will remain higher for longer, which could be a pressure point for the housing market in the long term. Although mortgage interest costs contribute to the consumer price index, Porter highlighted that this is an \"unfortunate side effect\" of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. He emphasized the importance of considering the overall picture, noting that inflation and underlying inflation have decreased over the past year.\n\nIn July, eight out of the 11 markets in the Teranet-National Bank Composite Index experienced price increases, with Halifax showing the highest increase at 4.9%. Vancouver recorded a gain of 3.9%, while Toronto saw an increase of 3.5%. On the other hand, prices declined by 1.2% in Quebec City, 0.9% in Montreal, and 0.3% in Calgary.

( one of these discount airlines is flair itself , which had just three aircraft at the start of 2021 but has expanded to a fleet of 21 boeing 737s , offering service to over 30 cities across canada , the u . s . and mexico . ) but the covid-19 pandemic exacerbated airlines’ already existing labour challenges , delaying and disrupting pilot training across the country while also driving experienced pilots to exit the industry in favour of more job stability elsewhere . international consultancy firm oliver wyman has estimated that the north american aviation industry could be short 30 , 000 pilots by 2032 if nothing changes . “what that means , in my opinion , is it’s the perfect time to introduce a program where we do targeted training to train exactly what we want , how we want , to get the quality that we want for our pilots , ” said grey cooper , manager of pilot training at flair . while transport canada regulations require a candidate to have at least 250 hours of flying time to qualify for an airline transport pilot license , traditionally , most pilots being hired by major airlines have had far more than that . in fact , cooper said commercial pilots often spent years flying small planes on regional and northern routes before ever graduating to big jets . “there was more supply than demand for airline pilots . you could end up sitting on a smaller airplane for multiple years before you got the opportunity , ” he said . but as pilots become harder and harder to come by , airlines have begun hiring people with less experience — as little as two years flying smaller planes now as opposed to the five or 10 it used to take to get hired as an airline jet pilot , cooper said . he added flair’s program meets all of transport canada’s regulatory requirements and will adhere to the highest industry standards for training and safety . in addition to pre-screening applicants for aptitude and competence before they ever enter the program , flair has also partnered with technology company cts aero to incorporate state-of-the-art virtual reality tools and flight simulators into the program , cooper said . while flair is the first to pioneer the concept in canada , cooper said european airlines have many programs that take people with no experience and equip them to get jobs on boeing 737 and airbus a320 jets immediately upon completion . “we’re taking proven systems that have worked worldwide and are applying them to canada , ” he said . flair said it will accept its first cohort of 10 aspiring pilots in january 2024 . students accepted into the program will receive a conditional offer of employment with the airline and transition directly into the airline upon graduation . ->","completion":" Flair Airlines, a Canadian discount carrier, is addressing the pilot shortage in North America with an innovative training program. This program will fast-track candidates, even those with no flying experience, into the cockpits of Flair Airlines' jets. In partnership with Genesis Flight College, Flair will offer the new airline pilot training program in Collingwood, Ontario. The program aims to significantly reduce the time it takes for new pilots in Canada to secure jobs flying large commercial jets.\n\nUpon entering the program, candidates will undergo 18 months of training and become qualified first officers on Flair Airlines' fleet of Boeing 737 Max aircraft. This initiative comes at a crucial time as a pilot shortage has been a growing concern due to factors such as an aging workforce and the rise of new discount airlines. Flair Airlines itself, which started 2021 with only three aircraft, has expanded to operate a fleet of 21 Boeing 737s, serving over 30 cities across Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the labor challenges faced by airlines. Pilot training has been delayed and disrupted, leading experienced pilots to seek more job stability in other industries. If no action is taken, the North American aviation industry could potentially face a shortage of 30,000 pilots by 2032, according to Oliver Wyman, an international consultancy firm.\n\nGrey Cooper, the manager of pilot training at Flair, believes that now is the perfect time to introduce a targeted training program to ensure the quality and suitability of pilots. While Transport Canada regulations typically require candidates to have a minimum of 250 hours of flying time to obtain an airline transport pilot license, major airlines have traditionally preferred candidates with much more experience. However, due to the scarcity of pilots, airlines are now hiring individuals with as little as two years of experience flying smaller planes, rather than the previously required five to ten years of experience.\n\nFlair's program not only meets all of Transport Canada's regulatory requirements but also adheres to the highest industry standards for training and safety. Before entering the program, applicants will undergo thorough screening to assess their aptitude and competence. Flair has also partnered with technology company CTS Aero to incorporate cutting-edge virtual reality tools and flight simulators into the training program.\n\nAlthough Flair is the first in Canada to pioneer this concept, similar programs have proven successful in Europe, where individuals with no prior experience can secure jobs flying Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 jets immediately after completing the training. By adopting these proven systems, Flair aims to meet the growing demand for pilots in Canada.\n\nFlair plans to accept its first group of ten aspiring pilots in January 2024. Students accepted into the program will receive a conditional offer of employment from the airline and seamlessly transition into their roles upon graduation. END"}

It seemed like an unpredictable event, similar to another incident in 2016 when a fallen tree branch claimed a man's life in the same park. But what if these deaths weren't unavoidable? What if they were the result of ongoing mismanagement? In other words, what if the city isn't doing a great job of maintaining the vast tree canopy we have?\n\nThese are questions that arborists and tree experts have been asking for years, and they've resurfaced in the aftermath of Nadimi's tragic death. Could this have been prevented if the city had properly assessed the trees in Trinity Bellwoods Park? Recent reporting by Ben Spurr from The Star reveals concerning details about the city's tree maintenance program. Months before Nadimi's accident, a concerned resident had alerted city workers twice about the potential danger posed by the very branch that would later fall and take her life. After the incident, the tree was finally removed. City staff then identified 16 more trees for removal in the park, and 21 trees received maintenance, including pruning.\n\nThe city claims that they receive 40,000 calls related to tree maintenance annually, conduct over 25,000 inspections, and prune more than 20,000 trees. However, multiple arborists interviewed by Spurr pointed out various issues with the city's forestry practices, ranging from outdated assessment methods to excessive pruning of mature trees. Arborist and urban forestry educator Todd Irvine expressed concern over certain trees being pruned in a way that doesn't adhere to recognized arboricultural standards, potentially affecting their health and structural integrity.\n\nOver-pruning, also known as \"lion's tailing,\" which involves thinning interior branches and leaving most of a tree's foliage at the ends of its branches, weakens trees and makes them more susceptible to dropping limbs during storms. However, not all arborists agree that this was the primary issue in Nadimi's case. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conclude that the city needs to reassess its tree maintenance practices, considering recent events. With an estimated 4.1 million trees on public land and another 6.1 million on private properties, it's crucial to prioritize the proper care of Toronto's trees. This tragedy emphasizes the importance of tending to tree, particularly as we face increasingly severe storms due to climate change. In 2022, the city witnessed a significant rise in storm-related calls, reaching 12,701 compared to just under 8,000 in 2020 and 2021.\n\nInvesting in the appropriate maintenance of Toronto's trees is not only essential for the environment but also for the safety of everyone who enjoys our city parks and cherishes the shade and beauty of majestic trees.

They pointed out that Canada failed to learn from experiences and investigations, leaving the most vulnerable individuals, such as those in long-term care homes and marginalized communities, to suffer the most. The country's response was uncoordinated and did not live up to its promises of sharing vaccines with the world. The journal expressed disappointment rather than anger, stating that the world had higher expectations for Canada.\n\nAs of July 18, more than 53,000 Canadians had lost their lives to the virus, with lower-income individuals experiencing higher mortality rates. The report emphasized that only the public's willingness to accept lockdown measures and the country's high vaccination coverage saved Canada from greater calamity. Canadian researchers who authored the series called for an independent national inquiry into the COVID-19 response. Many Canadians agree, as polls suggest, although some may be hesitant due to previous delays and complications surrounding inquiries into foreign interference.\n\nHowever, there is a strong argument for a focused, independent, and evidence-based examination to assess the response to COVID-19 and provide practical recommendations to prepare Canada for future health crises. The journal stated that there are valuable lessons to be learned from Canada's response, in order to ensure accountability for decisions and actions, and to rebuild confidence in the country's health leadership, which faltered during the pandemic and strained the already struggling public health and healthcare systems.\n\nAnother important reason for an inquiry is to prevent the narrative from being dominated by voices that are not rooted in science or evidence. Without a fact-based inquiry, there is a risk of historical revisionism for personal agendas. It is undeniable that Canada's imperfect response to the pandemic had severe consequences in terms of lives lost and economic impact. Conducting an inquiry would provide a comprehensive roadmap for reform and improvement.\n\nWe need to strengthen our medical supplies and protective equipment stockpiles, streamline mass vaccination plans, refine economic supports, protect long-term care facilities, address social inequities, improve planning and communication, and strengthen leadership and coordination. Previous investigations have consistently highlighted these areas for improvement, along with the importance of surveillance, risk reduction, and stockpiling supplies.\n\nThe long-term care commission in Ontario has already produced a thorough critique and action plan for the province, emphasizing the chronic understaffing, underfunding, structural deficiencies, and inadequate regulations that have plagued these facilities for decades. Justice Archie Campbell's report after the 2003 SARS epidemic stressed the importance of the precautionary principle, which prioritizes taking action even without absolute certainty, as the greatest mistake is not acting at all.\n\nSome issues raised by the British Medical Journal, such as politicians making grand promises but delivering limited results and the challenges faced by a diverse federal nation, are perennial problems. However, it is crucial to keep pandemic preparedness at the forefront of government priorities. Both focus and determination must be maintained, as the scientific evidence shows the high cost of failure and the inevitability of future pandemics. A formal inquiry would guide Canada in improving its response and doing better in the future. END"}

This extended period is causing difficulties in accurately predicting property tax estimates for investors who have suspended or canceled their projects due to the uncertainty. Additionally, the reassessment delay may lead to higher property tax payments for some individuals as municipalities raise tax rates to compensate for outdated property values.\n\nRaymond Williams, chair of tax policy at the Canadian Property Tax Association, a group that co-signed a letter to Premier Doug Ford in July, emphasized that when the assessed value of a property does not reflect current market trends, municipalities have no choice but to increase the tax rate in order to generate additional revenue. Williams, who is also a commercial property tax consultant at Altus Group, highlighted the need for this measure.\n\nThis news comes after a recent investigation by the Toronto Star into Ontario's property assessment system, which revealed that homeowners are paying disproportionately high or low amounts of property tax due to inconsistent assessments by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) compared to the actual sales prices of homes. During a reassessment, MPAC assigns new values to properties based on factors such as location, size, and construction quality, using a valuation date determined by the government. Municipalities rely on these assessed values to calculate property tax payments for homeowners and businesses.\n\nThe government quietly updated the assessment act this week, ensuring that all assessments conducted in 2024 by MPAC will still be based on the valuation date of January 1, 2016. MPAC, a publicly funded non-profit organization responsible for assessing over 5.5 million properties in Ontario, provides an updated assessment roll each year that includes changes such as permitted additions, renovations, new structures, or new construction. Municipalities pay more than $200 million annually for this service, with the City of Toronto alone paying $46.5 million last year.\n\nMembers of the coalition are voicing concerns that MPAC's assessment values have become difficult for property owners to comprehend. The longer the time between the assessment date and the present, the more challenging it becomes for homeowners to determine the accurate current value of their properties. Robert Brazzell, a spokesperson for the Greater Toronto Chapter of NAIOP, an association representing commercial real estate developers, explained this issue.\n\nInternational research supports the link between reassessment delays and inaccurate assessments, as stated in a policy brief from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. The longer it takes for a jurisdiction to reassess property values, the greater the potential for tax inequities to arise. The Toronto Star's investigation confirmed this, even in 2016 when the real estate market was less inflated. The investigation found that, on average, homeowners with more affordable properties were consistently paying more than their fair share of property tax, while those with more expensive properties were paying comparatively less.\n\nMayor-elect Olivia Chow and the NDP opposition have called for a review of MPAC's assessment system in response to the Toronto Star's reporting. Despite this, MPAC asserts that it disagrees with the Star's findings and emphasizes that numerous internal and external assessments have concluded that its methods meet international standards. MPAC considers the Star's reporting to be \"inflammatory and misleading to property owners regarding the accuracy and quality of their assessments.\" END"}

He had secured a job in tiling and renovation at schools and retirement homes across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), with a promised hourly wage of nearly $35. However, after dedicating countless hours to his work without receiving payment, Juravliov knew he had to take action. In the fall of 2022, he filed a claim with the provincial labor ministry to address this issue.\n\nBy December, a case officer had successfully ordered his employer to pay Juravliov a staggering $32,000 in stolen wages. The Star, with the help of Freedom of Information legislation, obtained a breakdown of all successful claims for workplace violations between April 2020 and December 2022, as well as data on the amount of recovered unpaid wages by the labor ministry. The Star shared these findings with Parkdale Community Legal Service and Downtown Legal Services.\n\nAccording to the internal records, from 2020 to 2022, more than 8,400 workers in Ontario filed successful claims for various workplace violations, including failure to receive overtime, minimum wage, severance, termination pay, or other entitled compensations. These workers were owed a combined total of over $36 million. However, as of the end of 2022, the government's efforts to collect this compensation had only recovered just under 40% of the funds, according to The Star's analysis.\n\nA spokesperson from the Ministry of Labour disputed The Star's analysis, stating that the amount of recovered funds is actually much higher. The spokesperson explained that the internal records analyzed by The Star do not provide complete data on instances where companies have paid orders to compensate workers, which is one of the methods employed to collect unpaid wages. Unfortunately, the ministry could not provide this information due to organizational limitations, even though The Star had previously obtained such figures through a freedom-of-information request.\n\nMary Gellatly, a community legal worker with Parkdale Community Legal Services, expressed concern over the government's inability to transparently track and present this crucial data. She emphasized that without clear information, it becomes difficult to have a meaningful public conversation about the enforcement of basic minimum standards in our workplaces.\n\nWhen workers file wage theft claims, the outcomes can vary, and some processes can take longer than others. Employers have the option to pay the workers before the ministry issues a ruling, allowing the workers to resolve and withdraw their claim. Alternatively, the two parties can reach a settlement before any ministry findings, resulting in workers receiving some, but not necessarily all, of their owed money. If the worker chooses to pursue the claim and the ministry rules in their favor, the employer can voluntarily comply and pay the owed wages. However, the majority of employers opt not to do so, as shown by the ministry data obtained by The Star. Between 2020 and 2022, less than 10% of workers' unpaid wages were recovered through voluntary compliance.\n\nWhen employers do not comply, they are issued an order to pay, which must be fulfilled within 30 days. These orders to pay are a crucial aspect of enforcement, but have long been a point of contention for advocates, as previous labor ministry data has indicated their limited success. In 2017, academic research found that only 37% of employers fully honored these orders. Unfortunately, in response to inquiries for this story, the labor ministry explained that it could not provide a breakdown of the successfully collected funds through orders to pay due to how the data is stored. Without this information, it is difficult to understand the extent to which the Ministry of Labour is using its enforcement tools to compel employers to pay unpaid wages, according to Gellatly.\n\nWhen orders to pay fail, the responsibility for collections efforts falls to the finance ministry.

The analysis focused on cases where the Ministry of Labour found that a worker was owed money and how much of that money the province was able to recover. \n\nAccording to internal data released by the ministry, it was discovered that a total of $36 million was owed to workers between 2020 and 2022. Through voluntary compliance, the province was able to recoup about $3 million. When employers didn't comply and cases were sent to collections, the province recovered an additional $9 million, according to data from the Ministry of Finance.\n\nUnfortunately, the Ministry of Finance determined that $23 million was \"uncollectable\" during that same time period. However, despite the challenges, the province was able to recover close to $13 million of the $36 million owed as of December 2022, according to the data. It's important to note that this data does not include any money that may have been recovered after that date.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the way the labour ministry counts the amount it recovers has changed. Furthermore, it now includes settled and withdrawn claims in the amount of money it says it has recovered on behalf of workers. This was not the case prior to 2017. Settlements resulted in workers receiving around $10.8 million between 2020 and 2022, according to the data.\n\nHowever, it's important to understand that settlements and withdrawn claims do not involve ministry officials determining how much workers are legally owed. Therefore, the analysis conducted by the star treated these as separate categories, as determining a recovery rate requires knowing the amount the worker was entitled to in the first place.\n\nPrevious academic research has shown that settlement outcomes tend to be less favorable to claimants compared to when a case officer completes an investigation and issues a decision.\n\nWhen taking into account settled and withdrawn claims, voluntary compliance, inspections, and finance ministry collections, the labour ministry states that a total of $60 million has been recovered for workers over the past three fiscal years. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the math. The breakdown of collections provided by the ministry adds up to only $39.6 million. The ministry has not provided an explanation for the $20.8 million difference, except to say that the data does not include money collected through orders to pay due to the inability to provide that information. The Ministry of Finance claims to have collected $8.6 million through collections in fiscal years 2020\/21 and 2021\/22, which is $1.8 million more than what the ministry says it collected. Unfortunately, neither ministry has commented on this discrepancy.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the labour minister shared that \"everyone in Ontario should be paid for the work they do\" and that the ministry uses \"every available avenue\" to seek the recovery of stolen wages. The spokesperson emphasized that anyone who tries to take advantage of workers is not welcomed to operate in the province. END"}

The assessed value of the property was around $4.6 million, but it sold for millions more. However, obtaining this kind of information for this house and over 20,000 other residential properties in Toronto was a complex process that took nearly two years. In many cities in the United States, property assessment and sale data is readily available to the public. This data has shown that property values often overtax the working class and benefit the wealthy. Unfortunately, in Ontario, this kind of data is heavily guarded. The Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) has a history of protecting assessment data and denying property owners access to it. They argue that releasing this information could harm their economic interests. Despite being funded by taxpayers, MPAC has been compared to \"the Kremlin\" by one Toronto city councillor. MPAC claims that their work is accurate, fair, and easily accessible to the public. However, when we asked the City of Toronto for a copy of its digital assessment roll, we were told that their licensing agreement with MPAC prohibits data sharing. We hoped that MPAC would be willing to show how far they've come since 2006 when their valuations were criticized as \"sophisticated guesswork\" by Ontario's ombudsman. However, MPAC said that the assessment records were not entirely theirs to give. Sales data belongs to the province and is licensed to a company called Teranet, which has exclusive rights to operate Ontario's electronic land registry. MPAC relies on this sales data for property values and would need Teranet's permission to provide the information to us. Despite our best efforts, Teranet denied our request. So, we took matters into our own hands and collected the data ourselves. We focused on collecting data on Toronto houses that sold in 2016, the year of MPAC's last assessment update. According to Ontario's Assessment Act, assessments should reflect a property's \"current value\" as of a specific date set by the government. In Ontario, this date is January 1, 2016. To obtain the sale values, we sifted through property records for tens of thousands of residential properties. Finding the assessment value for each property was more challenging. We used publicly accessible terminals at Toronto City Hall that allowed us to look up assessment records, but only one address at a time. Over the course of a year, we built a dataset of approximately 20,000 residential properties. We then shared this data with Prof. Christopher Berry from the University of Chicago and data scientist Eric Langowski, who have extensive experience studying property assessments in the US. They analyzed our dataset using the same methods they used for assessments in various US cities. END"}

While there are concerns about an earlier-than-expected fall wave and the emergence of new variants that spread quickly, experts believe that this autumn will be different from previous years. The Canadian population is being protected by high levels of immunity, which come from a combination of vaccinations and previous infections. Additionally, a new COVID booster is expected to provide further protection by specifically targeting the most dominant subvariants of this year. Though there are still uncertainties about how the fall will unfold, experts have provided information about the new boosters and advice on when to get updated defense.\n\nEven though we are currently in a calmer phase of the pandemic, experts emphasize the importance of remaining vigilant as the virus continues to evolve. They believe that this new round of vaccines is crucial in reducing the impact of a fall and winter wave. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist and professor, expressed hope that vaccines, at least for the highest-risk individuals, will be available before the real spike in COVID activity occurs.\n\nNational health advisory groups, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI), have recently provided COVID recommendations that suggest leading experts anticipate a significant COVID season. The updated boosters will specifically target the XBB Omicron subvariants, which have been prevalent in 2023. These boosters will be different from previous ones, as they will only contain the spike antigen from the more recent Omicron sublineages, rather than the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and earlier variants.\n\nBoth Pfizer Canada and Moderna Canada have confirmed that they submitted requests to Health Canada in June to update their COVID boosters to monovalent vaccines targeting the XBB 1.5 variant. They are awaiting authorization, and the boosters are intended for individuals six months and older. Although the approval timeline has not been clarified by Health Canada or the vaccine manufacturers, Moderna has stated that they will be ready to supply the updated vaccine in time for the fall vaccination season, pending approval. Experts, including Matthew Miller from McMaster University, agree that these boosters will likely be available around the same time as seasonal flu shots, which is expected to be early to mid-October.\n\nOverall, while we navigate through autumn and prepare for potential challenges, it is reassuring to know that high levels of immunity and new boosters targeting specific subvariants are helping to protect the Canadian population. By remaining vigilant and taking advantage of these updated defenses, we can face the fall and winter with more confidence and resilience. END"}

It affects every aspect of life, from the economy to housing and firefighting, both in the air and on the ground. While there is not much positive news, it is important to compare this situation to the shocking island fire in Lahaina, Hawaii. In Lahaina, residents were not warned by sirens, and they had no safe place to go until they reached the ocean, which did not provide the salvation they had hoped for. Scientists had warned about the danger from invasive grasses that fueled the fire, but unfortunately, little action was taken. Similarly, scientists have been warning about warming oceans as well. This reactive approach is typical of the American way of governance, where we tend to respond rather than plan ahead. So, in that sense, the situation in the Northwest Territories could be worse. At least people were warned, and there are options for evacuees. The long line of vehicles leaving the city can easily access gas, food, and water, essential supplies. For those who are unable to drive for 14 hours to Edmonton and other places, there are flights available. Efforts are being made to create firebreaks, treeless areas that can stop the fire's progress. However, when it comes to the human side of things, there is a lack of long-term accommodations for evacuees. This is a common theme in modern times, with people constantly on the move due to circumstances beyond their control. These massive fires that have engulfed Canada's far north and west are nearly impossible to fight actively. They are simply too vast and spreading too quickly. Canada needs all the resources it can muster to combat this catastrophe, but the fires are omnipresent. Margaret Atwood once wrote that the great historical theme of Canadian life is \"survival,\" and that seems to be the prevailing sentiment at the moment. While Americans may continue their pursuit of boundless freedoms and personal wealth, Canadians have always known how to navigate a challenging landscape, even as we hold on to our southern border. Indigenous peoples thrived in this vast land filled with trees until settlers arrived. The once-terrifying wilderness eventually became a sense of security. On a planet growing increasingly hot, we always had the north, a place to escape to that was cold and familiar. But now it seems we may have exhausted all our options. The reliable cold that we counted on is disappearing as the great forest landscape burns. On Wednesday, the prime minister called for an emergency meeting to address this extreme situation. It is quite absurd that most evacuees will be staying in Alberta, where the premier has recently halted large wind and solar energy projects. It is reminiscent of the sheriff in \"Jaws\" who insisted there was no shark and the beach was safe. Will Canada's forests be unrecognizable next August? Will landslides block more roads, crops suffer from drought, and air quality become unbearable? Will avalanches, fake snow, and floods wash away homes? Unfortunately, the answer is likely yes. Bringing up Danielle Smith and the federal conservatives, earlier we mentioned the silent sirens during the Lahaina fire. Officials have now clarified that these sirens were not intended to warn people of fires but rather tsunamis. However, this miscommunication may have led people to drive into the flames. At that point, there was no good escape route available. END"}

A young woman who worked at a safe-injection site, and a man charged with manslaughter, were known to each other. The woman allegedly helped him escape after a gun battle, which resulted in the death of Karolina Huebner-Makurat, a mother of two. This shocking incident has shattered what little trust remained between the community and the health center.\n\nSources have revealed that the young woman and the man were acquainted, although the exact nature of their relationship is unclear. The woman was working at the facility when the gunfight occurred. She is accused of aiding the man's escape and assisting him on subsequent occasions while evading the police for five weeks. Additionally, she is alleged to have lied to investigators during interviews.\n\nThis incident highlights several social issues that continue to plague Toronto. Our justice system's revolving-door approach to bail, the failure of released individuals to adhere to their conditions, brazen street crime, and the negative consequences of supervised injection sites in residential areas are all contributing factors. While harm reduction is the focus of these sites, it sometimes leads to an escalation of harm. Although defenders of this specific site deny any connection between the facility and Huebner-Makurat's murder, the arrest of an employee raises doubts.\n\nThe community's concerns go beyond knee-jerk opposition to safe injection. They have pleaded for proper management, communal involvement, accountability, and assurances of safety. They worry about their children witnessing open drug use, the presence of dirty needles and other dangerous paraphernalia, overt sex-for-drugs transactions, and the presence of drug traffickers around the facility.\n\nEfforts have been made to address these concerns, such as clearing out a laneway that attracted drug users. The Toronto Police Service has also offered support through their crime prevention environmental design component. However, the responsibility for maintaining a safe 15-meter perimeter around the building lies with the center.\n\nSouth Riverdale was one of the first supervised consumption sites to open in 2017, and now there are at least eight such sites in Toronto. Some have been more problematic and visible than others. In May, a fatal stabbing occurred in front of one of these sites. The Toronto Board of Health has even proposed decriminalizing all illegal drugs for personal use in the city, which could lead to further social complications similar to what has been observed in Vancouver's downtown eastside.\n\nIt is crucial for the center to address these concerns and rebuild the shattered trust within the community. Residents are not opposed to safe injection; they simply want proper management, community involvement, and assurances of safety for themselves and their children. END"}

It feels like summer is flying by! In a meeting on Thursday, City Hall wrapped up the preliminary transition period to her leadership by assigning members of City Council to committees and boards. During her speech at the meeting, Chow reminisced about her time on City Council during the chaotic early days of amalgamation. She shared a story about how she approached Mel Lastman, whom she was expected to oppose, and asked him how they could work together. When he asked her what she was passionate about, she replied \"children\". Lastman then made her the children's advocate, allowing her to start projects to improve the lives of kids in the city. Chow's approach to leadership explains why some of her appointments may seem surprising, as she has chosen to include those who were once seen as rivals. For example, Jennifer McKelvie, who was John Tory's right-hand woman and endorsed Ana Bailão for mayor, retains the title of deputy mayor and continues to chair the infrastructure committee. Another example is Shelley Carroll, who also endorsed Bailão, and will serve as budget chief. Even Brad Bradford, who seemed to be running a campaign against Chow, will be vice-chair of the planning and housing committee. Chow acknowledged his expertise and dedication to the file in her announcement. Additionally, former police officer Jon Burnside will sit on the police board, and veteran Mike Colle will be a ceremonial deputy mayor. Frances Nunziata, who Chow's allies vigorously opposed in the last election, will remain as council speaker. It seems that Chow's strategy is not about keeping enemies closer, but rather giving potential opponents roles that align with their passions. This approach keeps everyone working together towards a common goal. It is a stark contrast to Tory's approach, which kept certain councillors away from influential roles. Speaking of councillors, it's worth taking a closer look at the roles of Gord Perks and Josh Matlow after Thursday's meeting. Some observers on social media commented that Matlow, who ran against Chow for mayor, was being left out by not chairing any committees. However, he is part of Chow's executive team and will sit on the TTC board and the planning committee. These were the three things he specifically requested. Matlow expressed gratitude for his role, and Chow considers him a part of her \"inner team\". While there may be some drama behind the scenes, it seems likely that Matlow will play a significant role in this government. The appointment of Perks to oversee the housing file is interesting because he has been vocal about his skepticism towards the private-sector approach to the housing crisis. He advocates for public housing and rent controls, which aligns with Chow's housing platform. However, it's curious to see him paired with Bradford, who supports private building, as the chair and vice-chair of the file. It sets up an interesting dynamic - will they collaborate effectively, combining their different specialties to make progress? Or will they end up in constant conflict? Only time will tell. END"}

Despite his wrongdoings, the premier has yet to face any consequences for his actions. However, before we pass judgment, let's pause and reflect on the past. In 2018, a video surfaced in which Ford vowed to bulldoze protected lands, but Ontarians gave him a free pass during that year's election. They took him at his word when he swiftly renounced his secret plan, promising to leave the greenbelt undisturbed. Since then, Ford has remained in power without facing any major challenges.\n\nBut now, after winning his second election in 2022, Ford has once again changed his stance. Will voters forgive him for his contradictory statements and forget his betrayal, as they did in 2018 and 2022? Times are changing, and it seems that time is running out for the premier. While political victories are often unpredictable, defeat can be foreseeable for opposition parties that fail to prepare adequately. Unfortunately, the New Democrats have yet to gain traction under their new leader, Marit Stiles, who assumed her position uncontested and remains relatively unknown.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for the Liberals, as a highly contested leadership race is currently underway, gaining momentum and culminating next December. If this is the prime time for the greenbelt scandal, it is also the perfect time for the Liberals to seize the moment and capitalize on it. The opposition is already taking advantage, as an auditor general's report this month condemned the corrupted process surrounding the greenbelt issue, estimating a potential $8.28 billion benefit for \"favoured\" private developers. This has certainly riled up voters, who were largely indifferent during the last election. Nate Erskine-Smith, a Toronto MP and one of the Liberal leadership candidates, believes that the Liberals failed to provide a viable alternative to Ford back then, but the situation has changed with their revival and the betrayal by Ford's Tories.\n\nSoon, we will see whether voters recognize the difference as the Liberal race intensifies. The first of five official debates will begin next month, with all five candidates participating in the first public debate hosted by the Democracy Forum at Toronto Metropolitan University on September 20th. When it comes to the greenbelt issue, Ford's problem lies not only in his latest proposal but also in his past promise. He will not only bear the weight of benefiting favored developers through the greenbelt bonanza but will also have to explain to voters how they can trust him after explicitly promising not to take any actions that he ultimately took.\n\nLet's revisit the secret recording and public records. In early 2018, while running for the Progressive Conservative leadership, Ford privately expressed his desire to \"open a big chunk\" of the greenbelt to create a larger supply. However, when word got out, Ford gave his word that he would not touch the greenbelt. He claimed to listen to the people and respect their wishes, stating that he governed through them, not through the government. At that time, Ford had just won the Progressive Conservative leadership, while then-Premier Kathleen Wynne cautioned Ontarians not to entrust Ford with such an important responsibility. She emphasized the irreversibility of losing greenbelt land and the significance of preserving water systems and agricultural land.\n\nWynne pointed out that there was already enough available land in the region to build two more cities the size of Mississauga without compromising the greenbelt. Years later, an advisory panel established by the PC government reached the same conclusion but was disregarded. END"}
{"prompt":"bo bichette is back with the blue jays and not a second too soon for a team that lost its firm grip on a wild-card spot while he was away . bichette hasn’t been officially activated from the 10-day injured list , but he rejoined his teammates prior to friday night’s series opener against the reds and is expected to play saturday . barring any setbacks , it would mark his first appearance since leaving with a right knee injury on july 31 . when bichette got hurt , the jays had a 3 1\/2-game lead over the seattle mariners for the final wild card . after the jays lost 1-0 to the cincinnati reds on the eve of his potential return , the mariners pulled even pending the outcome of their game against the houston astros . the jays went 8-8 without bichette , whose absence overlapped with injuries to closer jordan romano , reliever trevor richards , centre-fielder kevin kiermaier and third baseman matt chapman . romano returned earlier this week , while richards and kiermaier were activated friday . outfielder nathan lukes and reliever jay jackson were optioned to buffalo to make room . the hope is that the return of the 25-year-old bichette will help the jays do more than that . he has been the jays’ best player this season , and a lineup that has been starved for offensive production much of the year desperately requires his potent bat . even though bichette has yet to play this month , he entered friday as the american league leader in hits with 144 . he ranked second with a . 321 average and first on the jays in on-base plus slugging percentage at . 846 , while trailing vladimir guerrero jr . ( 18 ) for the lead in home runs by just one . chapman has been worth more wins above replacement . but if the vote were held today , few could argue against bichette being the team’s most valuable player . during a down season for guerrero , bichette has become the heart and soul of the lineup and one of its only consistent producers . his imminent return also gives the jays one of the biggest upgrades possible on the diamond . he’ll bring consistent production to a spot in the order that has become a black hole in recent weeks . even if bichette takes time to settle in , his presence alone will provide more value than what the jays were getting . during bichette’s absence , fill-in shortstop paul dejong was a lost cause at the plate . he was acquired at the deadline from the st . louis cardinals to provide solid defence and the seven-year veteran delivered that , but his offensive contributions were non-existent . since entering the starting lineup on aug . 2 , dejong had three hits ( all singles ) while striking out an astonishing 18 times without a walk in 44 plate appearances . he has been as close to an automatic out as it gets . bichette certainly isn’t that , and the jays need the boost he figures to provide . the jays entered friday ranked 17th in the majors with 63 runs this month . on the season , they’re 16th with 4 . 48 runs per game , well below expectations . don’t expect bichette to be eased back in . he’s here to play and , outside of an occasional game or two at designated hitter , there won’t be too many times when dejong finds himself back at shortstop . “bo , if he’s back , he’s going to be expecting to play a full game , ” schneider said wednesday . “that’s our expectation , too . within that , whenever he does come back , there will probably be a day when he dh’s or something like that . ” bichette appeared in two rehab games for triple-a buffalo . on wednesday , he went 2-for-3 as the dh and tested his knee by scoring from first on a double by ernie clement . on thursday , bichette went 2-for-2 with a home run and three rbis while playing six innings at shortstop . the jays need that production at the big-league level , and they’ll be hoping to get similar contributions from kiermaier and chapman . kiermaier hadn’t played since aug . 6 because of a laceration on his right elbow , while chapman had been out since aug . 12 with a finger injury . ->","completion":" Great news for Blue Jays fans! Bo Bichette is finally back with the team, and just in time. While he hasn't been officially activated from the injured list yet, he rejoined his teammates before Friday night's game against the Reds and is expected to play on Saturday. This will be his first appearance since leaving with a knee injury on July 31.\n\nWhen Bichette got hurt, the Jays had a comfortable 3 1\/2-game lead over the Seattle Mariners for the final wild card spot. However, in his absence, the team struggled, going 8-8 and losing their grip on the wildcard position. The Mariners caught up with them after the Jays lost 1-0 to the Cincinnati Reds on the eve of Bichette's potential return.\n\nBichette's return is not the only good news for the team. Closer Jordan Romano has already returned earlier this week, and reliever Trevor Richards and center-fielder Kevin Kiermaier were activated on Friday. Outfielder Nathan Lukes and reliever Jay Jackson were optioned to Buffalo to make room for them. Third baseman Matt Chapman is also making progress in his recovery.\n\nBichette has been the Jays' standout player this season, with impressive stats. Even though he hasn't played this month, he currently leads the American League in hits with 144 and has a batting average of .321, ranking second in the league. He also leads the team in on-base plus slugging percentage at .846, just one home run shy of Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Bichette may even be considered the team's most valuable player if a vote were held today.\n\nHis return will provide a much-needed boost to the lineup, which has struggled to produce offensively. Bichette's consistent production at the plate will be a significant upgrade, especially in the shortstop position, which has been lacking in offensive contributions recently. In contrast, the fill-in shortstop Paul DeJong has struggled offensively since joining the team, with only three singles in 44 plate appearances. Bichette's presence alone will bring more value to the team than what they were previously getting.\n\nThe Jays' offensive numbers have been below expectations this season, ranking 16th in the league with 4.48 runs per game. Bichette's return should help improve these numbers, providing a much-needed spark to the lineup.\n\nThe team is fully expecting Bichette to play a full game upon his return, with the occasional game as the designated hitter. There won't be many instances where DeJong finds himself back at shortstop. Bichette has already shown promise in his rehab games for Triple-A Buffalo, with solid hits and even a home run.\n\nOverall, the return of Bo Bichette is fantastic news for the Blue Jays and their fans. With him back in the lineup, along with the return of Kiermaier and Chapman, the team is hoping for a boost in offensive production and a resurgence in their fight for a wild card spot. END"}
{"prompt":"the most ambitious bid to rescue the global oil industry ever seen has been swept aside by a brutal wave of demand destruction . less than two weeks ago , the world’s biggest oil producers — in a deal facilitated by u . s . president donald trump — agreed to slash output in the hope of defending energy markets against the ravages of the coronavirus outbreak . yet monday’s historic slump , in which crude prices fell below zero in the u . s . , made the opec cartel and its partners painfully aware of the limits of their powers . some nations in the group are desperately searching for any additional steps they might take to stem the rout , but they have few options . “the opec+ leadership is currently engaged in serious crisis management conversations , ” said helima croft , head of commodity strategy at rbc capital markets llc . yet “there is little that opec+ can do to arrest the demand collapse . ” early start algeria , which holds the organization of petroleum exporting countries’ rotating presidency , has proposed bringing forward the supply cuts — due to begin on may 1 — to take effect immediately , according to three people familiar with the matter . but there was no sign that the move was backed by opec’s key members , or would even make much difference at this point . though the production cutbacks pledged by opec+ are historically large , at just under 10 million barrels a day or about 10 per cent of world supply , they’re completely dwarfed by the immensity of the demand loss . consumption will be down by 29 million barrels a day this month , according to the international energy agency — more than all the crude pumped by opec’s 13 members . the severity of the price collapse is prompting some opec ministers to get on a conference call on tuesday for informal discussions about the market . saudi arabia’s cabinet said it is ready for more measures to ensure market stability in cooperation with other opec+ nations , echoing a joint riyadh-moscow statement last week . but it’s unclear whether the kingdom really has the appetite , or the ability , to cut production deeper . the latest production agreement requires considerable sacrifice from the saudis , squeezing output to the lowest since 2011 and potentially offering its u . s . shale rivals the lifeline of a price bump . for others in the accord , such as russia and iraq , it’s highly uncertain whether they’ll even deliver the ambitious supply curbs already agreed on , let alone commit to further reductions . both exporters had a poor track record in implementing opec+ agreements over the past three years . the kremlin on tuesday was dismissive about the implications of the price collapse on russia’s economy , with spokesman dmitry peskov telling reporters “there’s no need to give this an apocalyptic tinge . ” rather than step up its efforts , opec and its partners may simply need to stick to the agreed plan and weather the storm . that will push the burden of adjustment onto other producers , such as the u . s . , brazil and canada , which have so far offered opec+ little more than moral support . “we’ve reached the stage where this is pretty much outside the control of anybody , ” martijn rats , oil analyst at morgan stanley , said in a bloomberg television interview . “there is no group of suppliers that can offset this through production cuts . ” ->","completion":" The global oil industry is facing unprecedented challenges due to a significant decrease in demand. Just a couple of weeks ago, the world's largest oil producers, with the help of President Donald Trump, agreed to reduce output in an effort to protect energy markets from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. However, Monday's historic drop in crude prices, which even went below zero in the US, has highlighted the limitations of their efforts. Some countries within the oil-producing group are desperately exploring additional measures to stabilize the situation, but their options are limited.\n\nAlgeria, the current president of OPEC, has proposed advancing the planned supply cuts to take immediate effect, but it remains uncertain if this proposal will be supported or have a significant impact at this point. While the production cuts agreed upon by OPEC+ are substantial, reducing around 10 million barrels per day or roughly 10% of global supply, they pale in comparison to the immense decrease in demand. The International Energy Agency predicts a decline of 29 million barrels per day this month, which exceeds the combined production of all OPEC members.\n\nThe severity of the price collapse has prompted OPEC ministers to hold informal discussions on the market, and Saudi Arabia's cabinet has expressed its willingness to take further measures in collaboration with other OPEC+ nations. However, it remains unclear if Saudi Arabia has the desire or ability to implement deeper production cuts. The current production agreement already demands significant sacrifices from the Saudis, reducing output to its lowest level since 2011 and potentially benefiting their US shale rivals with higher prices. The commitment of other nations, such as Russia and Iraq, to deliver on the agreed supply curbs is also uncertain, considering their poor track record in implementing previous OPEC+ agreements.\n\nAmidst the price collapse, Russia's government seems unfazed about the impact on their economy, stating that there is no need for a doomsday perspective. Instead of intensifying their efforts, OPEC and its partners may need to stick to the agreed plan and weather the storm. This will shift the burden of adjustment onto other producers, such as the US, Brazil, and Canada, who have so far only offered moral support to OPEC+. According to oil analyst Martijn Rats, it has reached a point where no group of suppliers can compensate for the decrease in demand through production cuts.\n\nIn conclusion, the global oil industry is facing significant challenges due to a sharp decline in demand. While OPEC+ has made efforts to stabilize the market, the magnitude of the demand loss outweighs their production cuts. Some nations within the group are exploring additional measures, but their options are limited. Other producers will need to play a role in adjusting to the current situation. Despite the difficulties, it is important for OPEC and its partners to stay committed to their agreed plan and navigate through this challenging period. END"}

While there have been claims that Nada owns luxury cars like a Maserati Quattroporte and Lamborghini Aventador, license plate records show that he actually drives a Lincoln Navigator SUV. Nada has faced allegations of fraud and unjust enrichment from buyers who are now suing him. However, he vehemently denies these accusations, stating that some buyers are trying to extort more money from him through the media.\n\nNada explains that his project, Modern Manors, a planned condo and townhouse development in Richmond Hill, faced numerous challenges that ultimately led to its cancellation. These challenges included permit delays, soaring building costs, and provincial tax legislation affecting foreign buyers. As a result, 72 purchase agreements were canceled, including one with Pires. Nada clarifies that Modern Manors was just one of nine multi-dwelling projects that Ideal, his company, began since 2015. While two projects were transferred or sold to other developers, three others have yet to be built. Nada expects construction on two of these developments to start this year.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Nada remains committed to rectifying the situation. He reveals that he used his own money to repay deposits, and even sold his mansion in 2020 to help pay off debts. Ideal's website described the mansion as the \"ultimate of perfection,\" and it was purchased by Nada's business associate. However, a lawsuit alleged that this sale was an attempt by Nada to protect his assets from creditors. Nada did not respond to the lawsuit, but a judge ordered him to pay the plaintiff $150,000. Nada insists that the allegations of shielding assets are baseless and purely fabricated, and he has been actively working to resolve the case with the plaintiff.\n\nBob Aaron, a real estate lawyer and columnist, believes that even one canceled project is too many. He suggests that the government should implement measures to prevent developers from canceling projects due to financing issues. Instead, developers should have a limited timeframe, such as a year or two, to secure financing. After that, they should be obligated to purchase the units at fair market value.\n\nNada's journey to success began when he arrived in Canada as a 19-year-old refugee from Sri Lanka.

Councilor James Pasternak believes that implementing a sales tax across the entire region, with the support of other municipalities in the GTA, could be a viable solution that wouldn't negatively impact local retailers. He also suggests exploring a foreign buyer land transfer tax that encourages investment without discouraging it. However, he is against implementing a parking levy due to concerns about the fragility of the retail and commercial sector after the pandemic.\n\nCouncilor Alejandra Bravo acknowledges the strained relationship between senior levels of government and the municipal level, with costly services like transit operations being downloaded onto the city. She believes it is essential to consider all potential tax options, although it is too early to predict which ones the council might approve.\n\nCouncilor Stephen Holyday agrees with the report's recommendations to seek a fairer arrangement on costs falling within provincial and federal jurisdiction.

Our neighboring country is going through an unprecedented test of their democracy, and unfortunately, this situation could potentially worsen in the months to come. Even worse, these issues are becoming normalized because the public has become desensitized to the constant exposure of Trump's outrageous behavior, which has dominated the news cycle for years.\n\nTo provide some context, Trump is currently facing a total of 78 charges, including 44 federal charges and 34 state charges. He has been criminally charged in New York, Florida, and the District of Columbia, with pending charges in Georgia. Additionally, he has faced civil trials, one of which resulted in a conviction for sexual abuse, which the judge defined as \"rape.\" The most serious allegations against Trump pertain to his efforts to deny and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. These specific charges include conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the congressional confirmation of Joe Biden's victory), and obstruction of that confirmation. Most notably, he incited a crowd to storm Congress on January 6, 2021, a truly dark day in U.S. history.\n\nThese charges regarding Trump's post-election actions represent a pivotal moment in U.S. history, as they directly challenge a fundamental function of government: peacefully collecting, counting, and certifying election results. Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law expert at Harvard University, stated that \"the crimes indicted are an order of magnitude beyond anything that has been committed against this country by any American citizen, let alone a former president,\" emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nHowever, despite facing these charges, Trump still maintains a significant lead of 37 points over his closest competitor in the race for the Republican nomination for the next presidential election. He is also running neck-and-neck with the incumbent Democrat, Joe Biden. Alarmingly, almost seven in 10 Republicans still believe that Biden's victory was illegitimate, and some supporters of Trump perceive the prosecution against him as a Democratic plot to destroy his presidential ambitions for 2024.\n\nIf Trump were to win the presidency again, he could potentially pardon himself if he has been convicted, although it remains uncertain if he has the legal authority to do so. Alternatively, he could direct his justice department to dismiss any outstanding charges. Should another Republican win the White House, Trump would likely be able to persuade them to pardon him, as many of his competitors have shown a concerning loyalty to him, believing that the Biden administration has \"weaponized\" the justice department to prevent Trump's return to power.\n\nAs Canadians, we must not view these events as mere spectator sport. American trends, even the undesirable ones, have a history of crossing the border into our own country. We have already witnessed an extended occupation of our capital, and there have been instances where our political leaders have been subjected to vile names and baseless accusations during public appearances. Additionally, our democracy is also threatened by foreign interference. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has been consistently attacking since assuming leadership, but the responsibility to shift our political dialogue from venomous to healthy debate lies with all of our leaders.\n\nOur neighbors are on a dangerous path, but we have the power to choose a different course. It will require enlightened political leadership to ensure that we do not fall into the same pitfalls. END"}

These resolutions are our way of trying to improve ourselves and make a positive impact on the world in small ways. We write them down and discuss how we can support each other in achieving them. This year, the IPC (Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario) has also made a New Year's resolution. Our goal is to enhance our privacy and access outreach to children and youth, with the aim of empowering the next generation of digital citizens in Ontario. To fulfill this resolution, we are excited to announce the creation of a new Youth Advisory Council for 2023. This group of highly engaged young people will provide valuable guidance to our office in developing educational materials that are relevant and meaningful to their generation. We are thrilled to introduce the members of our Youth Advisory Council, who come from diverse backgrounds and communities across the province. They range in age from 15 to 24 and have a wide range of interests and experiences, including science, technology, business, law, social justice, and more. Outside of school, they also actively contribute to their communities and participate in various activities. Among our council members, we have a talented violinist from the Hamilton Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and the founder of a Model United Nations club. Others are involved with Indigenous friendship centers, their high school's Black Student Union Association, or serve as mentors for 2SLGBTQ+ students. What truly impressed me when reading their applications was the common desire to collaborate with others and make the world a better place, including a commitment to fostering tomorrow's digital citizens. Children and youth in a digital world is one of the key priorities of the IPC. We are dedicated to championing digital literacy and digital rights for young people, while also holding public institutions accountable for protecting the children and youth they serve. We have already taken significant steps by working with youth advocacy groups, creating resources like the Privacy Pursuit! Game and activities for children, and launching a youth-focused Instagram page. Our Info Matters podcast has focused on privacy and access issues among children and youth, and we recently held a Privacy Day event centered around this theme. However, we realized that something crucial was missing from all these initiatives: the voices of young people themselves. Today's youth have grown up in the digital age, and nobody understands their needs, desires, fears, and challenges better than they do. Their fresh perspectives are invaluable in our efforts to promote digital literacy and expand privacy and access rights for youth in a way that truly matters to them. With the input from our new Youth Advisory Council, we are confident that we can make a real difference in the lives of Ontario's children and youth. By equipping them with the necessary tools and resources, they will be better equipped to protect their privacy, safety, and dignity online as they grow and mature. Our ultimate goal is to guide this next generation through the opportunities and risks of the online world successfully. By involving young people in the conversation and learning from them, we can achieve our New Year's resolution of creating a better digital world for our children and future generations to come.

One such investigation is PHIPA Decision 175, which looked into the sale of de-identified data by a health information custodian to a third-party corporation. We first learned about this situation from an article in the Toronto Star, and we launched an investigation under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA). \n\nThere are three important things we learned from this investigation. First, we discovered that de-identification (the process of removing personal information from a record or data set) is considered a use under PHIPA. This means that it falls under the definition of \"viewing, handling, or otherwise dealing\" with personal health information. It's important to note that the use of personal health information for de-identification purposes is allowed without the individual's consent, as long as certain conditions are met. Health information custodians, who are responsible for personal health information, must also be transparent about their information practices by providing a written public notice.\n\nThe second key finding is that if custodians plan to de-identify and sell the data to a third party for various purposes, including health-related research, they must clearly state this in their public notice. Patients have a right to know how their health data will be used and why, so custodians can be held accountable under PHIPA. \n\nThe third important takeaway revolves around a custodian's security obligations. PHIPA requires custodians to take reasonable steps to protect and securely store the personal health information they hold, including during the de-identification process. Any sale agreement between a custodian and a third party must include privacy and security controls to ensure that the de-identified data remains truly de-identified. It is crucial that de-identification is of the highest standard to prevent re-identification and safeguard individuals' privacy. A robust de-identification governance process should also include regular assessments of re-identification risks.\n\nI strongly encourage custodians and public institutions to consult our de-identification guidelines for structured data. These guidelines have received awards and provide an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of de-identification, as well as key considerations when de-identifying personal information. \n\nInterestingly, there are similarities between the main findings of PHIPA Decision 175 and the recommendations made by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics (ETHI) in their recent report on the federal government's collection and use of de-identified mobility data during the pandemic. The ETHI committee emphasizes transparency and ongoing communication with Canadians, explicitly outlining the nature and purpose of data collection programs. Similarly, in PHIPA Decision 175, we highlighted the need for custodians to be transparent by clearly stating the purposes of de-identifying personal health information and its intended use in their written public statements.\n\nThe ETHI report also recommends prohibiting the re-identification of de-identified data and introducing penalties for doing so. It's worth noting that PHIPA has already addressed this issue since 2019, by not allowing the re-identification of de-identified information (with certain exceptions) and making it an explicit offense for anyone to intentionally re-identify data in violation of PHIPA.\n\nLastly, the ETHI report proposes several recommendations for reforming federal privacy laws to address the risks associated with the collection, use, and disclosure of de-identified data. Here in Ontario, the government amended PHIPA in 2020 to allow for the eventual development of regulations that would more explicitly define the expectations and standards for de-identifying data.

Most online platforms still primarily offer credit card payment options, which can be problematic for these individuals.\n\nFortunately, Payment Source has stepped in to offer innovative payment solutions that prioritize financial inclusion, ensuring that Canadians can pay using their preferred method. Payment Source believes there is a better way to pay for everyday things in our lives, driven by a desire to make a positive social impact. \"There's something that motivates and drives us beyond just business,\" says CEO Rob Hyde.\n\nBased in Toronto, Payment Source is part of a flourishing community of over 750 fintech companies in Ontario, making it the largest cluster in North America, second only to New York. Hyde credits Toronto's financial expertise and tech talent for the company's success, as it provides the perfect environment for incubating ideas. In fact, Toronto is North America's fastest-growing tech market and was recently recognized for its impressive \"brain gain\" in the 2022 CBRE Tech Talent Report.\n\nPayment Source has been a lifeline for underbanked Canadians, offering a way for the eight percent of the population without credit cards to make online purchases due to privacy, debt, or personal reasons. However, these cards aren't exclusively for the unbanked. They are also useful for individuals looking to manage their spending and avoid debt. It provides a solution where they can give cards to their children without worrying about exceeding their credit limit.\n\nAs one of Ontario's 148 delegates at this year's Collision Conference, Payment Source plays a vital role in Toronto's thriving tech scene. The collaborative and supportive environment in the city has propelled the company to develop its innovative fintech solutions. Hyde emphasizes that it's not just competition that breeds innovation, but also cooperation.

We are committed to driving digital transformation in order to enhance the well-being of individuals. Ontario's innovation ecosystem provides the perfect environment for our biotech giant, Roche, to establish its AI Centre of Excellence.\n\nRoche is a global leader in biotechnology, operating in 100 countries. When our colleagues in Roche Canada saw the opportunity to create a Centre of Excellence for artificial intelligence, they knew that Canada was the ideal location. They explored the idea from our pharmaceutical headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario. Why Canada? Because our country is home to a small group of exceptional scientists who are at the forefront of AI research. Furthermore, Ontario boasts a thriving AI ecosystem that fosters innovation.\n\nBefore the potential of AI was fully understood, Professor Geoffrey Hinton, an emeritus professor at the University of Toronto, was already pioneering the field here in Ontario. His breakthroughs in AI attracted the attention of top scientific minds from around the world. As his research progressed from the lab to practical applications, an innovation ecosystem developed in the region, including corporate R&D centers and venture capital firms. Today, Ontario is recognized globally as a leader in AI.\n\nRoche's virtual AI Centre of Excellence is leveraging this exceptional AI expertise. We are collaborating closely with the Vector Institute in Toronto, as well as the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII) and the Quebec AI Institute (MILA) as part of CIFAR's pan-Canadian AI strategy. Together, we are driving digital transformation in healthcare.\n\nFanny Sie was chosen to lead Roche's AI initiative due to her background in research and innovation, as well as her belief in the power of collaboration. She is excited about the potential of AI to improve and save lives, and she is motivated to see rapid results. AI enables quick decision-making, especially when faced with vast amounts of information in various formats. Computers can collect, sort, and analyze this data, providing valuable insights in a fraction of the time it would take humans.\n\nDuring the global COVID-19 pandemic, Roche Canada formed the Data Science Coalition, a collaboration of public and private organizations dedicated to finding actionable solutions for patients, healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and governments worldwide. The coalition has been utilizing AI to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact around the world. The AI translates this data into immediate insights for governments, health agencies, and scientists. To date, the coalition has contributed to over 100 digital solutions and insights related to COVID-19.\n\nThe first major undertaking of Roche's AI Centre of Excellence is the End ALS Challenge, an open data competition that connects the global AI and neuroscience communities. The goal is to enhance healthcare professionals' understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and improve diagnosis and drug discovery. This project is the largest and most comprehensive ALS research endeavor in history, generating an unprecedented amount of clinical and biological data that is openly shared with the global research community. The insights gained from the End ALS Challenge could have implications for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of healthcare in Ontario is at the forefront of digital transformation, aimed at improving people's lives. It is a truly exciting time to be part of this innovative and collaborative environment. END"}

I had been working at the embassy almost 10 years ago during the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster, and like then, I could sense that our lives were about to be turned upside down, at least for a while.\n\nIn 2011, we quickly shifted our focus to crisis response and helping Canadians in Japan who were in need. Just like back then, we had to cancel our previously planned initiatives and adapt our business plans to the new realities on the ground. As Ontario's representative in Japan and the head of Ontario's trade and investment office located in the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, I now lead a small team that promotes trade, investment, and science and technology connections between Ontario and Japan.\n\nJapan has always seen Ontario as a great place to invest and a reliable source of imports. However, achieving success here is not always easy, mainly due to cultural and language differences. Building relationships through face-to-face contact is crucial, even though it involves long travel times and a time-consuming consensus-building process before deals are made. Initially, I thought that the absence of business travel and the loss of face-to-face contact due to covid-related restrictions would severely impact our work.\n\nWhile the pandemic has indeed made our work more challenging in many ways, it has also accelerated some positive trends and changes that were already gaining momentum before the global crisis. From my perspective, the most significant change, and the one that presents the most opportunity for Ontario, is Japan's shift in approach to innovation.\n\nJapan is renowned for its innovation, whether it is in how we enjoy music, document memories through photos and videos, navigate our cars, or even use advanced toilet technology. When I was here 10 years ago, Japan's mega-companies mainly relied on in-house teams to innovate and create new ideas and technologies for their branded products sold worldwide. They also had fixed supply chains consisting of trusted domestic partners, making it difficult for outsiders to enter the market.\n\nHowever, the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence and interconnectedness have forced even the most conservative Japanese companies to adopt a more open and collaborative approach to stay competitive. This means that Japanese firms are now more willing to work with innovative foreign companies, both large and small, and invest overseas to tap into innovation-driven ecosystems.\n\nWhile places like California and Israel have initially received attention, there is a growing awareness of what Ontario brings to the table. Ontario boasts an innovation ecosystem that rivals our most famous competitors but with lower costs and other advantages, such as easy access to skilled and diverse talent and an excellent quality of life.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by COVID-19, or perhaps because of it, we have noticed a higher demand from the Japanese business community to connect with Ontario's startup and innovation ecosystems than ever before.

This has made North Bay an even more attractive destination. Mayor Al McDonald explains, \"People are able to work remotely in a place that is not only affordable and offers ample space, but also provides all the amenities of a larger city, such as public transit, recreational facilities, a performing arts center, and even a ski hill.\"\n\nWith this in mind, we have revamped our economic development initiatives. We have intensified our business retention and expansion program and recently launched a package of incentives through our growth community improvement plan. These programs, along with others, will help us continue building on recent successes, such as the establishment of Norgalv Limited, a new galvanizing plant in our airport industrial business park. After exploring various business opportunities worldwide, Norgalv chose North Bay as the location for their new $21-million facility and now proudly calls our city home.\n\nAndre van Soelen, the Managing Director of Norgalv Limited, explains, \"As a group of investors from South Africa, we considered business opportunities across the globe, including Europe and Australia. However, we ultimately chose North Bay. The decision was made easy due to the hard work, dedication, and support we received from all levels of government. It is truly incredible that Canada and North Bay welcomed us with open arms.\"\n\nOur efforts to attract new residents and businesses will align with the federal government's upcoming rural and northern immigration pilot. In partnership with the province, we will also continue to support local businesses and sectors in their recovery from the COVID-19 shutdown. In 2019, North Bay experienced its second-highest construction year on record and celebrated a record-breaking year for film and television activity. We are determined to maintain this positive momentum.\n\nMayor McDonald shares our aspirations, stating, \"We look forward to achieving similar milestones once again.

While the word \"fashion\" may bring to mind clothing and accessories, Andrea Romero, the manager of the Fashion Zone, explains that it encompasses so much more. Fashion is present in everything we touch, from furniture to cellphones. \n\nNestled in the heart of downtown Toronto, the Fashion Zone has been inspiring design innovation since 2013. It serves as an incubator for member companies spanning the fashion spectrum, as well as the product, service, and technology sectors. As part of Ryerson University's experiential learning approach, members have access to mentorship opportunities from over 40 industry professionals and a network of 160 companies within the Fashion Zone's supportive community.\n\n\"We have a community of like-minded entrepreneurs who support each other,\" says Romero. Members receive instruction in the skills necessary to launch a successful company and have 24\/7 access to a well-equipped workspace for prototyping. Additionally, they can tap into the university's student talent pool through the Fashion Zone's associate and apprentice program.\n\nBeyond the realm of the runway, the Fashion Zone provides tailored programming for its unique group of entrepreneurs. This includes workshops on branding\/storytelling, growth marketing, retail operations, and sustainable design. Romero emphasizes the importance of a compelling brand story, as it instills customer confidence in the company's legitimacy. Nonetheless, even the most innovative brands can face challenges if their strategies don't yield growth. This reality is especially true in the fashion industry, which has faster funding cycles compared to technology or software companies. That's why Romero believes the Fashion Zone's greatest value to students lies in helping them identify the most commercially viable piece in their collection by considering production costs and processes. \"We think beyond the runway show,\" says Romero. \"While a show may generate buzz, it doesn't always translate into sales.\"\n\nWith a remarkable 31 percent increase in applications over the past year, Ontario fashion start-ups recognize the value that the Fashion Zone holds for their future success. When selecting members, the Fashion Zone looks for individuals who are coachable, driven, and passionate about their work. Many of these applicants go on to become successful alumni, including companies such as inkbox, knixwear, soxy, 2020 armor, and encircled. By maintaining relationships with its alumni, the Fashion Zone expands its network, creating a collaborative environment for past, present, and future attendees. \"If we can't answer a member's question, we connect them with an alumnus who can,\" says Romero. This mutually beneficial relationship allows start-ups to leverage the incubator's resources and the university's talent pool.\n\nFueled by technology, the Fashion Zone graduated 18 companies last year, with current accelerator participants experiencing a remarkable 69 percent increase in revenue. Positioning itself for further growth, the Fashion Zone has relocated to a new building on Ryerson's campus, which it shares with the Design and Fabrication Zone and the Trans-media Zone. The proximity to the Design and Fabrication Zone is advantageous as the accelerator focuses on interior design, architecture, and the manufacturing process. The Trans-media Zone, specializing in radio, television, and broadcasting, complements the Fashion Zone perfectly as influencers and virtual reality technology become increasingly relevant in the fashion industry.\n\nThe Fashion Zone also has its sights set on forging new global partnerships. \"Ryerson University has connections all around the world, and we are always eager to collaborate with our next partner,\" says Romero. Internationalization is a priority for the Fashion Zone, as it aims to keep more fashion companies in Canada and enhance their ability to scale up within Ontario. While traditional fashion markets may be larger abroad, Ontario-based companies exploring the realms of jewelry, cell phones, tattoos, and more find a solid foundation in Canada that enables their success.

Skilled and high-quality tech workers are flocking to the city, making it a magnet for talent from all over the world. One occupation that has seen remarkable growth is software developers and programmers, with a staggering 58.3% increase from 2017 to 2022. This surge in talent highlights Toronto's appeal as a thriving tech hub.\n\nIt's worth noting that Toronto's tech talent pool experienced a slight decrease in 2022, with 285,700 tech workers compared to 289,700 in the previous year. This can be attributed to the economic uncertainty faced during that time, along with tech layoffs and flexible work arrangements that allow professionals to work remotely from anywhere. Despite this dip in employment, Toronto continues to hold its position as the third-largest tech talent workforce in North America. With Canada's friendly immigration programs, Toronto's tech workforce will remain strong.\n\nOne notable characteristic of Toronto's tech talent is its diversity and young population. Between 2016 and 2021, the city experienced significant population growth in the 20s and 30s age groups. The number of individuals in their 20s grew by 11.1%, while those in their 30s grew by 14.7%. This growth is among the highest across large tech markets, serving as evidence of the city's expanding tech workforce and innovative potential.\n\nWhen it comes to diversity, Toronto's tech talent workforce represents 68% visible minorities, with Asians being the majority. The percentage of women in tech has also been steadily increasing, currently amounting to 27% of the workforce. This commitment to diversity is essential for fostering innovation and creating a vibrant tech ecosystem.\n\nToronto experienced the second-largest tech talent growth in North America between 2017 and 2022, coming in just behind the San Francisco Bay Area. During this period, the city added an impressive 63,800 tech jobs, marking a growth of 29% over the past five years. In fact, Toronto was recognized as the fastest-growing tech talent market in the previous year's edition, showcasing the city's promise in the industry.\n\nTo sustain this growth, Toronto is actively expanding its tech talent pipeline, ranking in the top 10 among its U.S. counterparts for tech degree completions. Between 2017 and 2021, tech degree completions grew by 41.7%, surpassing the national average growth. This commitment to nurturing talent is crucial for the continued success of Toronto's tech industry.\n\nToronto's tech talent is primarily concentrated in the tech industry itself, closely followed by the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) industry. Approximately 43% of tech talent in Toronto works within the tech industry, while 20% is employed within the FIRE industry. This concentrated workforce has fostered a robust innovation ecosystem, supporting Toronto's rise as a global hub for artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, the significant presence of tech workers in the FIRE industry complements Toronto's reputation as a leader in financial services innovation and a top destination for fintech investments. With all five of Canada's largest banks headquartered in Toronto, along with notable fintech companies like Wealthsimple and Borrowell, the city has solidified its position as the largest financial center in Canada and the second-largest in North America.\n\nToronto is undeniably a thriving tech job market, offering an ideal environment for tech professionals. The city's strong growth in tech talent, combined with leading tech companies and a wide range of job opportunities, has established it as the top job market. In fact, Toronto created 31,405 more tech jobs than there were graduates. Recognizing the potential of the city, tech leaders such as Snowflake and Oxbotica have invested in Toronto's tech ecosystem by establishing a presence here. The government of Canada has also launched a 'tech talent strategy,' introducing additional immigration programs to attract global tech talent and support Canada's status as a leader in this field. Among these programs is a streamlined work permit for H1-B visa holders in the U.S., which was met with great success, reaching its target of 10,000 applicants within just two days. This is a testament to how attractive Toronto is for jobseekers in the tech industry. END"}

It is home to renowned studios like Pinewood Studios in Toronto, which has brought iconic creations to life such as \"The Little Mermaid\" (2023), \"Stephen King's IT\" (2017-2019), and \"Star Trek Discovery\" (2017-2019). Additionally, studios in the city of Markham have produced notable works like \"The Boys\" (2022) and \"Women Talking\" (2022). Markham is even constructing the largest studio in Canada, funded in part by Ryan Reynolds, featuring 20 sound stages. Furthermore, the city of Mississauga has plans for a 450,000 square foot studio that will create around 5,000 long-term jobs in the film industry. These studios, powered by the innovative technologies developed by the region's over 289,000 skilled tech professionals, contribute to the continuous growth of the creative tech industry.\n\nThe animation and visual effects industry in the Toronto region alone has experienced a remarkable 42 percent growth in the past five years. In the 2020-2021 academic year, more than 1,200 students enrolled in game and interactive media programs, while 1,400 students enrolled in animation-related programs at postsecondary institutions. With exciting technological advancements happening every day and some of the most generous tax incentives in the world, it's no wonder that the bustling media industry in the Toronto region seizes these opportunities to innovate and captivate audiences worldwide.\n\nThe \"Ontario's Next Gen Industry\" report revealed four key findings. Firstly, there is a growing demand for senior and mid-level talent in the creative tech field, with immigration serving as a solution. As the tech industry expands rapidly, the creative tech field is still relatively new, resulting in a larger pool of entry-level talent compared to senior-level professionals. To address this, facilitating immigration pathways will enable creative tech studios to attract senior-level talent from all corners of the globe. \n\nSecondly, focusing on equity, diversity, and inclusion is crucial for talent attraction, with a particular emphasis on inclusivity. The demographic trends indicate that 40 percent of Canadians will belong to a racialized group in the future. At present, 50 percent of the Toronto region's population identifies as a visible minority. Despite having a diverse talent pool and a relatively diverse tech sector, there is still work to be done in promoting inclusivity in creative tech fields. This involves narrowing the gender gap, combating systemic biases, and increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in leadership positions.\n\nThirdly, while local postsecondary institutions offer high-quality programs, further adaptation is necessary to meet the evolving needs of the market. Technology is constantly advancing, and Ontario's postsecondary institutions are leading the way by providing a diverse array of studies in creative tech. However, educational programs must align more closely with real-world trends in digital media. Implementing micro-credentials, as Ontario Tech University has done, is an excellent approach to achieving this.\n\nLastly, Ontario's creative tech sector is a harmonious blend of small studios and large multinational companies. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the creative tech industry in Ontario has proven to be resilient. To sustain steady growth, it is essential to attract large multinational studios while supporting the growth of startups through government incentives. Attracting large-scale companies also has a positive \"spillover effect\" by facilitating the attraction of senior-level talent for small studios, which is currently in demand.\n\nOverall, the surge of creative technology in the Toronto region has led to a flourishing industry that combines the region's tech expertise with its vibrant creative talents. With an abundance of opportunities, a diverse talent pool, and a supportive environment, the creative tech sector in Ontario is poised for continued success, innovation, and inspiration on a global scale.

{"prompt":"manufacturing matters the long-awaited manufacturing renaissance ? “is this the moment ? . . . is this the tipping point ? ” these are the immediate questions i asked myself when i read the announcement that volkswagen was going to build a battery cell plant in st . thomas , ontario . put another way , the top oem in the world is building a leading-edge manufacturing facility along ontario’s existing automotive corridor , which will help spur a structural industry transformation . i couldn’t have been more thrilled at the news ! we haven’t had an oem of this size enter canada in over 35 years . so , the idea of adding a second electric battery plant almost one year after stellantis and lg energy solutions made their landmark announcement in windsor put a shockingly large smile on my face ! the decline of the manufacturing sector in ontario is well known and documented . offshoring really started to become a trend in the late 1990s and the financial crisis of 2007\/08 seemed to have accelerated it even more . many of my family members have made and continue to make a living from manufacturing , in particular the auto sector , so i have an understanding how this downward slide has impacted not just families but whole communities as well . for years now i’ve been reading about the possibility of a “manufacturing renaissance” in canada , but i haven’t really been able to envision how it would take hold… let alone begin . this idea really picked up steam during the pandemic , with reshoring being a possible solution to all the calamitous supply chain disruptions we were experiencing . don’t get me wrong , i’ve always been a proponent of a domestic manufacturing sector , but i still didn’t fully buy into the idea of a large-scale reindustrialization taking place given how cost-centric global supply chains tend to be . i had many thoughts after the volkswagen announcement , which made me start to believe that this is indeed the beginning of something much bigger . but two ideas in particular have been the locus of my thinking since i read the news the industrial commons is a collection of resources that a manufacturer in a given industry can draw upon to maintain or improve its competitiveness as well as drive innovation . this collection consists of , but is not necessarily limited to , the skills and knowledge of the labour force , supplier networks , customers , trade schools , colleges and universities and even competitors . having the world’s largest oem enter ontario’s existing automotive ecosystem , by adding what will be a second gigafactory , is an unprecedented addition to the industrial commons . no doubt the majority of the impact will be noticeable in the automotive sector , but skills and knowledge gained here will transfer to some degree into other manufacturing sectors as well . it can be easily argued that the automotive industry is undergoing its largest transformation since factory electrification . the irony here is palpable . but , i believe we have a real differentiator in ontario when compared to what i see happening in the u . s . auto sector . all of ontario’s oems are effectively contained within a 550-kilometer corridor of major highways . but , when you look at a map of the assembly plants in the u . s . , it is a virtual scattershot all over the eastern half of the country . proximity is important for two reasons . first and most obvious , the closer your shipping and final delivery points are to each other usually translates to lower transportation costs . but it’s the second reason that i find much more interesting . there’s still a great deal of innovation taking place and with that , having suppliers in closer proximity to their customers allows for more effective ( and more frequent ) in-person collaboration between the two . this can be crucial when there’s a need to be first-to-market and when dealing with a great deal of manufacturing precision required for final assembly . a manufacturing renaissance is something that has been discussed for decades . it’s always seemed that no matter how many great ideas have been developed , there has never been enough real traction in order to make these ideas come to fruition . but , given what i’ve seen over the last year , combined with volkswagen’s recent gigafactory announcement , i can’t help but feel optimistic that now is the moment where our regional manufacturing sector really starts to take off . i can’t wait to find out if i’m right ! ->","completion":" I was extremely excited when I heard the news that Volkswagen is planning to build a battery cell plant in St. Thomas, Ontario. This is a significant milestone, as it marks the entrance of a major global car manufacturer into Canada after more than 35 years. It's even more thrilling considering that just a year ago, Stellantis and LG Energy Solutions made a groundbreaking announcement about establishing an electric battery plant in Windsor. The decline of the manufacturing sector in Ontario has been well-documented, and many families and communities, including my own, have been affected by it. However, there has been talk about a potential manufacturing renaissance in Canada, and although I was skeptical, recent events have made me believe that this could be the beginning of something significant.\n\nThe industrial commons, which encompasses the skills and knowledge of the labor force, supplier networks, universities, and even competitors, plays a crucial role in maintaining competitiveness and driving innovation for manufacturers. With the world's largest car manufacturer entering Ontario's automotive ecosystem and building a second gigafactory, the impact on the automotive sector will undoubtedly be substantial. Moreover, the skills and knowledge gained here will likely benefit other manufacturing sectors as well. The automotive industry is currently going through a major transformation, and it's interesting to note that Ontario has a unique advantage compared to the scattered assembly plants in the eastern half of the United States. Ontario's manufacturers are conveniently located within a 550-kilometer corridor of major highways, allowing for lower transportation costs and more effective collaboration between suppliers and customers. This proximity is particularly valuable when it comes to being first-to-market and meeting the precision requirements of final assembly.\n\nA manufacturing renaissance has been a topic of discussion for years, but it has always lacked the necessary momentum to become a reality. However, with recent developments and Volkswagen's gigafactory announcement, I am feeling optimistic that now is the time for our regional manufacturing sector to truly flourish. I can't wait to see if my optimism is justified! END"}

{"prompt":"municipal world ontario municipalities and their citizens are marking an important anniversary with the arrival of this new year . it has been exactly 10 years since they embarked upon what was heralded as a “new era” in municipal accountability – an era that is still evolving . on january 1 , 2008 , the transparency and accountability of local governments was enhanced considerably . although the municipal act , 2001 required local councils and board meetings to be open to the public ( with certain limited exceptions ) , the only way to challenge a closed meeting prior to 2008 was through the courts , a costly option open to few . that year , changes to the law enabled members of the public to complain about closed meetings of municipal councils , local boards , or committees – and have their complaints investigated . for many in the municipal sphere , 2008 was also when a new word entered their vocabulary “ombudsman . ” under the act , the ontario ombudsman was the default investigator for complaints about closed meetings . if a municipality did not appoint its own investigator for such complaints , the ontario ombudsman would conduct the investigation , free of charge . if the investigation deemed the meeting illegal – that is , if it didn’t fit within the narrow circumstances outlined in the act , under which closed meetings were permissible – there would be a public report and recommendations . ten years later , municipal accountability has continued to grow . on january 1 , 2016 , the office’s mandate was expanded to include not just closed meetings , but oversight of all aspects of municipal government and services . [1] as of new year’s day 2018 , new amendments to the act further refined the open meeting rules , adding four new exceptions and a much-needed definition of “meeting . ” and . . . in 2019 , every municipality will also be required to have a code of conduct and provide public access to an integrity commissioner . the introduction of the closed meeting investigator regime in ontario was not always smooth sailing . the ombudsman’s office was unfamiliar to many at the local level , despite four decades of experience in resolving complaints about the provincial government . not only that , enforcing the open meeting rules – narrowly defined by law – took some getting used to for an office like ours , whose key role has always been informal resolution . while the open meeting regime is quite different from the office ' s regular oversight activities , it nonetheless adds value though validation of processes or constructive feedback on how municipalities and local boards can improve governance through enhanced transparency . despite the challenges and learning curve for all stakeholders that came with the 2008 amendments , many benefits have surfaced . and the feared flood of complaints did not materialize . as the investigator for almost 200 of ontario’s 444 municipalities , the ombudsman ' s office receives roughly 100 complaints per year ( related to a still smaller number of meetings ) . the only year that bucked this trend was 2013 , when high-profile closed meetings in just two cities – london and sudbury – accounted for more than 100 complaints from concerned citizens . those cases demonstrated the strong public interest in open meetings , which was later amplified in local elections . but overall , the complaint rate remained steady . a little-known fact about the received complaints is that many were from council members themselves . they often turned to the office in confidence , driven by concerns or confusion about whether they and their colleagues were following the open meeting rules . this turned out to be an excellent educational opportunity as clerks , caos , provincial officials and , of course , ombudsman staff developed and spread the word about best practices for transparent and publicly accountable meeting procedures . and , it ultimately paved the way for improved accountability mechanisms at the local level , including codes of conduct and integrity commissioners , and even local ombudsman services , all of which are increasingly being embraced by municipalities now . slowly but surely , municipalities have also begun to record their closed meetings – a recommended best practice . this is a remarkable change , given that , back in 2008 , it was not uncommon to discover councils where the mistaken belief was that even taking minutes in closed meetings was against the law . ( in fact , the reverse is true , and recordings contribute to an accurate record and efficient investigations . ) today , the most common concerns heard from municipalities are not that different from those of 10 years ago . fears persist that a sudden flood of complaints to the ombudsman or to local accountability mechanisms will tax their limited resources . this , too , is an important educational opportunity . ->","completion":" Ontario's municipalities and their citizens have reached an exciting milestone with the start of the new year. It has been a decade since they embarked on a journey towards greater municipal accountability, and this progress is still ongoing. On January 1, 2008, significant changes were made to enhance the transparency and accountability of local governments. Prior to this, challenging a closed meeting could only be done through the courts, which was a costly option for very few people. However, in 2008, new laws allowed members of the public to complain about closed meetings, which would then be investigated.\n\nThis was also the year when the word \"ombudsman\" entered the vocabulary of many in the municipal sphere. Under the new laws, the Ontario ombudsman became the default investigator for complaints about closed meetings. If a municipality didn't appoint its own investigator, the Ontario ombudsman would conduct the investigation free of charge. If the meeting was found to be illegal, a public report and recommendations would be made.\n\nOver the past ten years, municipal accountability has continued to grow. In 2016, the ombudsman's office expanded its mandate to include oversight of all aspects of municipal government and services, not just closed meetings. The act was further refined in 2018 with new amendments to the open meeting rules, including new exceptions and a clear definition of what constitutes a meeting. In 2019, every municipality will also be required to have a code of conduct and provide public access to an integrity commissioner.\n\nThe introduction of the closed meeting investigator regime in Ontario faced some challenges. Many at the local level were unfamiliar with the ombudsman's office, despite its four decades of experience in resolving complaints about the provincial government. Additionally, enforcing the open meeting rules, which were narrowly defined by law, took some adjustment for an office that had always focused on informal resolutions. However, despite these challenges, many benefits have emerged.\n\nContrary to fears, there was not a flood of complaints. As the investigator for almost 200 of Ontario's municipalities, the ombudsman's office receives roughly 100 complaints per year related to a smaller number of meetings. It is worth noting that many of these complaints were from council members themselves, seeking guidance on following the open meeting rules. This presented an excellent educational opportunity to spread best practices for transparent and accountable meeting procedures.\n\nFurthermore, the complaint rate remained steady, apart from a notable increase in 2013 due to high-profile closed meetings in two cities. This demonstrated the strong public interest in open meetings, which was later amplified in local elections. Many municipalities have embraced improved accountability mechanisms, such as codes of conduct, integrity commissioners, and even local ombudsman services.\n\nIn addition, municipalities have made progress in recording their closed meetings, which is now seen as a recommended best practice. It is remarkable how far we have come, considering that in 2008 it was not uncommon for councils to believe that even taking minutes in closed meetings was against the law. Today, the most common concerns from municipalities are similar to those from ten years ago. There is still a fear that an influx of complaints will overwhelm limited resources. However, this is seen as an important opportunity for education and improvement.\n\nOverall, Ontario municipalities and their citizens have made great strides in enhancing municipal accountability. The journey has had its challenges, but the progress made over the past ten years is undeniable. With continued dedication and education, we can further strengthen transparency and ensure that local governments are accountable to their citizens. END"}

The role of an ombudsman is to ensure accountability, transparency, and fairness in the public sector. They achieve this by listening to citizens' complaints about a branch of government or a public sector body, determining the validity of the complaint, and collaborating with stakeholders to find a solution. As an independent and unbiased officer, it is crucial for the ombudsman to earn the trust and credibility of all parties involved. The ombudsman's office is not biased towards the complainant or the public sector bodies it oversees. Demonstrating impartiality and fairness is vital for building productive relationships that can lead to positive change. This sometimes involves recognizing the achievements of public sector bodies, as well as shedding light on instances of mismanagement or unfairness. The interactions and relationships formed by the ombudsman's office in resolving individual complaints have a significant impact on their ability to address systemic issues and suggest changes in policies and procedures. If ombudsman offices only focus on individual complaints, they miss the opportunity to address the root causes and suggest measures to prevent them from happening again. This is why systemic investigations are crucial as they provide the ombudsman with a chance to make a significant positive impact on society. The ombudsman is uniquely positioned to propose solutions to problems that affect large segments of society. To add maximum value, it is crucial for the ombudsman's recommendations to be accepted and implemented. The Office of the Ombudsman of Ontario has successfully used various techniques to achieve this, which we will discuss later in this paper. However, the process of getting recommendations accepted starts with relationship building. This involves establishing credibility and trust with all stakeholders, including the public sector bodies under the ombudsman's oversight. Trust and credibility are earned by employing a fair and credible process. If the ombudsman aims to promote procedural fairness, they must lead by example and be fair in the investigative process. This includes notifying the organization in advance of the systemic investigation, ideally through a meeting with the organization's head. During this meeting, the ombudsman should explain the reasons for the investigation, ensure a fair and impartial process, emphasize a collaborative approach, and invite input and commentary from the organization at any time. Whenever possible, it is beneficial to demonstrate the value of the ombudsman's systemic investigation to the organization. It not only serves the public interest but can also be in the organization's best interest. The organization's work may be validated by an independent third party, boosting internal morale, or constructive feedback may be provided to address the root causes of complaints and prevent their recurrence. I often emphasize to the leadership of public sector bodies that they should not fear or discourage complaints. Instead, progressive organizations should see complaints as opportunities to improve relationships with stakeholders and enhance operations. As Bill Gates once said, \"a dissatisfied customer is your best source of feedback.\" If people perceive an organization as unfair or unconcerned about treating them properly, they will be less likely to engage and accept its decisions. This can lead to appeals, litigation, and non-compliance issues, which require time, energy, and money to resolve. On the other hand, if stakeholders feel heard and fairly treated, they are more likely to accept the organization's actions and decisions. By being responsive to complaints and implementing the ombudsman's recommendations to address systemic issues, a public sector body can demonstrate a commitment to fairness and effective administration. This, in turn, builds trust and confidence in the organization among the public. Often, an ombudsman's systemic investigation addresses an issue that middle management is aware of and wants to fix but lacks the necessary resources. Once the ombudsman's report becomes public, it is not uncommon for resources to become available, and the leadership to appreciate the ombudsman's intervention. This results in a \"win-win-win\" outcome. END"}

ombudsman. This is great news for residents in BC, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon, as their ombudsmen have already been able to handle municipal complaints for a while. However, in Ontario, this marks the beginning of a new era of accountability at the local level.\n\nThe passing of \"Bill 8\" - the Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act, 2014 - allows for independent oversight of the broader public sector for the first time. In case you're not familiar, an \"ombudsman\" is a citizen's representative who investigates complaints from the public about the government's mishandling of certain matters. In Ontario, the ombudsman is one of seven independent officers of the legislature who oversee different aspects of the provincial government.\n\nLast year alone, the ombudsman's office received over 23,000 complaints and assisted citizens with a wide range of issues, including incorrect tuition fees, medical care in correctional facilities, and confusing hydro bills. However, complaints about the \"mush\" sector - municipalities, universities, school boards, hospitals, long-term care facilities, police, and children's aid societies - have been outside the ombudsman's jurisdiction since the first ombudsman was appointed in 1975.\n\nSince 2005, the ombudsman's office has had to turn away more than 24,000 \"mush\" complaints, with municipalities being the most complained-about area. Complaints about municipalities have covered various topics, such as garbage collection, snow removal, conflict of interest, and the conduct of council members. Many citizens have felt that they had no other option for an independent review of their local concerns. But now, as of January 1st, that will change.\n\nWith this in mind, let's address some of the most common questions that the public and municipal officials have been asking about what ombudsman oversight will mean for them.\n\nThe ombudsman's office accepts complaints through email, fax, web form, telephone, and in person. The best part is that all services are completely free of charge, as the office is funded through the provincial treasury. Rest assured, complaints made to the office are strictly confidential, and all investigations are conducted privately. Complainants will never be identified without their consent.\n\nThe ombudsman's staff will treat municipal complaints just like provincial complaints, carefully assessing each one to determine if they can provide assistance. If the issue can be resolved at the local level, they will refer the complainant back to the existing accountability mechanisms. However, if the problem cannot be solved locally, they may step in to ask the municipality for more information. When necessary, the ombudsman's team will conduct independent investigations into individual and systemic issues and provide recommendations to help improve government administration, service, and accountability.\n\nMany Ontarians are probably familiar with the ombudsman's large-scale systemic investigations, which have led to published reports and recommendations for significant changes. Since 2005, almost all of these recommendations have been accepted and implemented by the provincial government. For example, in 2006, the provincially-run Municipal Property Assessment Corporation underwent a complete overhaul following the ombudsman's recommendations after a systemic investigation into nearly 4,000 complaints. Similarly, in 2015, Hydro One agreed to address its billing and customer service problems after the ombudsman's systemic investigation into almost 11,000 complaints.\n\nHowever, the majority of cases brought to the ombudsman's team are resolved quickly, informally, and typically within two weeks.

We received a total of 25,161 cases, including complaints and inquiries, between April 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022. This represents a 25% increase compared to the previous fiscal year. Many of these cases were related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such as vaccine mandates in universities and colleges, as well as delays in provincial programs we oversee. However, a significant number of cases involved complex administrative issues, which have always been our specialty. For instance, we helped families access developmental services or social benefits.\n\nAs always, we resolved the majority of these cases without the need for a formal investigation, with 52% of them being resolved within two weeks. Our top priority has always been to help vulnerable individuals navigate difficult or unfair systems. For example, we addressed the concerns of individuals with disabilities who were unable to renew their health cards online due to not having driver's licenses. Thanks to our intervention, the system has been changed. We also assisted inmates in accessing healthcare services and facilitated the process for Ukrainian individuals fleeing the war in their country to obtain Ontario driver's licenses quickly.\n\nWe are proud to have published two investigative reports this spring. One report focused on the cuts to French-language programs at Laurentian University, while the other looked into the sudden closure of youth justice programs in Northern Ontario. All of our recommendations in both cases were accepted. We have also made significant progress in two complex systemic investigations: one regarding delays at the landlord and tenant board and the other regarding the government's monitoring of long-term care homes during the pandemic. We eagerly anticipate their completion in the coming months.\n\nIn the municipal sector, we received an unprecedented number of complaints as municipalities grappled with the legal and technical aspects of holding virtual and hybrid meetings while adhering to the open meeting requirements of the Municipal Act, 2001. We provided valuable guidance to municipalities through numerous reports and letters, contributing to our open meeting digest online, which serves as a rich database of decisions.\n\nIt is worth noting that questions about the role of the ombudsman are not new. However, we are pleased to report that there has been significant progress in international recognition of the ombudsman's essential role in democracy. The Venice Principles, a set of 25 global standards to ensure stable, independent, and effective ombudsman institutions worldwide, were proclaimed in 2019 and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2020. These declarations, outlined in detail in the next section of this report, establish global standards and protections for the ombudsman institution. They enhance our ability to promote fair administration, human rights, good governance, and the rule of law. We are actively working with our international colleagues to inform our governments, citizens, and stakeholders about these principles, as well as implementing them through self-assessment and peer review.\n\nIn May 2022, we had the pleasure of joining our fellow members of the International Ombudsman Institute's board of directors for our annual in-person meeting in New York. This meeting allowed us to have productive sessions with several missions and permanent representatives to the United Nations, where we promoted the resolution and the Venice Principles and strengthened our ties with the UN. This progress is an encouraging sign for a world that is eager to overcome the challenges of the past two years.\n\nThroughout this time, we have consistently demonstrated the importance of independent oversight in protecting citizens' rights.

Stern School of Business, Invest NYC SDG is a multi-year project designed to build a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban economy in New York City. We use the UN SDGs as a framework to catalyze projects that address major challenges like reducing carbon emissions, promoting sustainable urban mobility, and tackling food insecurity.\n\nAlthough Invest NYC SDG is housed at an academic institution, it is not just a research project. While research forms the foundation, our main aim is to leverage NYU's influence and convening power to encourage collaboration between the public, private, philanthropic, social, and academic sectors. By doing so, we can accelerate the development of new sustainable businesses and organizations in NYC.\n\nNew York City has already set a solid foundation by aligning its sustainability goals with the UN SDGs. Invest NYC SDG builds upon this foundation and paves the way for further progress. We are identifying private-sector business and finance opportunities with key players, realistic incentives, government support, community partnerships, and significant impact on the SDGs. Through concrete projects in NYC, we are also identifying government policies and finance innovations necessary for success.\n\nOur work not only benefits NYC but also serves as a roadmap and toolkit for other cities, both in the US and internationally, to effectively tackle the SDGs with strong private-sector support. We believe that effective collaboration between the private and public sectors at regional and local government levels is crucial for systemic change.\n\nThe opportunities for business and sustainable development are immense. A report by the UN Business and Sustainable Development Commission suggests that there is a $12 trillion business opportunity through multi-stakeholder interaction. This highlights the potential for the private sector to contribute significantly to the SDGs.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that public infrastructure plays a vital role in supporting the focus areas of this project. Public entities own and operate much of this infrastructure, requiring ongoing management and maintenance in changing environments. Governmental action faces constraints, including regulations that hinder partnering with the private sector for innovative projects and policies. Nonetheless, systemic policy and operational change are possible.\n\nThe NYU Center for Sustainable Business provides a platform for multi-stakeholder engagement. As a trusted research university, NYU brings together a diverse academic community with various departments engaged in SDG issues.

They are now sharing space with another crop called pulses. This broader range of crops is transforming the prairies into more of a \"bean pot\" rather than just a breadbasket. Although wheat is still a significant crop, especially in western Canada, pulses are growing in both size and importance. They now cover millions of acres of cropland in Canada and contribute significantly to the country's agricultural revenues.\n\nRory McAlpine, an expert in the agribusiness industry, spoke about the positive economic benefits that come from this diversity in pulse crops. Pulses, which include beans, peas, and lentils, are essential crops for the plant protein industry, which is rapidly expanding. Canada proudly holds the title of the world's largest exporter of pulses. Pulses are leading the way towards a future with healthy, delicious, and sustainably produced food.\n\nAt the Future Food-Tech Alternative Proteins Summit in New York City, Mr. McAlpine and Invest in Canada CEO Laurel Broten discussed how Canada's advantages in alternative protein production make it an attractive location for global agri-food investors. Ms. Broten asked Mr. McAlpine to explain how Canada has achieved 39% of the global market share in pulses. Mr. McAlpine mentioned sustainability as one of the reasons, pointing out the climate resilience of pulses. He also highlighted how pulse crops contribute to carbon sequestration, helping address climate change. Pulse Canada has conducted research that calculates the carbon-negative impact of key pulse crops in Canada, equating it to removing millions of cars from the road. This data is based on real production information from farms across the country.\n\nWhile harvesting the right crops is crucial for industry prosperity and environmental sustainability, Mr. McAlpine emphasized the importance of people in the equation. The workforce, built upon a history of agrifood, science, and innovation, is a critical ingredient for the future success of the industry. Canada has a dual advantage in terms of its labor force. With strong population growth and a high-quality education system, the country is well-equipped to meet the varied needs of the industry. Mr. McAlpine mentioned that labor shortages are a global challenge, but Canada's population growth and excellent education system ensure a strong talent pool. He also stressed that it's not just about high-skilled workers; semi-skilled and low-skilled workers are equally important for a value chain approach.\n\nIn addition to having the best tertiary education system in the world according to the OECD, Canada is experiencing the highest population growth among G7 countries. Mr. McAlpine noted that within a year, Canada welcomes one million new citizens, highlighting the extraordinary rate of immigration. The country's attractiveness to the global talent pool is undeniable. END"}

Over the next few years, Dr. Blouin will dedicate some of his time to consulting with staff and faculty, addressing their queries, and assisting the university in developing policies and guidelines for the use of AI and machine learning systems. Dr. Blouin emphasizes that AI is not just a technological concern; it's a matter of ethics and people. We need to decide when it's appropriate to delegate automation and decision-making to algorithms and software systems, particularly within a knowledge-sharing institution like a university. Everyone should feel empowered to participate in this important conversation.\n \nDr. Blouin has already taken initiative by hosting meetings and giving presentations to numerous faculties and faculty councils. His immediate focus is to create a guidance document for fall courses, outlining how AI tools, such as large language models, should be approached. Dr. Blouin acknowledges the need for clear boundaries to ensure faculty members can make informed decisions regarding their curriculum. The guidance document will serve as a starting point for discussions and encourage engagement with the subject.\n\nLooking ahead, Dr. Blouin's objective is to equip Dal with the necessary processes and personnel to navigate an AI-driven digital future. The rapid pace of change demands proactive preparedness, enabling the university to evaluate opportunities and overcome challenges as they arise. It is crucial that we make nuanced decisions, collaborating across disciplines to ensure our success in this endeavor.\n\nIt's essential to understand that AI does not aim to replicate human thinking as depicted in science fiction movies like Terminator or The Matrix. Instead, AI involves computer processes that swiftly analyze vast amounts of data, whether text or numerical, to accomplish specific tasks. These tasks, typically associated with human capabilities, include generating complex text or producing lifelike images. AI tools allow computer software to perform these functions at an unprecedented level of quality.\n\nAlthough the capabilities of AI can be daunting, they also offer immense benefits. These systems operate quickly and at a massive scale, streamlining time-consuming tasks that do not require creativity or analysis. For example, a large language tool can summarize a 90-page proposal and provide bullet points within seconds, a task that would take hours for a human to complete. This allows users to efficiently review a vast amount of information. However, it's important to note that critical decisions should never be solely based on AI-generated work.\n\nIn conclusion, Dal is committed to harnessing the potential of AI while ensuring that ethical considerations and human judgment remain at the forefront. By engaging in open dialogue and fostering a collaborative environment, we can navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by AI, ultimately shaping a successful future for the university and its community.

{"prompt":"how a controversial us drug policy could be harming cancer patients worldwide in august 2021 , amol akhade , an oncologist at nair medical hospital in mumbai , india , received an e-mail from the swiss drug manufacturer roche recommending the use of a drug named atezolizumab to treat a specific kind of breast cancer . akhade was surprised . that month , roche had withdrawn the drug for this purpose in the united states ( although it is still approved to treat other kinds of cancer ) . for the type of breast cancer in question — known as triple-negative because it lacks three key protein markers — atezolizumab was made available in 2019 through the us food and drug administration’s ( fda’s ) accelerated approval program . accelerated approval is a fast-track process designed to place desperately needed drugs in the hands of patients quicker than is possible with conventional drug approval . but a follow-up study found that atezolizumab made little difference to tumour growth , and that people who received it were less likely to survive up to two years after treatment than were those not taking it1 . when the fda received these data in 2021 , it indicated that accelerated approval was no longer appropriate , and roche withdrew the drug for this form of breast cancer . the same thing happened with the european medicines agency ( ema ) , based in amsterdam , but not everywhere else . in india , for example , where the drug was still approved for triple-negative breast cancer , roche continued to promote the treatment until at least september , a fact that akhade says he found “quite shocking” . “it’s not like patients with triple-negative breast cancer are different in the united states and outside , ” he says . “we cannot have such differential treatment . ” when asked about its responsibility to patients , genentech , the roche subsidiary in san francisco , california , that developed atezolizumab , said that the drug is still approved in 100 countries for triple-negative breast cancer . “all of our medicines strictly adhere to the regulatory and promotional requirements of all local healthcare authorities , ” said an e-mail from the company . accelerated approvals in the united states are granted on the basis of clinical studies that suggest a health benefit without necessarily demonstrating it fully . the process prioritizes speed over certainty , and it requires companies to complete follow-up studies to confirm a treatment’s benefits . this is a “very reasonable compromise” , says bioethicist holly fernandez lynch at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia , “so long as we can get the confirmatory evidence quickly and reliably” . but there are complications that have made the programme controversial . companies don’t always conduct studies in a timely manner , and the fda hasn’t always been great about enforcing them . researchers have noted that the median time to withdrawal for a drug that fails to hold up in confirmatory studies is four years2 sometimes it takes decades . and some high-profile accelerated approvals have raised eyebrows . experts worry that the evidence used to support the approval of the alzheimer’s disease drug aducanumab was insufficient three fda advisers resigned in protest . other specialists have complained that the process allows companies to market expensive drugs for rare childhood diseases to desperate parents without sufficient evidence . there are currently nearly 200 cancer treatments approved through this pathway . follow-up studies have led to the withdrawal of 26 , and 68 are still awaiting confirmatory evidence ( see ‘cancer drugs on the go’ ) . a lot of prescriptions can be made in the time between a drug’s accelerated approval and the publication of follow-up results . if those results are negative , the drug can still be prescribed to many people before its eventual withdrawal , and even afterwards — particularly when professional medical bodies recommend its use . and accelerated approvals have an effect beyond us borders , thanks to the fact that many countries use fda decisions to guide their own regulatory policies . at the heart of the problem , says lynch , is a failure of communication — both in the outcomes of follow-up studies and the nature of accelerated approval itself . “clinicians and patients often view fda approval as an on–off switch — either a drug is approved or it’s not , ” she says . but it’s not that simple . ->","completion":" In August 2021, Dr. Amol Akhade, an oncologist at Nair Medical Hospital in Mumbai, India, received an unexpected email from the Swiss drug manufacturer Roche. The email recommended using a drug called atezolizumab to treat a specific type of breast cancer. Dr. Akhade was surprised because just the month before, Roche had withdrawn the drug for this purpose in the United States. However, it is still approved for other types of cancer.\n\nFor this particular type of breast cancer, known as triple-negative because it lacks three key protein markers, atezolizumab was approved in 2019 through the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated approval program. This program is designed to make necessary drugs available to patients as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, a follow-up study found that atezolizumab did not significantly slow tumor growth and actually decreased survival rates compared to those not taking it.\n\nWhen the FDA received this data in 2021, they determined that accelerated approval was no longer appropriate for this form of breast cancer and Roche withdrew the drug. The same decision was made by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based in Amsterdam. However, in India, where the drug was still approved for triple-negative breast cancer, Roche continued to promote its use until at least September. Dr. Akhade found this discrepancy \"quite shocking\" as patients with triple-negative breast cancer are the same everywhere and should receive equal treatment.\n\nWhen asked about their responsibility to patients, Genentech, the Roche subsidiary in San Francisco that developed atezolizumab, stated that the drug is still approved in 100 countries for triple-negative breast cancer. They assured that all their medicines adhere to the regulations and requirements set by local healthcare authorities.\n\nAccelerated approvals in the United States are granted based on clinical studies that suggest a health benefit, even without fully demonstrating it. While this prioritizes speed, companies must complete follow-up studies to confirm the treatment's benefits. However, complications have made the program controversial. Companies don't always conduct these studies promptly, and the FDA has not consistently enforced them. Withdrawal of a drug that fails to hold up in confirmatory studies can take years or even decades.\n\nSome high-profile accelerated approvals have raised concerns. The approval of the Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab, for example, was challenged due to insufficient evidence, leading three FDA advisers to resign in protest. The process has also allowed companies to market expensive drugs for rare childhood diseases to desperate parents without sufficient evidence.\n\nCurrently, there are nearly 200 cancer treatments approved through the accelerated approval pathway. While some drugs have been withdrawn after follow-up studies, many are still awaiting confirmatory evidence. This means that a lot of prescriptions can be issued between a drug's accelerated approval and the publication of follow-up results. Even if the results are negative, the drug may still be prescribed, especially when recommended by professional medical bodies.\n\nAccelerated approvals have a global impact because many countries use FDA decisions to guide their own regulatory policies. The main problem, according to experts, is a failure of communication. Both the outcomes of follow-up studies and the nature of accelerated approval itself are not adequately understood by clinicians and patients. FDA approval is not simply an \"on-off switch,\" but rather a complex process. END"}

Despite its allure, this species remains a scientific enigma in many ways. In a lab at Dalhousie University, a group of about 40 people gathered to witness a necropsy on a young great white shark that had washed up on a beach near Parrsboro, Nova Scotia, at the end of June. This incredible discovery provided the students in the seaside summer shark course with a remarkably rare opportunity to see up close one of the ocean's most endangered and mythical creatures, while aiding in the search for clues about its untimely demise.\n\nEmma Martin, a fourth-year marine biology student who was drawn to Dalhousie from Ontario because of the university's biology and conservation of sharks, skates, and rays class, expressed her excitement, saying, \"It is so fascinating to be able to see it and be in this room with all of these amazing experts doing their thing. I've never seen a great white in person before, and it's so cool to learn about the causes of their deaths and what we can do to help. This is one of the main reasons I chose to study at Dal.\"\n\nThe shark, estimated to be about seven years old, was a 2.76-meter male and was retrieved by the Marine Animal Response Society (MARS), a charitable conservation group dedicated to protecting marine species through education, research, and responding to reports of deceased or distressed marine animals. Tonya Wimmer, MARS's executive director and a graduate of Dalhousie's marine biology program, received a call on June 24 about the shark. With the assistance of scientists from the University of Windsor, they were able to legally obtain the endangered species under their Species at Risk Act permit. MARS then arranged for the necropsy to be conducted by the Dalhousie shark course, with the support of Chris Harvey-Clark, Dal's veterinarian and one of the course's instructors.\n\nFor over two hours, the team meticulously dissected the shark, searching for any indications of the cause of death while also providing the students with a highly detailed view of the shark's anatomy. The students were able to hold the heart, assist in dissecting certain organs, observe the internal structures of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and thyroid, and examine the brain within its thumb-sized recess. The shark's stomach, distended and full, revealed a small harbour porpoise that had been bitten into large, identifiable, and mostly intact pieces.\n\nAdam Bouma, a fourth-year marine biology student who joined Dalhousie from Belleville, Ontario, specifically for the shark course, expressed his awe, stating, \"To have hands-on experience with such an endangered animal is truly amazing. It's such a large specimen, and we get to learn so much from it. This will provide me with a better understanding and greatly improve my job prospects because now I have experience with a great white shark necropsy. Not many undergraduate students have this opportunity. It's truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience!\"\n\nMoreover, the necropsy will serve as a valuable resource for researchers from various organizations who were provided with dozens of tissue samples to study shark health and other related issues. Typically, researchers seldom have the chance to examine great whites post-mortem, making this opportunity even more exceptional. In the past, reports of dead white sharks in the region were uncommon, with sightings occurring approximately every five years. Last fall, two white sharks were reported to Mar when they washed up in the area and were necropsied, but the causes of their deaths are still unknown.\n\nManuel Dureuil, one of the course instructors who have studied various sharks for years, including in South and West Africa, expressed his gratitude for being part of this unique experience. \"We are doing something that even many shark researchers wouldn't have the chance to participate in. I'm thrilled that the students get to witness this up close,\" he said, observing as Dr. Harvey-Clark guided the class through the dissection, organ by organ. \"This is our ultimate motivation: to provide these 18 highly interested, aspiring marine biologists with a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It connects real hands-on science with the captivating world of sharks.\"\n\nWimmer, who completed her Master of Biology at Dalhousie, believes that witnessing such a necropsy could be the pivotal moment that leads some students to pursue marine studies. She explains, \"For many people, there's often a defining moment in their academic journey where they realize, 'Ah, this is what I'm truly passionate about.' It doesn't surprise me that so many students come to Dalhousie for the chance to experience something like this. Especially for a university with a strong focus on the ocean, offering these field courses is crucial. It greatly enhances the learning experience when students can actively participate in hands-on activities like these.\" END"}

As a Ukrainian student, she believes that the support of supervisors and teachers from around the world is crucial for fulfilling her dreams practically. Currently, Bohdana is working as a summer research intern with Dr. Richard Price and his team at Dalhousie's Faculty of Dentistry. Their research focuses on studying the differences in dental curing lights.\n\nDr. Price is a renowned researcher in the field of dental curing lights and is also a professor in the Department of Dental Clinical Sciences and School of Biomedical Engineering. After completing her dental school in Ukraine, Bohdana decided to pursue her master's degree and explore research opportunities abroad. It was her friend, Yaryna Tylchak, who informed her about Dr. Price's search for a summer intern. Bohdana expressed her interest, and fortunately, Dr. Price offered her the internship. They were able to secure funding through Mitacs Globalink and Research Nova Scotia's Ukrainian Emergency Research Support Program.\n\nBohdana feels immensely grateful for the support she has received from Dr. Price, the lab team, Research Nova Scotia, and Mitacs. She believes that this opportunity is a great chance for personal growth and making a meaningful impact not only on the scientific community but also on practical dental work for those who will benefit from it. Curing lights are essential tools used by dentists every day to cure adhesives, harden white fillings, cement crowns, and bond brackets onto teeth. In 2014 alone, approximately 800 million fillings required the use of a curing light. It is crucial to have a reliable curing light to ensure proper polymerization and prevent premature failure of fillings.\n\nDuring her internship, Bohdana has had the opportunity to explore and test a wide range of curing lights in Dr. Price's laboratory. She has discovered that not all curing lights are created equal and that they can produce different results. Surprisingly, most dentists are unaware of these significant differences and often make purchasing decisions based on factors such as brand, marketing, cost, and warranty period, rather than considering important factors like irradiance, emission spectrum, and beam profile. This lack of awareness among dentists doesn't come as a surprise to Dr. Price, as previous studies have shown that most dentists have limited knowledge about curing lights.\n\nBohdana's three-month stay in Nova Scotia has been made possible with the support of Research Nova Scotia's Ukrainian Emergency Research Support Program, which also provided funding for the necessary research equipment. Stefan Leslie, the CEO of Research Nova Scotia, emphasizes the importance of supporting Ukrainian researchers and highlights that Bohdana's project not only benefits her but also contributes to groundbreaking research. The results of Bohdana's research have the potential to enhance dental practices and improve patient outcomes not only in Nova Scotia and Ukraine but also globally.\n\nWorking alongside Dr. Price, Bohdana has developed skills in measuring the output of curing lights, analyzing their differences, and assessing their outcomes. They plan to submit at least one research article based on Bohdana's work in Canada for publication. Additionally, Dr. Price has arranged for Bohdana to present her research results at a leading dental company, Ultradent, in the United States before she returns to Ukraine to continue her master's program. Bohdana is also excited to share her research at student dental conferences in Ukraine, as she already has experience organizing such events.\n\nBohdana believes that her time in Canada, collaborating with Dr. Price at Dalhousie, is a remarkable opportunity for professional growth and for bringing greater advancements to the dental industry in Ukraine. She is determined to contribute to a better future in her home country, where everyone, whether a scientist, student, or worker, strives every day to make a positive impact. END"}

As an alumna of the University of Toronto's Faculty of Arts & Science, Lepo proudly calls herself a \"nerd\" and is always eager to share her love of science with anyone who will listen. She gets a thrill out of blowing people's minds with mind-blowing scientific discoveries.\n\nLepo earned her PhD from the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics in 2015 and now works as an education and outreach scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, supporting the James Webb Space Telescope. She gets to communicate the incredible discoveries made by the observatory to the rest of the world. At the institute, she works alongside the talented team responsible for the spacecraft's systems, scheduling telescope time for scientists, and recording valuable data.\n\nLepo credits the University of Toronto for helping her develop her skills in public outreach. As a teaching assistant, she learned how to effectively educate and engage large audiences, even when tackling complex theories about the universe. She fondly remembers the extraordinary experience of studying under some of the world's top astronomers in a nurturing environment. When she first arrived in Toronto, she was amazed at the realization that she was attending one of the best universities in the world.\n\nDuring her PhD research, Lepo focused on investigating stars that would eventually explode as supernovae. She aimed to determine whether these explosions were caused by two colliding white dwarf stars or by one star transferring its mass to another. To collect data, she collaborated with telescope operators in Chile and Australia, observing thousands of stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy orbiting the Milky Way. Although her research did not provide proof of supernovae caused by mass transfer, it still made significant contributions to the field.\n\nLepo explains that other astronomers have used supernovae to understand the expansion history of the universe. They discovered that not only is our universe expanding, but it is also accelerating in its expansion. Eventually, galaxies will move so far apart that we will all be living in separate \"island universes.\"\n\nHer PhD adviser, Professor Marten van Kerkwijk, praises Lepo's efficiency and determination in her astronomical research. He believes she should be proud of her accomplishments, and he appreciated the work she did throughout her PhD.\n\nIn 2013, Lepo played a crucial role in organizing the first-ever West African International Summer School for Young Astronomers. This program, partly sponsored by the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA), aimed to support young astronomers in West Africa. Additionally, Lepo established herself as a trusted voice in astronomy during media coverage of the ancient Mayans' doomsday prophecy in 2012. She effectively debunked myths about killer solar flares and runaway planets on a collision course with Earth. Her experience in debunking myths aligned perfectly with her teaching assistant duties in an interdisciplinary class on the apocalypse. The course, titled \"Apocalypse: An Interdisciplinary Approach,\" brought together experts from astronomy, English, and sociology to explore the topic from different angles.\n\nThroughout her academic journey, Lepo has received recognition for her achievements both in and outside the classroom. In 2014, she was honored with the Fieldus Award, given to one graduate student annually for their excellence in leadership, teaching, and research.\n\nAlthough Lepo has taught physics at Gonzaga University and served as the first coordinator of the McGill Space Institute at McGill University after graduating, she always pays homage to her time at the University of Toronto. One of her favorite memories is setting up solar telescopes in the middle of the St. George campus, encouraging people to safely observe the sun. She reminisces about the excitement of explaining to someone that the sun is larger than the moon, forever blowing their mind. These are the moments she truly loves - when she can share her knowledge and witness the joy of discovery in others. END"}

However, it hasn't been without its challenges. The ongoing $1.5 billion redevelopment has caused some disruptions and faced financial and political difficulties. As a result, it has received mixed reviews from the residents it was intended to benefit.\n\nShauna Brail, an associate professor and director of the Institute for Management & Innovation at the University of Toronto Mississauga, recognizes the improvements that have been made in Regent Park. She believes that the neighborhood today is better than it was in 1999 or 2006. However, she also acknowledges that the project has encountered various problems along the way and hasn't achieved all of its intended goals.\n\nBrail, an economic geographer and urban planner, has been studying the Regent Park redevelopment since it began in 2006. Together with journalist and University of Toronto alumnus John Lorinc, she recently published an examination of the project in the Journal of Planning Education and Research.\n\nOriginally built as public housing in the late 1940s, Regent Park's housing had fallen into disrepair by the 1990s, and the neighborhood was facing issues related to crime and stigma. At the same time, funding for social housing from the federal government had decreased, while land values had increased. The Toronto Community Housing Corp. (TCHC) decided to finance the redevelopment through a mix of market-priced housing sales and profits used to finance new subsidized housing. The vision was to create a mixed-income neighborhood with a strong sense of community and shared amenities.\n\nDuring the reconstruction, existing tenants were temporarily relocated but were offered the right to return. About half of them have chosen to come back. Brail was particularly interested in how low-income residents could influence the redevelopment process. She observed that the community empowered themselves by providing input on planning and advocating for funds to be allocated for parks, social centers, jobs, and training. However, the community is divided in their assessment of the outcomes so far.\n\nBrail and Lorinc's paper outlines the political, financial, and social complexities that have delayed the project, including the tenure of the late Mayor Rob Ford, who promised to cut spending. As a result, the redevelopment is currently five to eight years behind schedule, with two of five phases unfinished.\n\nBrail is interested in how the increasing value of downtown real estate influenced the approach to public housing. The reliance on financialization, or the ability for projects to finance themselves, didn't cover the full cost of Regent Park's redevelopment. The three levels of government have collectively contributed about $500 million so far. One of the major lessons from this project is that redevelopment comes with a price. The financialized model alone is not sufficient, and governments need to continue finding ways to fund public housing.\n\nOverall, while the redevelopment of Regent Park has faced challenges and has not fully met all expectations, it has brought positive changes to the neighborhood. It is a testament to the resilience and determination of the community, and it serves as a reminder that ongoing efforts and investments are necessary to support and improve public housing. END"}
{"prompt":"nuclear medicine was first developed in the 1950s as a cancer treatment before shifting to primarily being used as a diagnostic tool , using tiny amounts of radioactive substances to image different parts of the body . now , nearly three quarters of a century later , the field is coming full circle as researchers like raymond reilly , a professor in the university of toronto’s leslie dan faculty of pharmacy , explore options for new cancer therapies . reilly is a leader in developing radiopharmaceuticals that combine radioactive isotopes with highly specific targeting agents to precisely deliver radiation to tumours . his work focuses specifically on radiopharmaceuticals that have “theranostic” properties – useful for both the imaging and treatment of cancer . “radiopharmaceuticals are unique in that you can use the radiopharmaceutical for diagnostic imaging purposes , but you can also use the same agent , sometimes at a higher dose or labelled with a different radioisotope , to treat the cancer , ” says reilly . “and you can then use that same radiopharmaceutical to image the patient again after treatment to see if that patient responded to the treatment . ” cancer researchers and pharmaceutical companies have become more interested in the field after two radiopharmaceuticals were developed and used to successfully treat neuroendocrine cancer and prostate cancer . “these are the vanguard or leading edge of this type of radiopharmaceuticals , but they are really just the tip of the iceberg of what is possible with radiopharmaceuticals , ” says reilly . “radiopharmaceuticals used to be a specialized area of medical research with a small group of dedicated scientists , but it’s starting to emerge as a new cancer treatment that could overcome resistance to other treatments . ” however , reilly explains that the current availability of radioisotopes suitable for cancer therapy is extremely limited . the project is led by françois bénard , an internationally recognized leader in nuclear medicine , at the bc cancer agency , and includes 16 co-investigators across canada , including reilly , who is the sole u of t co-investigator on the project . the team includes researchers at triumf , canada’s world-leading particle accelerator centre in british columbia that creates medical isotopes , chemists who will study ways of attaching the isotopes to targeting agents and clinical trials specialists who will study the radiopharmaceuticals for the first time in patients . health economists on the team will try to understand how best to implement the radiopharmaceuticals into canada’s health-care system . reilly is leading one component of the research that aims to develop radiopharmaceuticals to image and treat recurrence of head and neck cancer . his team is collaborating with researchers at university health network to test the new radiopharmaceuticals in preclinical models and find ways to detect recurrence early so that it can be effectively treated with radiopharmaceuticals . radiopharmaceuticals have potential to treat breast and brain cancers in addition to the work being done through the nfrf project , reilly and his team have made significant advances with other radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment . for example , reilly’s team developed a radiolabelled version of the breast cancer drug herceptin , which was used in a small clinical trial that examined its treatment for brain metastases of breast cancer . in the trial , the researchers studied whether high-intensity focused ultrasound would allow herceptin to more effectively cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumour . reilly’s radiopharmaceutical was key to imaging if – and where – the drug accumulated in the brain . his team has also been working on developing radiation nanomedicines , which combine radiopharmaceuticals and nanotechnology . they have recently developed radiolabelled gold nanoparticles that , in preclinical models , are able to precisely deliver radioisotopes to brain tumour cells and kill them without harming normal tissue . they have had promising results with these first-generation radiolabelled nanomedicines and are continuing to develop and improve them . as the field grows from a niche specialty to a more widely studied potential cancer treatment , reilly says he is excited about the potential for radiopharmaceuticals to have a significant impact in improving patient outcomes . “one of the transformations that has emerged in recent years is a tremendous resurgence of interest in radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment – not just for imaging – and now combining them into this theranostic concept , ” says reilly . ->","completion":" Nuclear medicine was developed in the 1950s to treat cancer, but it has since become primarily used as a diagnostic tool. It involves using small amounts of radioactive substances to create images of different parts of the body. Now, almost 75 years later, researchers like Raymond Reilly, a professor at the University of Toronto, are exploring new options for cancer therapies. Reilly is a leader in developing radiopharmaceuticals, which combine radioactive isotopes with targeting agents to deliver radiation directly to tumors. His focus is on radiopharmaceuticals with \"theranostic\" properties, meaning they can both image and treat cancer. \n\nRadiopharmaceuticals are unique because they can be used for both diagnosis and treatment. After treatment, they can also be used again to see if the patient responded well. This field has gained more interest from cancer researchers and pharmaceutical companies, especially after the successful treatment of neuroendocrine cancer and prostate cancer using radiopharmaceuticals. Reilly believes these treatments are just the beginning of what can be achieved with radiopharmaceuticals. It used to be a specialized area of research, but now it is emerging as a promising new cancer treatment that could overcome resistance to other therapies.\n\nHowever, the availability of radioisotopes suitable for cancer therapy is currently limited. To address this, a project led by François Bénard, a renowned leader in nuclear medicine, and involving 16 co-investigators across Canada, is working to develop new radiopharmaceuticals. The team includes researchers at TRIUMF, Canada's top particle accelerator center, who create medical isotopes. Chemists will study ways to attach the isotopes to targeting agents, while clinical trials specialists will study the use of radiopharmaceuticals in patients for the first time. Health economists will also determine the best way to integrate these treatments into Canada's healthcare system.\n\nReilly's component of the research focuses on developing radiopharmaceuticals to image and treat recurrence of head and neck cancer. His team is collaborating with researchers at the University Health Network to test these new radiopharmaceuticals in preclinical models and find ways to detect recurrence early for effective treatment. Additionally, radiopharmaceuticals show potential for treating breast and brain cancers.\n\nApart from the NFRF project, Reilly's team has made significant progress with other radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. For example, they developed a radiolabeled version of the breast cancer drug Herceptin and tested its effectiveness in treating brain metastases of breast cancer. They also work on radiation nanomedicines, which combine radiopharmaceuticals with nanotechnology. Their latest development, radiolabeled gold nanoparticles, has shown promise in delivering radioisotopes to brain tumor cells and killing them without harming healthy tissue.\n\nAs the field of radiopharmaceuticals grows from a specialized area to a widely studied potential treatment option, Reilly is thrilled about their potential to greatly improve patient outcomes. The renewed interest in using radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment, not just for imaging, and the concept of theranostics are exciting advancements in the field. END"}

They explore what governments, corporations, and individuals can do to address this urgent issue. With all the distressing news about the climate, how can we manage our anxiety? The host of the podcast brings an energetic and passionate tone to the conversation, and the opinions shared by the group are heartfelt and genuine.\n\nWhat's impressive is that the person responsible for writing, producing, interviewing, and creating the music for the episode is not a U of T professor, administrator, or undergrad. Instead, it's Elijah Miller, a grade 12 student who participated in a program called Support, Engage, Experience U of T (SEE U of T). This program aims to give youth from historically under-represented communities a taste of university life. Miller expresses his justified pride in the opportunity he had to contribute to the podcast episode. He explains, \"I came up with the questions, edited—everything. It was super-awesome.\"\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with the Toronto District School Board and run by Woodsworth College since 2019, the SEE U of T program has recently expanded to cover all three campuses. It invites local grade 11 and 12 students to complete a first-year U of T course at no cost. In addition to the academic experience, participants also have the opportunity to do a co-op placement, receive mentoring from a senior-year undergrad, and explore the university's facilities and services. Through this program, they can earn two high school co-op credits and a half-credit toward a university degree.\n\nThe aim of this program is to remove barriers created by structural and historical inequities and provide pathways to post-secondary education. Ann Lopez, U of T's provostial advisor on access programs, emphasizes that U of T not only wants to attract traditionally under-represented students but also wants them to feel a sense of belonging at the university. This vision for the program was developed in collaboration with Woodsworth's then-assistant principal and registrar, Cheryl Shook, and principals and staff at the participating high schools, Runnymede Collegiate Institute and Downsview Secondary School.\n\nU of T has been actively working to create a more welcoming environment for black students. In 2020, the university established the U of T Institutional Anti-Black Racism Task Force, which made 56 recommendations to promote black inclusion and excellence. The university has accepted all of these recommendations and has implemented many of them, with ongoing work on others.\n\nParticipants in SEE U of T can choose from a range of 16 courses and have access to academic support from instructors, teaching assistants, an academic advisor dedicated to their cohort, and a learning strategist at Woodsworth's Academic Writing Centre. The program also offers various co-op placement options at academic and administrative sites. Tuition fees and books are covered by U of T, while student supports such as bus tickets and meals are typically provided by the school board.\n\nNatasha Jesenak, the Director of Access Programs and Registrarial Services at Woodsworth, highlights the program's role in leveling the playing field for learning opportunities and contributing to a more inclusive society. Over the course of three cohorts, more than 50 high school students have participated in SEE U of T. While participation was lower during the pandemic due to online activities, the program will be fully in-person this upcoming fall.\n\nU of T Mississauga also introduced its own version of SEE U of T in partnership with the Peel District School Board and two participating schools, Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School and Meadowvale Secondary School. This program, called SEE UTM, offers a course focused on critical thinking in science and technology. Alongside valuable academic skills, participants also learn important life skills such as workload management and effective communication. Workshops on topics like discovering personal strengths and personal finance were also provided. Mentees received 20 hours of one-on-one mentorship from an undergrad, with mentor Tobi Mohammed, a fourth-year student in biology for health sciences, offering guidance on time management, creating LinkedIn profiles, and applying to university. Mohammed reflects on the impact of the program, stating, \"We talked about their ambitions and goals, their personal struggles – we talked about everything. As someone who is black, I wish I'd had something like this in first year.\"\n\nOverall, the SEE U of T program provides a unique opportunity for high school students from under-represented communities to gain exposure to university life and experience the support and resources available to them. The program's expansion and impact reflect U of T's commitment to inclusivity and creating pathways to higher education. END"}

This was certainly the case for Christina Guzzo, who sought out the best mentor to further her training as she finished her PhD. Her goal was to experience what it's like to be on the cutting edge, and she knew that working with Anthony Fauci's research team would provide just that. \n\nBefore becoming the face of the U.S. government's COVID-19 response, Fauci led the world-renowned HIV research center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Guzzo, whose research focused on HIV infection, approached him at an AIDS conference. Despite already having an impressive body of published research, Fauci agreed to interview her for one of the competitive post-doctoral positions at the research center. He was immediately struck by her intelligence, energy, and commitment. Fauci describes her as extremely bright with a sense of purpose to make a positive impact through science and alleviate suffering and death. He hired her, and Guzzo hit the ground running, contributing to HIV research over the next five years. \n\nWhile it was always clear that Guzzo wanted to return to Canada, Fauci would have welcomed her staying in his lab indefinitely, as she proved to be a productive, insightful, and creative scientist. Now, Guzzo herself is a mentor. Since leaving the National Institutes of Health, she has been running her own lab as a professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She recognizes the pivotal role mentorship plays in shaping opportunities, especially for young women who may feel excluded or biased against. Guzzo feels it's important for her students to hear that she believes in them and knows they can succeed. She also volunteers for a program called Sparking Science, where she mentors high school girls interested in science and technology careers. Guzzo is open with her students about the need to prioritize family issues, encouraging them to feel comfortable taking time off when necessary. \n\nMentorship has become a significant part of Guzzo's life, but it wasn't always that way. Throughout high school and her undergraduate years, she had no science mentors. In fact, she almost pursued a career in basketball instead. As the child of blue-collar Italian immigrants, sports played a big role in her life. However, during her undergraduate studies at Queen's University, she discovered a student-run charitable organization focused on HIV\/AIDS education. This sparked her interest in combining travel, working with children, and science. She spent three summers in Kenya developing curricula on HIV and youth empowerment for schools in informal settlements near Nairobi. Little did she know, she was also learning how to teach. \n\nIt wasn't until Guzzo met Katrina Gee, a friendly and young professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Queen's University, that she found her first science mentor. Over the next five years, Guzzo produced significant research and learned from Gee the importance of having fun along the way. They celebrated not only major accomplishments but also the smaller victories, like when an experiment went well. END"}

the University of Toronto and physicians at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children is revolutionizing the way heart rhythm abnormalities are diagnosed in critically ill children. Taking inspiration from artificial intelligence systems used to detect earthquakes, this innovative approach combines the expertise of clinicians at SickKids with specially trained AI to provide faster and more accurate diagnoses of heart problems. The potential impact is enormous, not only improving the health outcomes of vulnerable patients but also alleviating the strain on our healthcare system.\n\nWhen the heart functions properly, it beats to a regular rhythm that we can observe on a heart monitor. However, when the heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow, or irregular, it can lead to severe complications and even death. Shockingly, almost one in three children admitted to an intensive care unit at SickKids experience heart rhythm abnormalities, affecting up to 700 children each year. These patients require constant monitoring, placing a significant burden on hospital staff who are simultaneously caring for other children.\n\nThe challenge lies in the fact that clinicians cannot always monitor every bedside continuously. This can result in delayed detection or diagnosis of abnormal heart rhythms, which can lead to worse outcomes for the patients. But fear not, because Dr. Sebastian Goodfellow from the University of Toronto's Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering and Dr. Mjaye Mazwi, SickKids' director of Translational Engineering in Critical-Care Medicine, are working tirelessly to develop a solution that will revolutionize the field.\n\nDr. Goodfellow's previous experience in building AI models to analyze geological data made him the perfect partner for Dr. Mazwi, who had a vision of utilizing AI to detect heart arrhythmias in the hospital setting. Together, they are training an AI system to recognize the early warning signs of arrhythmias, using the expertise of clinicians and analyzing over 10,000 electrocardiogram readings. This vast amount of data far exceeds what even the most experienced clinicians encounter during their careers. Before deploying the AI system with patients, it must match or surpass the performance of a clinician and accurately alert medical staff when it detects arrhythmia warning signs.\n\nDr. Mazwi emphasizes that their goal is not to replace clinicians but rather to combine the power of AI with human intelligence to achieve superior results. They firmly believe that clinicians who embrace AI will outperform those who do not. Initially, the researchers are focusing on a specific type of irregular cardiac activity called junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET), which is challenging to detect due to subtle changes in the patient's electrocardiogram. Timely detection and treatment of JET significantly reduce the risk of injury or death, benefiting both the patient and the healthcare system as a whole.\n\nIn the long run, the research team aims to develop AI models capable of detecting every type of heart rhythm anomaly. While AI is rapidly advancing in various fields, the implementation process in healthcare requires caution and thorough testing. AI models must be extensively evaluated to ensure they enhance patient outcomes and overall performance in the healthcare system before being used on actual patients. The U of T and SickKids researchers are collaborating with clinicians and researchers from other pediatric hospitals in England, Israel, and Australia to test their AI models on different patient populations. Their ultimate objectives are to determine the efficacy of the models in other hospitals and lay the foundation for widespread adoption beyond Canada.\n\nThis remarkable partnership between engineers and physicians is set to revolutionize the diagnosis of heart rhythm abnormalities in critically ill children. By harnessing the power of AI, the researchers are creating a game-changing solution that will not only improve the health outcomes of vulnerable patients but also alleviate the strain on our healthcare system. With their efforts focused on detecting and treating junctional ectopic tachycardia and aiming to expand their AI models to cover all heart rhythm anomalies, the possibilities for transforming pediatric cardiac care are endless.

So far, his team has managed to reconstruct 913 years. But he wants to go even further back in time. To do this, they search for dead trees that are preserved in lakes or mud deposits. By matching the ring pattern of these dead trees with living trees from the same area, they can accurately date the dead trees.\n\nIt's a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle, but it's a painstaking process. Researchers compare the growth patterns on the outer layers of the dead trees to those of the living trees to find a match.

{"prompt":"for many canadians , climate change is nothing but bad news wildfires , flooding , icebergs melting and heat waves . worse still , for many , the solutions can seem more painful than the problem drive or fly less while paying more for gas and energy . it’s no wonder then , that canada’s progress on climate change is incremental at best . but recently , activists and progressive politicians have breathed new life into climate politics by proposing a green new deal a massive mobilization of government resources to decarbonize society while providing workers in carbon-based industries with the services and support they need to prosper . this reframing of climate change solutions as a win-win , rather than a lose-lose , has gained traction with people of diverse interests – from politicians to labour union leaders to rabbis . ideas related to the green new deal have been floating around for a decade or so , and centre on the idea that environmental problems are not just about “the environment . ” they are about people too . as such , the environment is linked to problems of economic inequality and social injustice , for two reasons . first , families living in poverty , people of colour and indigenous peoples suffer disproportionately from pollution and fossil fuel extraction . for example , in canada , many indigenous peoples have objected strenuously to the trans mountain pipeline on the grounds that it could harm waterways and wildlife , disturb sacred sites and foul the land they seek to protect . low-income communities are also more likely to suffer environmental harms . according to the canadian institute for health information , one-quarter of canada’s poorest live within one kilometre of a pollution-emitting facility . second , linking climate with justice and equality – by creating more opportunities for people to earn a living wage and correcting the radical income inequality that has surged over the last few decades – can help build broad political coalitions to support aggressive action . in contrast to the u . s . , where the green new deal is a resolution in the house of representatives , there is no single green new deal for canada . instead , it is a patchwork of proposals coming from different corners . the ndp has crafted “a new deal for climate action and good jobs , ” which calls for urgent action on climate change as well as the creation of 300 , 000 green jobs across the country . it promises other financial benefits such as reduced energy expenditures through efficiency upgrades and cheaper ( and perhaps even free ) public transport . however , the ndp plan is conspicuously silent on what to do about fossil fuel production beyond pledging to “support workers” so that “the changing economy works for them . ” finally , activists and civil society have their own proposals . in may 2019 , more than 100 groups launched a pact for a green new deal , which sets the ambitious goal of halving canadian emissions in 11 years “while protecting cultural and biological diversity . ” the centrepiece of canadian climate policy is the pan canadian framework on clean growth and climate change . while carbon pricing is central to the framework , it has proven controversial ontario premier doug ford and alberta premier jason kenney were quick to repeal carbon pricing laws once elected . and premier scott moe will challenge its legality in saskatchewan . recent court rulings indicate that carbon pricing is here to stay , but in the meantime , it has become a political football . moreover , justin trudeau has said that the price will be capped at $50 per tonne , which is too low to drive the kind of change we need . to meet canada’s commitments under the paris agreement , we need to make a wholesale economic transition . the green new deal offers ideas for this transition that are both environmentally sustainable and economically and socially just . federal policies are needed to help create new jobs for those who would be affected by closing the tar sands . these policies could take a variety of forms . federal procurement policies could drive demand for carbon-neutral electricity and buildings , and the production and installation of the requisite technology . new standards for generating renewable electricity would create incentives to build more capacity . investments in grid upgrades would also create more jobs . at the same time , tightening emissions regulations would slow the use of fossil fuels . of course , not all workers can be retrained . in these cases , the federal government must be honest and generous . buyouts will be needed , and pensions should be guaranteed . provinces have neither the incentive nor the capital to implement such policies , so the federal government would have to step in . ->","completion":" Climate change can feel like a never-ending stream of bad news for many Canadians. From wildfires and flooding to melting icebergs and heatwaves, the problems seem overwhelming. On top of that, the solutions can sometimes seem even more painful than the problem itself. Asking people to drive or fly less and pay more for gas and energy can feel like a burden. It's no wonder that Canada's progress on climate change has been slow.\n\nBut there's a new wave of hope on the horizon. Activists and progressive politicians are proposing a Green New Deal, a bold plan to decarbonize society while also supporting workers in carbon-based industries. This new approach reframes climate change solutions as win-win opportunities instead of lose-lose situations. And it's gaining support from a diverse range of people, including politicians, labor union leaders, and religious leaders.\n\nThe idea behind the Green New Deal is not just about the environment, but also about people. It recognizes that environmental problems are connected to economic inequality and social injustice. For instance, families living in poverty, people of color, and indigenous peoples are disproportionately affected by pollution and fossil fuel extraction. Indigenous communities, for example, have strongly opposed pipelines that could harm their water, wildlife, and sacred sites. Low-income communities are also more likely to suffer from environmental harm.\n\nBy linking climate change with justice and equality, there's an opportunity to create more economic opportunities for everyone and address the income inequality that has been growing. This approach can help build broad political coalitions to support aggressive action on climate change.\n\nAlthough there isn't a single Green New Deal for Canada like the one in the U.S., there are various proposals coming from different groups. The NDP, for example, has crafted \"A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs,\" which calls for urgent climate action and the creation of 300,000 green jobs across the country. Their plan also promises financial benefits such as reduced energy expenses through efficiency upgrades and more affordable public transportation.\n\nActivists and civil society groups have also launched their own proposals, such as the Pact for a Green New Deal, which aims to cut Canadian emissions in half while protecting cultural and biological diversity.\n\nHowever, there are challenges in implementing these proposals. The pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change, which is a key part of Canada's climate policy, has faced controversy with some politicians repealing carbon pricing laws. Despite this, recent court rulings indicate that carbon pricing is here to stay, although there is room for improvement. To meet Canada's commitments under the Paris Agreement, a significant economic transition is needed.\n\nThe Green New Deal offers environmentally sustainable and economically and socially just ideas for this transition. Federal policies can help create new jobs for those affected by the closure of tar sands, and investments in carbon-neutral electricity and buildings can drive economic growth. By tightening emissions regulations and investing in grid upgrades, we can reduce the use of fossil fuels and create even more job opportunities.\n\nOf course, not all workers can be retrained, and in those cases, the federal government must be honest and generous. Buyouts and guaranteed pensions can help support those who are unable to transition to new industries. Since provinces may not have the capacity or incentive to implement these policies, the federal government would need to step in.\n\nWith a collective effort and the right policies in place, we can tackle climate change while also creating a fairer and more prosperous society for all Canadians. The Green New Deal offers a path forward that benefits both the environment and the people. END"}
{"prompt":"early in january , jair bolsonaro was sworn in as the president of brazil . he ascended to the highest office of south america’s largest country through a visceral campaign that targeted political elites , minorities , women and members of the lgbtq community , and used social media to rally support from far-right nationalists . on his first day in office , he issued a number of executive orders to restrict the rights of minority groups . with a few significant variations , bolsonaro’s story is similar to donald trump’s in the u . s . , viktor orbán’s in hungary , marine le pen’s in france , the five star movement’s in italy and brexit . protectionist , anti-immigrant nationalists are tearing down the post-second world war consensus on the importance of pluralism and the free movement of goods and people . around the world , liberal democratic values are in retreat . to understand why , we must look to the working and middle classes , who are concerned their jobs may be automated or moved to lower-cost countries . to calm these fears , nationalist politicians are offering to protect jobs with seemingly simple solutions such as trade barriers . 1 at the same time , they’re painting the political , business and media elites as puppets of foreign interests , reinforcing the idea that only they can protect the less-educated workers . only they can protect citizens from the impacts of free trade and migration . 2 they stoke anxiety about migration 3– to the point that their anti-immigrant position is their defining feature . these nationalist leaders have become experts at getting this message out . using largely anonymous platforms such as twitter and facebook , they craft posts that tap into the emotive power of nationalism – unique in its ability to mobilize people to act in constructive but also irrational and frightening ways . nationalism is one of the few ideas , along with religion , that moves people to fight – and even die – on behalf of people they have never met . as part of a research project , a colleague and i read all of trump’s tweets – more than 5 , 000 in total – during the 2016 election campaign . in almost half of them , he presents himself as the protector of “true americans” against mexican migrants , muslims and political elites . in comparison , he tweeted about policy issues such as health care , taxes and the supreme court fewer than 100 times each . this strategy was central to his success 57 per cent of white americans voted for him . beating back the rising forces of ethnic nationalism won’t be simple . it will require long-term , fundamental social and political changes and also short-term adjustments to how we participate in politics . we can start by reducing the anxieties of the working and middle classes through policies that bolster the social safety net , reduce inequality and help prepare and retrain workers for jobs in the information-based economy . pilot studies testing the effects of a universal basic income show promise . these programs provide workers with a guaranteed level of income regardless of their employment , which allows them to withstand losing a job and gives them support to retrain for a new one . what continues to motivate support for brexit is the view that the european union doesn’t adequately represent the interests of the regular british citizen . a similar mistrust of government , or cynicism about politics , exists in many other countries . advocates for immigration need to convey to the public how logical , managed and well-resourced selection and settlement policies benefit both migrants and the host society . in canada , there’s broad support for immigration largely because of our long-standing points-based model and a commitment to language training for recent migrants . america and many european states face high volumes of refugees and irregular immigration . but there , too , a process that selects highly skilled migrants could help alleviate fears that they weaken the economy and could buy public support for a more generous immigration policy . governments should hold social media platforms such as facebook and twitter responsible for the content their users post , just as they do mainstream publishers and broadcasters . in other words , social media should be regulated . some suggest that to defeat nationalism , we should partly embrace what nationalists are saying . supporters of this approach call for protectionist economic policies , less immigration , and more programs aimed at boosting the national culture . 4 they believe we need to take what nationalists are saying seriously in order to effectively address the grievances of many majority groups around the world , including trump’s “true americans . ” ->","completion":" In January, Jair Bolsonaro became the President of Brazil. He won the election by connecting with people through social media and addressing their concerns. On his first day in office, he made some changes that affected minority groups. This kind of rise to power is not unique to Bolsonaro - we have seen similar situations with leaders like Donald Trump in the US, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Marine Le Pen in France, the Five-Star Movement in Italy, and the Brexit movement. These nationalist leaders are challenging the idea of diversity and the free movement of goods and people that has been important since World War II. Liberal democratic values are facing challenges around the world.\n\nTo understand why this is happening, we need to consider the worries of working and middle-class people who fear losing their jobs to automation or outsourcing to cheaper countries. Nationalist politicians offer straightforward solutions like trade barriers to protect jobs. They also portray the political, business, and media elites as puppets of foreign interests, implying that only they can protect the less-educated workers and citizens from the effects of free trade and migration. They create anxiety around immigration to the point that it becomes their main focus. These nationalist leaders are skilled at spreading their message through platforms like Twitter and Facebook, evoking the emotions associated with nationalism. Nationalism, along with religion, has the power to mobilize people to fight and even die for complete strangers.\n\nTo tackle the rise of ethnic nationalism, we need both long-term social and political changes and immediate adjustments to our political engagement. To alleviate the concerns of working and middle-class people, we should implement policies that strengthen the social safety net, reduce inequality, and provide support for retraining in the information-based economy. Pilot studies on universal basic income show promise in helping workers transition to new jobs. In order to address the mistrust of government in many countries, advocates for immigration should explain how logical and well-managed immigration policies benefit both migrants and the host society. Canada's points-based model and commitment to language training for migrants have garnered broad support for immigration.\n\nCountries facing high volumes of refugees and irregular immigration could consider adopting a selection process that prioritizes highly skilled migrants to alleviate fears of a weakened economy and gain public support for more generous immigration policies. Governments should hold social media platforms accountable for the content posted by their users, just as they do with mainstream publishers and broadcasters, by regulating social media. Some argue that to combat nationalism, we should partially embrace certain aspects of nationalist discourse, such as protectionist economic policies, controlled immigration, and programs that promote national culture. This approach acknowledges the grievances of majority groups worldwide, including Trump's \"true Americans.\" END"}
{"prompt":"in 1998 , opentext was in the business of internet search when a small startup called google came along . below , jenkins – at the time the company’s ceo – writes about how opentext’s failure against google allowed the company to “pivot” and become one of the world’s largest software and cloud companies . opentext originally set out to be the primary search engine of the internet and it failed . from a canadian point of view that’s very important , because part of the dilemma we have in canadian innovation , invention and competition is that we shy away from failure . if somebody fails , we avoid looking that person in the eye . it’s a stigma . opentext’s stock price collapsed from $20 to $2 in less than six months . it was a very public failure . at the time , articles about the collapse of our business model and the abandonment of our search engine were appearing in various newspapers – not unlike the articles that have been published about the decline of blackberry , nortel and valeant . my friends in waterloo , ontario , my family , and other people i know in canada lost large amounts of money on opentext stock . when you take the garbage out to the end of your driveway , and realize that many of the homes you see belong to people who lost a good chunk of their money because of your failure , it’s very personal and very painful . what came out of that failure ? opentext turned to business-to-business applications , which was a less competitive market but no less lucrative than the public-facing business of search engines we moved out of . opentext was far more profitable in the long run . however , if we had not failed with our first strategy , re-¬evaluated and pivoted when we did , we never would have realized this success . this is , i hope , the single most important learning no matter what happens , you must stick it out , adapt , evaluate and pivot with confidence because , on your 131st try , it’s going to work . successful entrepreneurs are actually serial failures . thomas edison is perhaps the greatest serial failure in the modern era – but we don’t think of him that way . we think of him as a successful entrepreneur and as a successful inventor . in fact , he failed time after time . he used his failures as opportunities to learn what didn’t work . failures are part of the journey toward success . as edison and so many other innovators have proven , to fail is not the worst thing that can happen . but canadians are myopic about it . canadian companies such as nortel and research in motion have had very public collapses . so have many others . the reality is that failure is going on all the time , and it is part of the innovation process . at opentext , we were fortunate to change direction in the nick of time . opentext was able to take some of its resources , some of its money , and the technologies that it had built , repurpose them to a different market and a different application , and succeed . our failure was only temporary , since the pivot proved to be the right decision . that would not become apparent , though , until many years later . opentext began to grow in its new business and went on to be the market leader in designing and building software for corporate intranets and the cloud . today , opentext is one of the largest software and cloud companies in the world and never left its home in waterloo . today its headquarters for more than 12 , 000 people is located just a few steps away from where its first internet search product , opentext index , was created in 1995 . ->","completion":" Back in 1998, OpenText was focused on internet search when a small startup called Google came onto the scene. In this article, Jenkins, who was OpenText's CEO at the time, shares how OpenText's failure against Google actually turned out to be a positive turning point for the company. OpenText initially set out to be the main search engine of the internet, but unfortunately, it didn't succeed. From a Canadian perspective, this is significant because we tend to avoid failure in our innovation and competition. When someone fails, we tend to shy away from them, creating a stigma around failure.\n\nOpenText experienced a very public failure, with their stock price dropping drastically in just a matter of months. It was a challenging time, and many people in Waterloo, Ontario, including Jenkins' friends and family, lost a substantial amount of money on OpenText stock. The personal and financial impact was significant.\n\nHowever, from this failure, OpenText was able to pivot and turn to business-to-business applications, which proved to be a less competitive but equally profitable market compared to the public-facing search engine business they had moved away from. In the long run, OpenText became far more profitable. But none of this success would have been possible if OpenText hadn't failed, reevaluated their strategy, and made the necessary changes. This is a crucial lesson to remember – no matter what happens, it's essential to stick it out, adapt, evaluate, and pivot with confidence because eventually, it will lead to success.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs are actually serial failures. Look at Thomas Edison, for example – he failed time after time, but we consider him a successful entrepreneur and inventor. Failures are simply stepping stones on the path to success. And yet, Canadians tend to have a narrow view of failure. Companies like Nortel and Research in Motion have experienced very public collapses, but the reality is that failure is a natural part of the innovation process. It happens all the time. OpenText was fortunate enough to change direction just in time. They were able to repurpose their resources, money, and technology to a different market and application, ultimately leading to success. Their failure was only temporary, as their pivot turned out to be the right decision, but it took many years for that to become apparent.\n\nToday, OpenText is one of the largest software and cloud companies in the world and has remained rooted in Waterloo. Their headquarters, where over 12,000 people work, is just a few steps away from where their first internet search product, OpenText Index, was created in 1995. END"}

Being in Toronto at the time, there wasn't much I could do to directly help, but I wanted to express my condemnation for the shooter on social media. Unfortunately, this simple gesture led to me receiving hate messages from hundreds of Muslims worldwide. As an openly gay Muslim, this experience highlighted the challenges I face in life.\n\nOne man wrote a tweet saying, \"I'm sad you weren't in the club in Orlando,\" adding a smiley at the end with the message \"have a nice day.\" Another person wished for me to get hit by a bus, and someone else threatened me with stoning. These hurtful messages left me feeling scared of the Muslim community, even though I know that acts of terror do not reflect the true teachings of Islam.\n\nWith over 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, I understand that the vast majority are non-violent and peaceful, just like me. However, as a gay man, I have personally experienced the pervasive homophobia within the Muslim community, which makes it difficult for me to find solace in this fact. Muslims cannot claim Islam to be the religion of peace if it fosters homophobia. By being the religion of homophobia, innocent lives are lost, not only due to acts of terror committed by individuals like Omar Mateen but also because LGBTQ Muslims are driven to hate themselves.\n\nGrowing up, I found it easy to deny my homosexuality. My immigrant parents raised me with their traditional Bangladeshi Muslim values, where practices like consuming pork, alcohol, and heterosexual dating were prohibited. When I moved to the University of Toronto for my undergraduate studies, I realized how deeply ingrained this homophobia was within me. Seeing rainbow-colored \"positive space\" stickers on campus made me disgusted, questioning why there were so many openly queer individuals who were unashamed of their identity.\n\nWhat I didn't understand then, and what many Muslims still struggle to grasp, is that being LGBTQ and openly proud forces us to empathize with others. In the Muslim community, few people are courageous enough to come out, making LGBTQ issues seem like a distant \"Western\" problem. It's easy to hate something that feels abstract. However, when I was confronted with open and proud LGBTQ individuals, I had to choose between hate and love. I chose love, even when I couldn't fully accept myself as gay. I made this choice because Allah, in Islam, is associated with love, not bigotry, hate, or homophobia.\n\nMany Muslims take pride in their racial and religious identity, despite facing racism and Islamophobia. Similarly, LGBTQ individuals also hold pride in their identity, even though they encounter homophobia, transphobia, and biphobia. The act of terrorism committed by Omar Mateen reminds us that being openly gay and proud can still come at a high cost, even within the Muslim community. As a proud and openly gay Muslim, I am aware that I am a target within this community. It may even cost me my life one day. However, by remaining open and proud of who I am, I force Muslims to choose. They must choose between loving me or hating me. If they choose love, they will recognize that both the gay community and the Muslim community share common truths. We both value the sanctity of life and desire a world filled with tolerance. END"}

I studied development projects in Sri Lanka, took courses in classical history and archaeology in Italy, taught in England, and created art in Portugal. I was proud of my adventures and marked each new destination on a world map as a personal accomplishment. However, I also became fascinated by the fact that this map wouldn't exist if it weren't for the brave explorers who ventured into the unknown and documented their discoveries.\n\nWhen I arrived at U of T in 1988, I met Alex Jones, a classics professor who seemed to understand my curiosity. He suggested that I delve into the history of cartography, which immediately sparked my interest. During my time at U of T's Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, I had the wonderful opportunity to conduct years of research on the medieval period's history of maps and exploration.\n\nEarly maps not only depicted lands and seas but also revealed how ancient civilizations perceived the world. Their maps were often based on exploration, but also on myth, rumors, and speculation. After graduating, I stumbled upon a set of rare early maps and texts owned by a private collector. These maps fascinated me because of their unique background. They had been brought to the United States by an Italian immigrant named Marcian F. Rossi and were now in the possession of one of his descendants. Rossi's Italian lineage traced back to an admiral who had known Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant famous for his extensive travels across Asia from 1271 to 1295.\n\nThese maps had been briefly mentioned in a 1940s article but had never been thoroughly studied, so I seized the opportunity to investigate further. This marked the beginning of years of intense research and analysis, including the challenging task of translating fragments of Latin, medieval Italian, and even Chinese found on the documents. The maps themselves were created with ink on vellum and provided a previously unknown account of Marco Polo's journey. One of the texts mentioned a \"land of frost\" and \"sea lions\" and referred to the far reaches of Northeast Asia, which some maps seemed to depict as well – a region not mentioned in the traditional Marco Polo narrative. The same text also described a \"remote peninsula washed by the seas\" where the people lived in caves due to freezing. These descriptions, along with certain depictions on the maps, hinted at early knowledge of the western shores of North America, possibly predating Columbus by two centuries. The documents even suggested charting of the Northern Pacific Ocean and perhaps parts of Alaska, long before the first Russian expeditions took place there.\n\nThe sheer quantity of materials, including 14 maps and texts, and the numerous connections within and between them made the investigation even more intriguing and complex. With the recent publication of my book, \"The Mysteries of the Marco Polo Maps\" in 2014, a wider audience now has the chance to appreciate the beauty and complexity of these maps, as well as the important role that merchants and explorers like Marco Polo played in expanding our knowledge of distant lands. I like to believe that my own travels, which eventually took me to Asia after graduate school, are a reflection of Polo's curiosity about the world beyond his humble origins. END"}

My parents would often switch from church to church, searching for one that felt right for us. Every Sunday morning, it was a struggle for my parents to convince me to go with them. I'm not sure if it was because of my rebellious nature as a teenager or if I genuinely didn't enjoy going to church, or maybe it was a combination of both. Regardless, I grew up with a dismissive attitude towards religion and at times, even felt resentful towards it.\n\nHowever, I always maintained a curiosity about those who held religion deeply important in their lives. Little did I know that this curiosity would lead me to become a journalist covering this very topic. It all began when I started my undergraduate degree at Trinity College in 2008. I enrolled in a course on religion and human rights, which introduced me to the concept of the Dhammayietra. These annual peace walks, led by Cambodian Buddhist monks, were initiated in 1992 to bring order to a nation devastated by the Khmer Rouge regime.\n\nLearning about the Dhammayietra challenged my preconceived notions about religion. It shed light on the complex factors that shape religious beliefs and revealed their powerful potential for cultivating peace during times of despair. After completing the course, I made the decision to change my major from English to religion and began to reconsider my lifelong dream of attending law school. Although I wasn't certain what my future career would look like, I knew that I wanted it to be somehow connected to religion.\n\nDuring my final year, I had the opportunity to intern at the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. This organization aims to combat extremism by utilizing religion as a positive force. I assisted with their interfaith fellowship program called Faiths Act, where people from different religious and non-religious backgrounds worked together on community projects related to the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. Despite criticism directed towards Mr. Blair, especially in light of his involvement in Middle East affairs and the news of the World phone hacking scandal, I still believe in the value of his efforts to foster religion as a force for good.\n\nInspired by the foundation's work on human rights, I pursued a master's degree in human rights at the London School of Economics in 2012. For my dissertation, I focused on Christian efforts to combat human trafficking in the United States. It is a highly debated issue where significant attention and funding are directed, but the effectiveness of these efforts is still in question. During my field research, I heard compelling and often heart-wrenching stories from human trafficking survivors and individuals working in anti-human trafficking organizations. Although I included some of these stories in my final paper, I felt unsatisfied confining them to the realm of academia.\n\nThis realization led me to consider journalism as an ideal path to combine my research on religion with my desire to reach a wider audience. Last May, I completed the fellowship in global journalism at the Munk School of Global Affairs. During this program, I reported for various media outlets, including the National Post and Vice, on the use of religion in combating and, at times, contributing to human trafficking. I covered stories that highlighted the unconventional side of religion, such as an American internet-based church that evangelizes at porn shows worldwide, as well as the inspiring side, like a Catholic group successfully helping thousands of refugees become Canadian citizens.\n\nCurrently, I am investigating forced marriages within religious communities in Canada. With each new project, I grow more confident in my decision to write about religion for as wide an audience as possible. Modern religions are continuously evolving and becoming increasingly intertwined with politics worldwide. Journalists play a vital role in ensuring that the entire story is told. END"}

It has been successfully installed on NASA's Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft at Lockheed Martin Space in Colorado, USA. This state-of-the-art camera, supported by the UK Space Agency, will provide detailed maps of the lunar surface temperature and composition with a resolution of around 50 meters.\n\nTogether with the spacecraft's High-Resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3), the LTM will play a crucial role in determining the abundance, location, and form of water on the moon. These findings will guide future robotic and human explorations, including the Artemis program's human landings. The presence of water on the moon holds great potential for various purposes such as drinking water purification, fuel production, and providing breathable oxygen.\n\nThe LTM will utilize four infrared channels to create temperature maps of the lunar surface, ranging from approximately -163 °C to 127 °C. Additionally, it will use eleven narrow infrared channels to identify variations in the composition of the moon's rocks and soils. This will provide valuable information about the lunar surface and potential water sources.\n\nMeanwhile, the HVM3, developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, will detect and map the form, abundance, and locations of water on the lunar landscape by analyzing spectral fingerprints. By observing the same areas at different times of the day, the Lunar Trailblazer will be able to monitor changes in the amount of water, such as its transformation into gas as the surface heats up or its accumulation as frost in shaded regions during cooling periods.\n\nThe Lunar Trailblazer mission aims to answer important questions such as whether water molecules are trapped inside lunar rocks or if significant amounts of water ice exist in the permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles.\n\nSelected by NASA's Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEX) program in 2019, the Lunar Trailblazer will launch as a secondary payload on a planned lunar lander mission led by Intuitive Machines. This cost-effective approach allows the Lunar Trailblazer to be deployed alongside a larger spacecraft, maximizing efficiency.\n\nProfessor Neil Bowles, the instrument scientist for LTM at the University of Oxford's Department of Physics, expressed his excitement about the project. He stated that designing, building, testing, and delivering the LTM amidst the challenges of the recent pandemic is a testament to the innovative and dedicated teams at Oxford and across the UK. The mission's data will enhance our understanding of water transportation on the lunar surface and its potential capture in cold traps near the lunar poles, paving the way for future human and robotic explorations.\n\nFor the Planetary Experiments Group at the University of Oxford's Department of Physics, the development of the LTM marks another achievement in their 50-year history of creating components for spaceflight and infrared thermal mapping cameras. They have contributed to missions to Mars, Saturn, and the moon. In 2014, the department successfully built and launched a small infrared thermal camera as part of the UK spacecraft TechDemoSat-1, which aimed to test technologies for creating thermal maps of asteroids. Leveraging this prior experience, the Oxford team was well-prepared to propose an updated thermal camera for the Lunar Trailblazer mission. END"}

Organizational structures, including universities, will need to be reimagined. It's not just writers who may need to explore new career paths, but professionals in various fields, such as software engineering and law, and even lecturers. AI can not only process data faster but also reason and be creative. It can even forge emotional connections, as seen with AI chatbots and the millions of men in China who have an AI girlfriend named \"Xiaoice,\" mirroring the film \"Her.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for business schools like Oxford Saïd and its students? Professor Dutta believes that they will be at the forefront of a new world, where roles for staff and managers may become obsolete and machines will assume business thinking. While this prospect may be unsettling for some, Professor Dutta eagerly ponders the implications, always seeking innovative solutions and perspectives. As the dean of Oxford Saïd, he leads the business school, authors books, and serves as an entrepreneur and advisor to influential organizations like the White House and Davos. He is also deeply committed to non-profit work.\n\nProfessor Dutta's multicultural background and extensive travels contribute to his broad perspective. Born in India, he completed his doctorate at Berkeley, where he met his wife, Lourdes Casanova, a fellow academic. Currently, she teaches at Cornell University's College of Business. Their daughter, Sara Dutta, studied at Oxford and now resides on the western coast of the United States.\n\nIn summary, while AI brings uncertainty, Professor Dutta encourages business schools and universities to embrace the potential it offers.

Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of the official secrets act, much of this history has been left untold and unrecognized. However, a fascinating biography has shed light on the potential significance of John Langshaw Austin's role in military intelligence during the war, suggesting that it may have surpassed his contributions to philosophy in the long run. This revelation challenges our understanding of him, especially considering that there is far more written about Austin as a philosopher compared to his time in WW2 intelligence.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the situation. In nearly 400 pages, Rowe takes us through what has traditionally been considered the starting point of Austin's \"main\" career – his rise as a plain language philosopher in post-war Oxford. Sadly, his life was cut short by lung cancer in 1960, and he didn't publish much. Nevertheless, Austin's impact on Oxford philosophy was partly due to his intimidating demeanor, which has since faded away. Yet, beyond his academic pursuits, Austin held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army and received numerous honors for his intelligence work, including the OBE, the French Croix de Guerre, and the U.S. Officer of the Legion of Merit.\n\nThis biography uncovers not only Austin's involvement in D-Day intelligence, for which he had already received commendation, but also his crucial role in deciphering Germany's plans in North Africa during a delicate and uncertain period of the war. Additionally, Austin played a major part in the intelligence operations during Hitler's Ardennes counter-offensive in the winter of 1944-1945. Known for his brilliant mind and strong work ethic, Austin was more celebrated among his colleagues for his intellectual prowess than his partying skills. However, it's worth mentioning that he narrowly escaped death while marveling at a nighttime London blitz from a rooftop – a popular activity among the affluent or adventurous.\n\nAside from his wartime contributions, Austin's connection to Oxford looms large. He attended Balliol College in 1929, and before the war, he was a don at Magdalen College. After the war, he became the White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Corpus Christi College, holding this position from 1952 onwards. Without delving into the philosophy itself, it's interesting to note how Austin managed to present contrasting personas to different audiences. He was kind and generous in private or when supervising students, but formidable and imposing in public or on the battlefield. It's no wonder that words like acid, acerbic, astringent, arrogant, and especially austere come to mind when describing him. The fear of misusing language was so pervasive among his peers that it stifled debate, philosophy, and perhaps even the university itself. Papers became focused on trivial linguistic matters and lacked ambition, brevity, and readability.\n\nThis critical atmosphere persisted for years, with other scholars feeling compelled to couch their questions in convoluted language filled with caveats. Unfortunately, this excessive caution extended beyond philosophy and affected various aspects of college management well into the late 20th century. It's a shame that such restraint prevailed. On a lighter note, Austin had a penchant for a bottled, non-alcoholic apple drink that he would often bring home for his children, amusingly named Cidrax! This was during the time when he and his wife Jean, an alumna of Somerville College, resided in a large house in Old Marston. Jean outlived John by over fifty years, and only after her passing in 2016 did an abundance of evidence for this study emerge from cardboard boxes filled with letters and documents. Now, just seven years later, we finally have this remarkable book to piece together the story. END"}

The company has also set its sights on global growth, as it expands and scales up its operations.\n\nColin McManus, the principal engineer at Oxa and a member of LMH from 2011, has been with the company since its inception. His LinkedIn profile clearly states that Oxa is actively hiring, and their website shows over 15 open positions. This growth is quite remarkable, especially considering that many recent news stories about self-driving cars have focused on layoffs and closures.\n\nTo understand why Oxa is so exceptional and unique, we need to dig deeper. However, first, let's highlight the exciting news that Oxa, formerly Oxbotica, has become the talk of the UK innovation community in 2023. They recently secured an impressive $140 million in a Series C funding round, despite the challenging investor landscape for deep tech companies. This funding boost is particularly noteworthy because Oxa currently has 350 employees, mainly based in Oxford but with additional teams in Toronto, Canada, and Colorado, US.\n\nIt's no wonder that Oxa's founder, Professor Paul Newman, who graduated from Balliol in 1991, was awarded the Commander of the British Empire (CBE) for his contributions to engineering and technology in the 2023 King's Birthday Honours. He not only serves as the Chief Technology Officer for the company but also recently took on the role of President, while the position of CEO is held by Gavin Jackson. This funding success is a testament to Paul's original vision when he co-founded the company with Ingmar Posner, a professor of engineering science at Oxford specializing in applied artificial intelligence, in 2014.\n\nPaul's vision has always been grounded in reality while still being forward-thinking, which is not an easy balance to achieve in an industry known for hype. After working in Sydney and Boston, Paul returned to Oxford as a young academic, feeling inspired and surrounded by greatness. Oxford felt like a place where he could make groundbreaking ideas a reality.\n\nOne of Oxa's early investors, Kiko Ventures, a cleantech venture capitalist company, recognized the enormous potential of autonomous vehicle software, but in different applications than most investors anticipated. They believed that autonomy would first be deployed in areas such as goods delivery, safety-critical industrial environments, and multi-occupancy on-demand urban shuttles. This aligns with Oxa's realistic approach to what is possible and when in the field of self-driving cars.\n\nBryn Balcombe, who has been responsible for autonomy systems and regulations at Oxa since February 2022, expresses his admiration for Oxa's practical stance on what can be achieved in this realm.

With support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the project will address the key challenges currently hindering the tidal energy sector from reaching its full potential.\n\nProfessor Richard Willden, the project lead from the University of Oxford, expressed excitement about the opportunity to harness the powerful tides surrounding the UK. He believes that innovative engineering can contribute to greater energy security and help achieve the country's net-zero goals by 2050. The EPSRC investment in Cotide allows for the collaboration of world-class engineering expertise, ensuring the UK remains a leader in tidal stream development and deployment.\n\nTo meet the UK's target of reaching net-zero by 2050, we need to decarbonize our energy supplies and significantly expand renewable energy generation from the current 50GW to 120-300GW. Currently, the powerful tides around the UK are not fully utilized for their energy potential, with the main site being Pentland Firth in Scotland, known as Meygen. Unlike wind and solar power, tides flow predictably at specific times each day, making them a reliable and renewable energy source that can contribute to more resilient energy networks.\n\nCotide will focus on developing state-of-the-art tidal stream turbine systems. Unlike traditional tidal barrages and lagoons that require turbines to be installed in structures like dams or sea walls, tidal stream turbines are fixed directly at sea where the tidal flows are strongest and most suitable. This makes them more cost-effective, easier to install, and reduces their environmental impact.\n\nIf fully developed across the UK, tidal stream systems have the potential to generate over 6GW, enough to power over 5 million homes. The export market for this technology could be worth £25bn, supporting over 25,000 marine energy jobs. However, technical challenges remain, including the need for careful design to ensure reliability in harsh marine environments characterized by corrosive seawater and turbulent waves.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, Cotide will bring together three multidisciplinary teams with expertise in device hydrodynamics, rotor materials, corrosion, risk and reliability, environmental modeling, and system control and optimization. By integrating these elements into holistic design processes, the project aims to significantly reduce costs, improve engineering solutions, and remove unnecessary redundancy.\n\nProfessor Willden explained that through a unified co-design approach, Cotide will develop a framework to assess the impact of design decisions and contribute to a better understanding of achieving through-life reliability. Additionally, the project will explore the potential of digitalization for optimal performance.\n\nCotide will build upon the unique capabilities of the Oxford team and the university's recent investment in a state-of-the-art current and wave flume, which will facilitate rapid testing of turbine and platform designs. The researchers will collaborate with over twenty industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies, including EDF Energy plc, the Health and Safety Executive, the Marine Energy Council, and global manufacturer Arkema International. This collaboration ensures that Cotide's outputs will deliver new tools, models, and processes with direct industrial impact.\n\nChair of the Marine Energy Council, Sue Barr, emphasized the need for real advancements in system performance, reliability metrics, and scalability in order for tidal stream energy to become more competitive. She believes that the collaborative and innovative scope of the Cotide project presents a real opportunity for successful outcomes. END"}

He likes to joke that he shares the same status as Karl Pearson, the renowned father of statistics, as both were ranked third in their respective years at Cambridge University. Before finding his true calling, Stephen worked in banking after pursuing a career in statistics. However, it was in 2006 when he joined Harvard University that he truly found his stride. Not only did he lead the Harvard Management Company, but he also had the opportunity to teach statistics to undergraduates. Stephen thoroughly enjoyed this experience as it allowed him to witness firsthand the transformative power of great universities in the lives of their students.\n\nKnown for his engaging teaching style, Stephen was recognized with awards for his outstanding teaching. He had a knack for breaking up long lectures with fun and random facts, which he had picked up during his own undergraduate years in the UK. His students could suddenly find themselves learning about Bayes' theorem, exploring the history of Cadbury's chocolate, or delving into Salman Rushdie's early career.\n\nStephen is deeply committed to promoting inclusion and providing financial support to talented students from low-income backgrounds. He firmly believes in leveling the playing field and ensuring that all students, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to attend top universities. In this regard, the LMH Foundation Year greatly appealed to Stephen when he applied for the principalship at LMH. He is eager to find ways to eliminate the financial barriers that prevent deserving students from pursuing their educational goals.\n\nStephen's firm belief in the value of education and its ability to create lasting change aligns with the American philanthropic culture. He would love to see a similar mindset adopted in the UK, where many individuals, including himself and the author of this feature, benefited from full student grants for teaching and maintenance, a concept that has since disappeared. According to Stephen, the introduction of student fees in the UK has limited access to higher education for students from low-income and middle-income families. Although statistical evidence to support this claim is still emerging, Stephen firmly believes that anecdotal evidence points to a significant hurdle.\n\nMany young students now find themselves choosing paid work immediately after school instead of incurring student debt. Others struggle through college, juggling part-time jobs to minimize their debt. This financial burden greatly impacts their ability to fully engage in their studies and enjoy the benefits of their college years.\n\nStephen also questions the structure of student debt which, in the UK, operates as a graduate tax that is written off after forty years. He suggests that it might be more beneficial to structure student debt as a grant, similar to the system at Harvard. At Harvard, talented students from low-income backgrounds pay nothing, while those from wealthier families do pay their way. This straightforward approach eliminates any ambiguity. Stephen wonders if LMH could build on its existing foundation year, created by his predecessor Alan Rusbridger in 2016, to ensure that any deserving applicant who cannot afford tuition fees is fully funded by the college.\n\nOne of the aspects Stephen loves about LMH is its diverse and inclusive community. As a pioneer women's college, LMH has always embraced progressiveness and open-mindedness. Additionally, Stephen praises the supportive environment at LMH, describing it as a wonderful \"bubble\" where students can flourish.\n\nHowever, one challenge LMH faces is its smaller endowment compared to wealthier colleges within the university. This limits its ability to subsidize student rents as much as it would like. Stephen hopes to see the endowment grow so that LMH can make an even greater impact within the collegiate university and provide more financial support to its students. END"}

At 98 years old, Elizabeth is LMH's last known Bletchley Park alumna, according to the college. For a long time, Oxford's contribution to the war effort remained a mystery due to the Official Secrets Act. In a chapter about the war in the university's official history, Paul Addison dismisses the recruitment of academics as \"cloak-and-dagger warfare,\" implying that intellectuals were a small part of secret intelligence. He only mentions five names, all men. However, LMH is now aware of 33 women who were recruited, with former college principal Lynda Grier tasked with finding suitable candidates. Elizabeth Kaser was one of them, studying English at LMH for a year before being selected for a role that relied on her linguistic skills, involving recording and intercepting transmissions. Women were often recruited for their proficiency in modern languages, working alongside codebreakers and cryptographers at Bletchley Park, which was purchased in 1938 as a government code and cypher school. \n\nDuring her visit to LMH, Elizabeth had the opportunity to meet with the current college principal, Professor Stephen Blyth, engaging in a lively conversation about her experiences. Elizabeth fondly recalled the vibrant atmosphere at Oxford, with many important figures seeking refuge in Oxford or Cambridge from London during the war. As a former student of a convent school in Manchester, Elizabeth was the first from her school to attend Oxford and only the second to attend university. She was a trailblazer, explaining in an oral history interview that she didn't intend to break rules, but rather make her own decisions. Elizabeth joined LMH at a time when it was still uncommon for women to pursue higher education. Just one year into her studies, she went to work at the Mathematics Institute, decoding war communications for Bletchley Park. Looking back, she described that time as exhilarating, full of urgency and intellectual stimulation. The onset of World War II opened up new opportunities for women. After signing the Official Secrets Act, Elizabeth worked clandestinely for the Secret Service, listening to and recording classified conversations. Following the war, she worked for the World Health Organization in Geneva before eventually returning to Oxford with her young family.\n\nAmong other Oxford women who served their country secretly, Patricia Brown (Bartley, 1936) was one of the most successful. By January 1942, at a relatively young age, Patricia was leading the prestigious German diplomatic section, overseeing older men. In October of the same year, there was a significant breakthrough in deciphering the twice-encoded German diplomatic code humorously referred to as \"Floradora,\" after a musical. There is a list of LMH alumnae known to have served during WWII, but information is less clear for other women's colleges like St. Hugh's, St. Hilda's, Somerville, and St. Anne's. It is certain that other Oxford alumnae also served, including Janet Ferrier (St. Hilda's, 1937). However, the role of Principal Lynda Grier appears to have made Oxford's first women's college prominent in recruiting women for intelligence services during World War II. Another renowned British codebreaker was Betty Webb, who recently celebrated her 100th birthday on May 13, 2023, and published her account of codebreaking at Bletchley Park titled \"No More Secrets: My Part in Codebreaking at Bletchley Park.\" Reflecting the sentiments of many of her peers, including those at Oxford, she said, \"I wanted to contribute more to the war effort than baking sausage rolls.\" END"}

The findings indicate that the environmental impact of vegans is approximately one-third of that of high meat eaters. Additionally, there was a 30% difference in environmental harm between high-meat and low-meat diets across various measures such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, water pollution risk, and biodiversity loss. The participants in the study identified themselves as vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, or meat eaters, and the environmental impact of their diets was assessed accordingly.\n\nThe research team considered the variation in environmental impact based on the production methods and sources of the food, ensuring that the results were comprehensive and not limited to specific food production techniques. The relationship between animal-based food consumption and environmental impact remained clear, despite variations in how and where the food was produced. The authors of the study argue that this finding should serve as a call to action for policies aimed at reducing meat production and consumption. The paper detailing these findings has been published in Nature Food.\n\nThe impact of our food choices on the environment is well-established. In 2015, the global food system accounted for about one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions, both directly and indirectly. Moreover, it is estimated that the food system is responsible for 70% of the world's freshwater use and 78% of freshwater pollution. Human activities, primarily related to agriculture, have affected approximately three-quarters of the planet's ice-free land, leading to significant biodiversity loss through activities like deforestation.\n\nLead author Professor Peter Scarborough from the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at Oxford University emphasizes that our dietary choices have a significant impact on the planet. Focusing on isolated data that highlights either the high environmental impact of certain plant-based foods or the low impact of certain meats can obscure the overall relationship between animal-based foods and the environment. This study, which incorporates data from over 38,000 farms in more than 100 countries, demonstrates that high meat diets have the most significant impact on key environmental indicators such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Reducing meat and dairy consumption can have a substantial positive effect on your dietary footprint.\n\nPrevious research has already indicated that plant-based diets have lower environmental impacts than meat-based diets in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water use. It has also suggested that reducing meat intake tends to be healthier. However, these studies often make assumptions about people's food choices and do not account for variations in environmental impact depending on the source and production methods of food. Professor Scarborough and his team looked at actual eating habits, using data from a sample of 55,000 individuals in the UK who completed a food frequency questionnaire. They then connected this data to databases that estimate the environmental impacts of commonly consumed foods, considering the variations in sourcing and production methods.\n\nThe findings revealed that all five environmental impacts studied were associated with the consumption of animal-based foods. The environmental impacts of vegans were only one-quarter of those of high meat eaters in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and land use, 27% for water pollution, 46% for water use, and 34% for biodiversity. Most indicators showed at least a 30% difference between low and high meat eaters. This study reinforces previous findings, highlighting that vegan and vegetarian diets have significantly lower environmental impacts compared to fish and meat consumption.

Since its establishment in 1823, it has provided a platform for Oxford students to freely engage in conversations about religion, politics, and a wide range of other important topics. Our members have passionately debated international relations, theology, genetics, nuclear policy, civil rights, and the environment, sparking intense discussions worldwide. However, it is important to clarify that we have never sought controversy for the sake of it. In recent years, we have found ourselves in the spotlight simply for hosting speakers who hold differing views, which has caused discomfort for some individuals.\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan once described the Oxford Union as the \"last bastion of free speech.\" This statement is more relevant and crucial than ever before. Unfortunately, many moderate thinkers now avoid discussing certain issues, fearing backlash from a small but vocal minority. It is disheartening to witness the chilling effects of self-imposed censorship in universities, social media, and the arts. If we do not encourage students to ask difficult questions, how will we address the most pressing challenges of tomorrow, both within our communities and globally?\n\nDefending free speech has become increasingly vital, as evidenced by the growing wave of self-censorship on campuses, social media platforms, and the arts. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes freedom of opinion and expression as a fundamental principle. Consequently, championing this principle has become the greatest challenge facing student leaders. It is disheartening to receive insults, accusations, and even physical threats from those who disagree with our efforts. As a result, many students across the UK are afraid to stand up for free speech, fearing humiliation, bullying, and harassment.\n\nIt is important for those who accused us of \"de-platforming\" speakers to consider the profiles of our guest speakers and the challenging security environments under which they often speak. They should also acknowledge the resilience required for a student-led organization to invite controversial speakers. As we celebrate our bicentenary, we reflect on the significant debates that have resonated worldwide, the guest speakers who have faced rigorous questioning from our members, and the contributions of our alumni life members who have shaped our heritage and history.\n\nThis year, we marked 60 years since women were granted equal membership rights, thanks to the tireless efforts of individuals from all genders. We also celebrated the 90th anniversary of our most famous debate, \"This House would not fight for king and country,\" noted by Mussolini and believed to have influenced Hitler's perception of the British. Most notably, in late February, we hosted our bicentenary debate, welcoming back hundreds of alumni life members to celebrate 200 years of free speech at the Oxford Union.\n\nDespite the festivities, our commitment to free speech remains stronger than ever. We echo the university's affirmation that free speech is the lifeblood of a university – it enables the pursuit of knowledge and helps us approach truth. END"}

Many people across the world have expressed surprise since February 24, 2022, at Ukraine's strong determination to repel the invasion. However, it wouldn't be a shock if Austria defended itself against an invasion by Germany, or if Canadians volunteered to fight back while US bombs rained down on Toronto.\n\nThe questions that have dominated public discussions about Ukraine over the past year all come down to the fact that Ukraine was not seen as a 'proper' country by either the East or the West. The only difference now, one year since the invasion, is that most countries - except for Russia - recognize Ukraine as a sovereign nation. Even with more Russian troops on Ukrainian soil, the Russian president still views Ukraine as part of a greater Russia and Ukrainians as Russians, even though they are not. This ongoing attack and seizure of territory in Ukraine perpetuates a Russian narrative of its right to a sphere of influence or, to put it bluntly, an empire. Dominating its neighbors is a throwback to Soviet times, an aspiration for imperial power, and should be seen as such.\n\nIt is evident that Putin does not recognize Ukraine's sovereignty or international law in general, which does not bode well for any peace process. However, it is important to understand that this thinking about Ukraine is deeply ingrained in both the East and the West, even if not explicitly expressed. For many countries, even Ukraine's friendly neighbors, the state's name is preceded by a definite article. It is referred to as \"Ukraine,\" implying that it is merely a borderland. \n\nThe international community has been amazed by the patriotism and determination of Ukrainians, who only gained independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, in the years leading up to and since the USSR's collapse, Ukraine has developed a strong civil society and a sense of national identity, as have other former Soviet republics. This is not to say that nation-building hasn't faced challenges since 1991, as is also true for other former Soviet republics, including Russia.\n\nThe collapse of the USSR was a tremendous loss for Russia, and Putin himself referred to it as the worst thing to happen in the 20th century. This sentiment is reflected in the change that occurred to Russia's national anthem. The Soviet-era anthem was replaced in 1991 with a new Russian piece of music, which was not well-received by Russians. When Putin assumed power less than a decade later, he revived the Soviet anthem, bringing back Russia's sense of itself as a powerful nation in relation to its neighbors.\n\nTherefore, even though Ukraine has been a sovereign state since 1991, the war it has been fighting for the past 12 months (and eight years) can be seen as a war of independence. Not in the traditional sense of gaining recognition as a state, as that is already established by the international community, but as a demonstration of Ukraine's autonomy, agency, and ability to shape its own future. A future where Ukraine is always acknowledged as the sovereign nation it truly is. END"}

However, to understand how it all began, we need to go back five more years to a Led Zeppelin concert in the O2 Arena in December 2007. Led Zeppelin, a band nurtured by the legendary Turkish-born founder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, held this incredibly successful concert as a tribute to him after his sudden passing at the end of 2006. As a generous gesture, Led Zeppelin made a substantial donation from the profits to establish the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund. This fund was managed by Mica Ertegun, Ahmet's Romanian-born widow, who is a successful interior designer in New York. The aim was to provide scholarships for Turkish students to study at Oxford.\n\nThrough this initiative, a connection was formed between Mica Ertegun, the university, and the then Vice-Chancellor, John Hood. Over the next five years, Mica founded the Ertegun Programme, which not only provided scholarships in the humanities (a cause she and her late husband passionately supported) but also expanded to offer up to twenty scholarships at a time. The creation of twenty graduate scholarships for humanities students, who often face financial struggles, is a reason for significant celebration. However, the Ertegun Programme goes beyond just financial support. Mica Ertegun's vision was to build a community of learning. To realize this vision, she funded the refurbishment of an elegant Georgian house on St Giles' Street, now fittingly called \"Ertegun House.\"\n\nWithin Ertegun House, scholars are provided with everything they could possibly need as graduate students. They have access to a spacious desk in the heart of Oxford within a beautifully designed building that is open 24\/7 every day of the year. There is also a large and versatile seminar room where they can organize and host academic events, a kitchen-common room for informal interactions, and an elegant courtyard and garden. Moreover, on the ground floor, there are two staff members whose doors are always open to provide support in any way they can. One is a senior academic from the university who serves as the \"senior scholar in residence\" for several years, and the other is a full-time administrator who ensures the smooth functioning of the institution and assists with any issues that may arise. Additionally, there is a budget for events, such as group visits to exhibitions or funding for one-day workshops focused on a scholar's specific area of expertise.\n\nNow, ten years later, it is evident that the programme has been a resounding success. I am well-positioned to make this judgment as I was the first \"senior scholar\" at Ertegun House, serving in that role for four years, and have since maintained close involvement with the programme. I can confidently affirm that it has achieved remarkable results. The numbers speak for themselves, with the programme supporting or continuing to support 141 scholars from all continents, pursuing a wide range of humanities degrees from MST to DPhil. Furthermore, Ertegun House truly functions as a community in various ways, offering scholars invaluable peer-support and encouragement in their research, which can often be a solitary endeavor. It breaks down the barriers of hyper-specialization prevalent in modern academia and fosters ambition and interdisciplinary thinking.\n\nA highlight of every week is the Wednesday lunchtime seminar, where all scholars gather to present their research to their colleagues and engage in insightful discussions and Q&A sessions. During my time as the senior scholar at Ertegun House, I found it fascinating and immensely rewarding to interact with brilliant minds from all over the world in an environment perfectly suited to nurture research and foster intellectual debate. I personally benefitted greatly from my four years at Ertegun House, with my intellect continuously challenged and tested, while always surrounded by a positive atmosphere. I can confidently state that the same is true for all who pass through the programme. END"}

These images show the real decline in ecosystems worldwide, from coral reefs to forests in Australia and the Amazon, from peatlands to the Arctic tundra. There is immense pressure on the natural world at this time, but it is also crucial for our climate and our future.\n\nThe threats to climate and biodiversity are not separate issues to be tackled independently. They are interconnected. Today, two briefings were published—one by the Royal Society and the other by the Interacademy Partnership, which represents science, engineering, and medical academies from around the world. These briefings, prepared by leading scientists and approved by national academies, represent the collective viewpoint of the UK and the world's science academies. I had the privilege of overseeing this process both at the UK and international level.\n\nThese briefings emphasize that biodiversity must be at the core of discussions about climate change. They cannot be separated. The timing of these briefings is not a coincidence. This week, biodiversity is the focus of a major UN conference, COP15. In less than a month, it will also be a key theme at COP26 in Glasgow, where world leaders and policymakers from across the globe will gather to discuss climate change. Nature will have a prominent place at the table. However, we argue that it shouldn't just be present; it should be the foundation for decision-making.\n\nOur report, published by the Royal Society, urges world leaders to prioritize integrated climate and biodiversity policies. Only through this approach can we protect biodiversity while simultaneously contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In our briefing, we delve into how climate change impacts biodiversity and ecosystems. It creates a vicious cycle—rising temperatures lead to fires, droughts, and floods, which in turn lead to further degradation of ecosystems and contribute to more climate change.\n\nDespite all the alarming news, there is reason for optimism. We can take action to support both climate change mitigation and the natural world while promoting biodiversity. By integrating climate and biodiversity policies, we can unlock the full potential of biodiversity in supporting climate action. Nature-based solutions are available now, but they require significant investment to be implemented on the necessary scale. There are immediate actions we can take, such as restoring peatlands, improving forests, promoting sustainable farming practices, reducing meat and dairy consumption, and increasing protected land and sea areas.\n\nHowever, we must also be cautious of potential hazards. Some interventions aimed at mitigating climate change, like planting trees in natural grasslands or expanding bioenergy, can further strain our lands and harm biodiversity. Moreover, nature-based solutions must be accompanied by substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and not be used as an excuse to delay action on emissions. We must also prioritize cooperation and engagement with local communities to ensure fair outcomes.\n\nIn the coming months, we have a unique opportunity to address the climate change and biodiversity crises in a bold and interconnected way. Let's seize this chance to create a better future for our planet and all its inhabitants. END"}

COVID-19 has undoubtedly made things worse, but we must not lose sight of the bigger picture and how our actions today will impact us in the future.\n\nOne way to connect the dots and understand the scale of these problems is by looking at something as simple as a mango. In Pakistan, the mango is not just a fruit, it's a symbol of the vibrant summers and a staple in their culture. With countless varieties, the mango brightens up markets and delights people's taste buds. However, COVID-19 poses a threat to the mango and other fruits and vegetables. Due to travel restrictions and other complications, the harvest and shipment of mangoes may be severely impacted this year. This not only affects the livelihoods of farmers but also contributes to a larger food insecurity issue in Pakistan and beyond.\n\nIt's essential to realize that the current crisis is not an isolated event. Climate change has already been affecting fruit crops through extreme weather events, changing temperatures, and pests. These challenges have a devastating impact on ordinary citizens, with many households facing food security stress and a significant number of children experiencing stunted growth.\n\nWhy should people outside the region care about these issues? The answer lies in the potential for change and the interconnectedness of our world. Pakistan, led by Prime Minister Imran Khan, has taken an innovative approach to addressing the costs of the crisis. The 10 billion tree tsunami project, initiated in 2014, not only aims to tackle climate change but also provides employment opportunities for the unemployed during this difficult time. Furthermore, the Ehsaas poverty alleviation program has been instrumental in providing emergency cash assistance to millions of families affected by the lockdown.\n\nTo ensure long-term solutions, we need to continue developing institutional and policy support for these programs, creating social and financial safety nets for the most vulnerable members of our society. This requires removing barriers to financial inclusion and embracing technological advancements in banking services.\n\nAmidst the challenges we face, there is room for hope and innovation. It's easy to envision a bleak future, but let's make space for imagination and consider the possibilities that lie ahead. Just like biting into a delicious, juicy mango brings joy and happiness, we must remember that humans are resilient. We will overcome this crisis and create a new normal, but it's crucial that we do not leave a large portion of the population behind in the process. END"}

Additionally, traffic congestion is a major issue in many cities.\n\nRecently, the Oxford EV Summit was hosted by the Said Business School for the second year in a row. EV stands for electric vehicle. Last year, the focus was on replacing regular cars with electric ones. This year, the discussion expanded into unexpected areas, bringing more nuance and caution to the conversation.\n\nA common theme at conferences like this is the challenges electric vehicles face in terms of cost, performance, and infrastructure. Despite these barriers, the development of electric vehicles is progressing rapidly, so don't lose hope! For example, the new electric Mini, set to be manufactured in Oxford's industrial suburb, will be available from the autumn. Although it is £8,000 more expensive than the petrol model and has a shorter range, it is a step in the right direction.\n\nDuring the summit, Paul McNamara, the technical director for Williams Advanced Engineering, shared an interesting historical perspective. He pointed out that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, electric cars could have been more successful if they had been slightly improved. Unfortunately, the development of internal combustion engines prevailed, leading to the dominance of petrol-powered cars. Looking back, it seems that this choice was not the most efficient or environmentally friendly one.\n\nThe internal combustion engine, which has been successful for over a century, now appears to be an outdated and inefficient solution in terms of propulsive efficiency. Electric motors, on the other hand, are about 85% efficient, meaning that 85% of the energy they consume is converted into forward motion. In contrast, internal combustion engines only have an efficiency of 25-30%, wasting energy as heat and unburned fuel, which contributes to harmful emissions and health issues.\n\nThe success of the car industry has ironically led to its downfall. In the past, pollution and inefficiency were not significant concerns due to the smaller number of vehicles on the road. However, with the exponential increase in car ownership, pollution and congestion have become major problems, especially in areas like Oxford. Globally, there are already over 1 billion vehicles, and this number is projected to triple to 3 billion by 2050. Most of these vehicles will still rely on internal combustion engines, which is discouraging for those advocating for climate action, air quality improvement, and electric vehicles.\n\nOn a positive note, some countries are making progress in decarbonizing their energy grids, which makes electrification an increasingly attractive solution. The main challenge for electric cars lies in energy storage, as liquid fuel tanks in conventional cars provide high energy density compared to heavy and bulky batteries.\n\nOverall, while there are still obstacles to overcome, the move towards electric transportation is gaining momentum. By addressing the issues of cost, performance, and infrastructure, and finding innovative solutions for energy storage, we can work towards a cleaner and more sustainable future for transportation.

I experienced violent headaches, a burning face, dizziness, brain fog, palpitations, and extreme exhaustion. This all happened in September 2008, around the same time that Wi-Fi and cordless landline phones were installed in the building where I worked at Paris University. Curious about my symptoms, I did some research online and discovered that many others were experiencing similar issues. Interestingly, when I was in an environment with little wireless connectivity, my symptoms would disappear. \n\nNow, with the introduction of smart meters and the upcoming advancements in technology like 5G and the Internet of Things, the public will be exposed to even more radio-frequency radiation (RFR) from wireless devices. Scientists from all over the world are expressing growing concern about the health and environmental impacts of RFR exposure. In fact, in 2015, over 200 specialists in the effects of electromagnetic fields on biological systems signed an appeal to the United Nations and the World Health Organization, urging for more protective exposure limits and advising the public to reduce their exposure to RFR.\n\nThe current belief in public health is that RFR at non-thermal levels, meaning it doesn't cause tissue heating, is safe. However, the appeal to the UN disagreed, pointing out that studies have shown various negative effects at levels below current guidelines, including an increased risk of cancer, cellular stress, harmful free radicals, genetic damage, reproductive system changes, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and a decline in overall well-being. \n\nOne of the most widespread impacts of RFR may be its effect on sleep. There has been a sharp increase in articles about sleeplessness, and while there are many factors contributing to this issue, several studies have linked RFR exposure to a disruption in the production of melatonin, the hormone essential for restorative sleep and a powerful antioxidant. The combination of blue light from screens and ambient RFR may be contributing to the sleeplessness epidemic we are currently facing.\n\nThe mounting evidence of the biological effects of non-thermal RFR exposure has motivated me and many others worldwide to raise awareness about the potential long-term health risks of wireless radiation, especially for children and young people. An investigative article titled \"How Big Wireless Made Us Think Cell Phones Are Safe: A Special Investigation\" was published by The Nation in March 2018, shedding light on corporate interference in RFR science and the hidden radiation increase behind the 5G rollout. After reading this article, it's hard to remain unconcerned.\n\nIt is worth noting that since 2005, the UK chief medical officers have advised that children and young people under 16 should only use mobile phones for essential purposes and keep calls short. Unfortunately, this advice has been poorly disseminated, and many parents are unaware of it. As a result, many children now routinely use smartphones, exposing themselves to RFR all day at school through Wi-Fi. Government data shows that half of UK children between the ages of 9 and 16 use a smartphone every day.\n\nOur economy is becoming increasingly reliant on RFR, but if we continue to follow the belief that it is harmless unless it heats up body tissue, it may not be sustainable in the long run. Therefore, we should exercise more caution in our current use of wireless technology and explore the development of alternative technologies that are compatible with our biology and future-proof. Just like we are striving for a low-carbon economy, we should also aim for a sustainable, low-RFR economy. The University of Oxford, or its innovative alumni, could take the lead in developing safe, bio-friendly technologies for the future. As someone who attended Oxford, I would be proud to see my alma mater rise to this challenge. END"}
{"prompt":"what did the romans ever do for us ? it seems they added an inch to the average height of their british subjects — they came , they saw , we prospered . and after taking a plunge during the anglo-saxon era , the height of the average inhabitant rose again in the wake of the norman conquest . these are just two of the findings of new research using data from skeletal remains to calculate how the average height of men rose or fell over 2 , 000 years of history in what is now england . the result is a startling picture of changes in health and wellbeing . using data of skeletal remains of men aged between 21 and 49 years from a range of archaeological excavations across england , they deduced individuals’ full heights from their femur length . lead author dr gregori galofré-vilà ( pictured right ) , from the department of sociology at the university of oxford , said ‘we believe our results shed new light on the development of health in england over the very long run . ’ he and his team worked on the basis that height , linked with childhood nutrition , is a good measure of wellbeing and can be estimated accurately from the length of a full grown man’s femur . biologists and epidemiologists have long recognised that although the main causes of variation in individual height may be genetic , changes in the economic , social and environmental circumstances are reflected in the mean heights of different groups of people at any given time . the working paper ( which can be read in full here ) reveals that men in this area of britain became taller when it was under roman occupation ( 200–410ad ) , with average height rising from 167cm ( 5ft 6in ) to 170cm ( 5ft 7in ) . the researchers suggest this rise in average height coincided with the romans’ improved water supply and sanitation systems and a more varied diet . heights did not decline immediately after the romans left britain in 410 , but fell from 600ad . the paper highlights previous research suggesting that health may have deteriorated when populations moved out of the towns and cities set up by the romans , abandoning the more hygienic water supplies and waste-disposal systems . plague and pestilence then became common and infectious diseases were on the increase , with archaeological evidence also suggesting that diets were inadequate , notes the paper . in the wake of the black death of 1348–1350 , however , average heights increased again the paper notes that this coincided with a boost in agricultural production . from 1400 to the early 1650 , mean height reached 173–174cm ( 5ft 8½in ) . ‘our data shows that average heights in england in the medieval era and between 1400 and 1700 were similar to those of the 20th century , ’ said dr galofré-vilà . the early years of the 1600s were ‘unusually healthy’ , and the paper notes that the introduction of poor laws may have contributed to better health for poorer sections of society . heights fell after 1650 , reaching just 169cm ( 5ft 6½in ) in the late 1600s — a decline that continued until the early 1800s . the study compares the average heights of englishmen with similar work previously carried out by richard steckel of ohio state university , who created a european health index . although the european and the english sets of evidence provide a consistent history , the oxford-led study shows that the english may have escaped the worst of a little ice age , when the medieval warm period was succeeded by a period of cooling with the health effects more marked across continental europe . and what about the future ? galofré-vilà said ‘since the early 19th century , average heights for englishmen have increased substantially , reaching 175cm in 1950 and 177cm [5ft 10in] in 1970 — among the tallest of any population worldwide . if mean heights are a good measure of well-being , it seems we are now in previously uncharted territory . within the last 100 years , the average heights of englishmen have risen more than at any time in recorded history . ’ ->","completion":" Have you ever wondered about the impact of the Romans on British society? Well, it turns out they actually had quite a positive influence! Recent research using skeletal remains has shown that the average height of their British subjects increased by an inch during Roman occupation. After a decline during the Anglo-Saxon era, the average height of inhabitants rose again following the Norman Conquest. These findings provide a fascinating insight into the changes in health and well-being over the course of 2,000 years in what is now England.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Gregori Galofré-Vilà from the University of Oxford, analyzed skeletal remains of men aged between 21 and 49 years from various archaeological excavations across England. They used femur length to estimate individuals' full heights. Height is recognized as a good measure of well-being, as it is closely linked to childhood nutrition. Although genetics play a role in individual height, changes in economic, social, and environmental circumstances are reflected in the average height of different groups of people at any given time.\n\nThe study revealed some intriguing results. Men in the Roman-occupied area of Britain experienced an increase in average height, rising from 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in. This coincided with the Romans' improved water supply, sanitation systems, and a more diverse diet. The decline in height did not occur immediately after the Romans left in 410, but rather started around 600. Previous research suggests that health deteriorated when people moved out of the towns and cities established by the Romans, abandoning their hygienic water supplies and waste-disposal systems. Plagues and infectious diseases became more common during this time, and archaeological evidence indicates that diets were insufficient.\n\nHowever, following the devastating Black Death of 1348-1350, average heights increased again. This coincided with a boost in agricultural production. From 1400 to the early 1650s, mean height reached 5ft 8½in, similar to heights in the 20th century. The early years of the 1600s were particularly healthy, possibly due to the introduction of poor laws that contributed to better health among poorer sections of society. Height then declined until the early 1800s, reaching just 5ft 6½in.\n\nThe study compared the average heights of Englishmen with previous research conducted by Richard Steckel of Ohio State University, who created a European health index. The evidence from both sets of research aligns with each other, suggesting a consistent history. Interestingly, the Oxford-led study indicates that the English may have fared better during the \"Little Ice Age\" compared to continental Europe. This period of cooling followed the medieval warm period and had more pronounced health effects elsewhere.\n\nLooking towards the future, it seems that Englishmen's average height has been on an upward trajectory since the early 19th century. Heights have increased substantially, reaching 5ft 10in in 1970, making the English one of the tallest populations worldwide. This remarkable rise in average heights within the last century surpasses any recorded period in history.\n\nIn conclusion, this research sheds new light on the development of health in England over a long period. It highlights the positive impact of Roman occupation, the challenges faced after their departure, and the subsequent recovery and growth of height throughout history. The future looks promising in terms of increasing heights, suggesting an overall improvement in well-being. END"}

Out of these, over a quarter have crossed borders to become refugees. They are fleeing from war and authoritarianism in countries like Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Ukraine. These individuals have the right to seek sanctuary, and it is our obligation to welcome them. Not only is it a human rights duty, but it also brings tremendous benefits to the receiving countries.\n\nAt our Refugee Studies Centre, our research consistently shows that refugees possess valuable skills, talents, and aspirations that they bring to the communities that host them. Drawing on Oxford University's rich history, we have a longstanding tradition of welcoming refugees, dating back to the Second World War when we provided support to refugee academics. This support continues today, including assistance to students and academics affected by the conflict in Ukraine. We have documented the remarkable contributions made by refugee scholars in our community in the book \"The Ark of Civilization: Refugee Scholars and Oxford University, 1930-45.\"\n\nWelcoming students from displaced backgrounds enhances the richness of our community. In our M.Sc. in Refugee and Forced Migration Studies program, for example, 10 out of 29 students in this year's cohort have lived experience of displacement. Their diverse perspectives from all around the world have greatly enriched the learning environment for everyone, including faculty members.\n\nCreating a community of welcome for sanctuary seekers is a top priority for us. Mansfield and Somerville colleges were both awarded the College of Sanctuary status in 2021, and they now offer fully funded scholarships for postgraduate study. In addition, the university and colleges have increased the number of full scholarships available to graduate students from displacement backgrounds. This academic year, we swiftly responded to the crisis in Ukraine by establishing the Ukraine Graduate Scholars Program. Furthermore, we have piloted the Refugee Academic Futures Scholarship Programs, which combine the university's refugee scholarships with a support network and cohort program for all students across Oxford who identify as having a displacement background. For the academic year 2022-2023, at least 36 students with displacement backgrounds were awarded full scholarships for graduate degrees at Oxford.\n\nLooking ahead to 2023-2024, welcoming these students is not only the right thing to do but also ensures that we are recruiting talented individuals from the widest and most diverse pool of applicants. We anticipate a similar number of scholarships being awarded in 2023-2024, thanks to the support of new scholarship funding from organizations like the Mastercard Foundation, XTX Markets, and the Weidenfeld Hoffmann Trust's Hope Scholarships.\n\nNext year, our pan-university cohort program will be relaunched as the \"Oxford Sanctuary Community,\" and we aim to secure even more internal and external funding for graduate and undergraduate scholarships for sanctuary scholars from all parts of the world.\n\nOxford has applied to be recognized as a University of Sanctuary, a status currently held by 24 universities across the country. To achieve this, we have to meet certain criteria and endorse the City of Sanctuary Charter. We hope to receive confirmation soon regarding the outcome of our application. The process of applying has brought together colleagues from across the university, colleges, and the city, highlighting our collective commitment to this cause.\n\nTo get involved and learn more, we are organizing a Sanctuary Fair on 11 May in collaboration with the local NGO, Asylum Welcome. This event will bring together refugees, students, and the local community and will feature panel discussions, workshops, and stalls. Its aim is to raise awareness and foster connections between civil society organizations working in Oxford and students, staff, and the community. The fair will run from 10:30 am to 6:30 pm, and everyone is welcome to attend. We invite you to join us and be part of this important event. END"}

The book, authored by Alexander Ross, a current research student in Oxford's Faculty of History, explores the creative entrepreneurs who saved Hollywood studios in the 1970s by establishing the calculated blockbuster as the dominant business model. Ross demonstrates how visionary individuals like Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas, and Zemeckis played a pivotal role in creating this modern blockbuster model.\n\nHowever, with the rise of streaming giants like Netflix and the struggle of traditional studios to compete, many viewers now decide what to watch from the comfort of their homes. This shift has made the distinction between \"cinema\" and \"television\" seem outdated and has opened up new opportunities for innovative filmmakers to focus on their art rather than purely box office revenues. Ross reexamines the history of those pioneering 1970s blockbusters and offers insightful analysis on the future of the calculated blockbuster, questioning whether streaming platforms will continue to generate their own content and eventually take control.\n\nFilm studies scholars, screenwriters, and enthusiasts of popular culture will find this book particularly intriguing. The author, an alumnus of Oxford's New College from 2008, has an interesting backstory. Initially involved in human viral genetics research at Oxford in 1996, he stumbled upon the early internet, which changed the course of his career. After teaching himself programming and weathering the dot-com crash, he found himself writing spam filters just as spam became a widespread issue. During his work, he discovered nation-state cyberattacks that were being blocked by their filters, which sparked his interest in threat intelligence. Eventually, realizing the lack of educational resources for this field, he compiled the textbook he wished he had when he began his journey.\n\nIn summary, Michael Levin and Nora Jean have a fascinating tale to tell, filled with historical significance, remarkable achievements, and a vision for the future. Their book, alongside Alexander Ross's analysis of the blockbuster business model and the evolving landscape of the film industry, offers valuable insight for a wide range of readers. END"}

The purpose of this two-day retreat was to brainstorm and develop curricula in the emerging field of environmental justice, which combines environmental concerns with equity and civil rights. This topic is of great interest to Professor Beckfield, who is well-known for his work on social stratification, population health, and climate change.\n\nThe retreat took place at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod and included six faculty members, two graduate students, and a special guest speaker, Professor Tamarra James-Todd from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The participants represented a variety of departments, such as anthropology, history, government, philosophy, and sociology. Professor Beckfield noted that Professor James-Todd was particularly knowledgeable in the field of environmental justice and added valuable insights to the discussions.\n\nDuring the retreat, the group had the privilege of hearing from guest speaker Professor Hiʻilei Julia Kawehipuaakahaopulani Hobart, an assistant professor at Yale University specializing in indigenous studies and food justice. Professor Beckfield described her talk as inspiring and a great example of how to approach pedagogy in the field of environmental justice.\n\nThe retreat was a response to the 2022 Future of Climate Education at Harvard University report, which emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to climate-focused education. In collaboration with Professor Lawrence D. Bobo, the Dean of Social Sciences and W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of the Social Sciences, Professor Beckfield organized this retreat to generate new ideas for climate-related classes, seminars, and campus-wide collaborations.\n\nAs these innovative ideas are implemented, you can expect to see the theme of environmental justice appear more frequently in newsletters, event listings, and the college course catalogue. Additionally, the FAS Dean's Office and Office of Undergraduate Education plans to fund more retreats in off-campus settings over the next two summers, providing faculty with the opportunity to connect with nature and further explore climate-focused topics.\n\nProfessor Beckfield believes that being in a setting like Woods Hole makes it easier to stay focused on climate-related issues. If you are a faculty member at FAS and are interested in leading or participating in future retreats, you can find more information on the Office of Undergraduate Education webpage. END"}

This also raises concerns about the potential impact on artists and creators. We spoke with various faculty members involved in the production of art, including a writer, film animator, architect, musician, and mixed-media artist, to get their perspectives on whether AI is a threat, collaborator, or a tool to enhance their creativity and imagination. Please note that these interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nOne of the faculty members, who recently judged a story contest, found the experience to be an indicator of the challenges AI might face in creating good writing versus exceptional writing. The best human-written stories stood out for their unique perspectives on the world, linguistic originality, and personal experiences that added an inimitable touch. On the other hand, some well-crafted stories lacked these elements of originality and surprise. While AI can mimic and learn quickly, it is believed to lack true insight and personal experience. Commercial genres with easily recognizable styles and tropes are at particular risk. Even autofiction, with its introspective first-person narrators, can be easily mimicked, but what may be absent is the genuine vision derived from living in the physical world.\n\nWhen it comes to music, the performative aspect is not a concern for one of the faculty members. Music has the power to convey and represent emotions, something that AI is currently unable to do. In genres like jazz and creative music, the magic happens through spontaneous collaboration on stage, something AI cannot reproduce without intelligence, curiosity, and a musical vocabulary. Only then can a musician truly react and create music at the moment.\n\nRegarding music composition, AI has been used in film and television for several years now. While this raises concerns about AI taking over the work of musicians, the compositions lack surprise, emotion, and even silence. The faculty member values dramatic elements and emotional depth in music, which AI has not yet achieved.\n\nHowever, the way music reaches people has undergone significant changes with the advent of technology. Platforms like Spotify, YouTube, and iTunes use algorithms to recommend music based on listening habits, and AI plays a role in this process. Musicians hope that algorithms will also highlight lesser-known composers rather than just promoting already popular ones. The aim is to democratize the field and expose people to musical traditions beyond the mainstream, not limited to the Western world.\n\nIt is crucial to embrace AI with open arms and explore its potential in creative ways. Initially, any new technology is seen as a threat to the status quo, just like radio was when it was first introduced. Resistance to innovation has always been present. However, it's important to remember that these innovations are the result of human creation and ingenuity. As musicians, we should be open-minded and willing to work with the knowledge and innovation that AI can offer. END"}

Chan School of Public Health has found that following a Mediterranean lifestyle can greatly reduce the risk of mortality from various causes, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. The study, which was published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, emphasizes the importance of incorporating healthy eating habits, such as consuming plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while also limiting added salts and sugars. In addition, the study highlights the significance of practicing adequate rest, engaging in physical activity, and fostering social connections.\n\nThe researchers examined the habits of 110,799 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort, which represents a diverse population across England, Wales, and Scotland. Using the Mediterranean Lifestyle (MedLife) Index, which combines a lifestyle questionnaire and diet assessments, the participants' adherence to three key categories was measured. These categories included Mediterranean food consumption, Mediterranean dietary habits, and physical activity, rest, and social habits and conviviality. Higher scores in these categories indicated a closer adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle.\n\nAfter a follow-up period of nine years, the researchers analyzed the health outcomes of the participants. They discovered a significant inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle and the risk of mortality. Those with higher MedLife scores had a 29 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 28 percent lower risk of cancer mortality compared to those with lower scores. Adherence to each MedLife category independently was associated with lower risks of all-cause and cancer mortality. The category that showed the strongest association with reduced risk was physical activity, rest, and social habits and conviviality. Furthermore, this category was also linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality.\n\nThis study is particularly important because it demonstrates that the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle can be adopted and beneficially utilized by populations outside the Mediterranean region. Lead author Mercedes Sotos Prieto, Ramon y Cajal research fellow at la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and adjunct assistant professor of environmental health at the Harvard Chan School, suggests that people can incorporate locally available products and adapt the overall Mediterranean lifestyle to their own cultural contexts. This shows the potential for the lifestyle's positive effects on health to be transferred to different populations.\n\nIn summary, this study confirms the numerous health benefits associated with a Mediterranean lifestyle. It promotes the consumption of wholesome foods, a balanced diet, physical activity, rest, and social engagement. By adopting these habits, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of mortality from various causes, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. END"}

Trump have announced that they will be running for the White House in the 2024 election. However, recent polls have shown that many Americans have concerns about their age and whether they are fit to serve another term. Some worry that President Biden, who is 80, lacks the mental sharpness or physical health to effectively serve as president again, giving Trump an advantage. It is important to note that while concerns about age have some validity, each individual case can be different. It is also worth considering that drawing conclusions about fitness based on insignificant or unreliable indicators is a growing issue, especially as leaders are living longer and remaining in office. The current median age in the U.S. Senate is 65 and nearly 58 in the House. Age was historically seen as a flaw in presidential candidates, as seen with Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. However, the fixation on age among both Democratic and Republican Party front-runners is a relatively new development. With Biden and Trump being two of the oldest presidents in history, it is understandable that age is a legitimate factor for many voters to consider. It is not just a matter of capability but also concerns about health and potential in-office mortality. Interestingly, Bernie Sanders faced little age criticism when he ran for president at 75 and 79, suggesting that concerns about age may really reflect a desire for energetic leadership, new ideas, and new energy. On the right, there has been a relentless political branding strategy to paint Biden as physically and intellectually unfit for office since the 2020 primaries. Republican candidate Nikki Haley, 51, has even predicted that Biden will not live long enough to serve a second term and has proposed mental competency tests for politicians over 75. So far, age and health have been less of a political vulnerability for Trump compared to Biden, as voters have other overriding concerns about him. Corporate America often requires senior executives to retire in their mid-60s or early 70s, and top institutional leaders are rarely hired from this age group. However, there is no age limit for presidents according to the constitution, leaving prospective voters to apply their own standards when judging a candidate's fitness for office. It is important to recognize that assessing someone's mental or physical fitness based on brief observations of their speech, memory, or motor function is highly unreliable. Cognitive acuity and name retrieval abilities can vary greatly and may not be indicative of overall fitness for office. Executive function, which includes higher-order reasoning, problem-solving, and abstract thinking, is a more important metric. It is also crucial to consider how well individuals function in their real-world environment, whether it be a surgeon in the operating room or a president in the Oval Office. In a recent TV interview, Biden highlighted his \"wisdom\" and \"experience\" as reasons why voters should re-elect someone who will be 82 on Inauguration Day. There is some validity to the notion that age brings wisdom, and physical health plays a significant role in cognitive performance. People often underestimate the influence of physical health on cognitive functioning. In conclusion, while concerns about age and fitness for office are understandable, it is vital to use more comprehensive metrics and not rely solely on external observations. END"}
{"prompt":"is the globe’s thirst for oil finally topping out ? a major international energy watcher says yes , predicting last month that demand for global oil for transport will peak around 2026 , plateau for all uses by 2028 , and possibly hit a zenith by the end of the decade . harvard experts say the forecasts track with what’s going on in the developed world , where climate change concerns have fostered a push to electrify transportation , boost renewables , and reduce fossil fuels . but , they say , the energy needs of less-wealthy nations pressing to develop their economies could foil expectations for years to come . the international energy agency , established by the organization for economic co-operation and development in the 1970s to provide energy data and policy advice , predicted that demand for oil for transportation would peak in 2026 as a result of electric-vehicle ( ev ) adoption , biofuel growth , and improved fuel economy . it predicted increases in demand in all sectors would slow from 2 . 4 million barrels per day this year to just 0 . 4 million barrels per day in 2028 , with a potential overall peak by 2030 . henry lee , the jassim m . jaidah family director of the harvard kennedy school’s environmental and natural resource program and senior lecturer in public policy , said despite many variables at play , he wouldn’t be surprised if the peak of oil use for transportation is achieved by 2026 . even if that proves too rosy , it’s still likely to be achieved by early in the next decade , he said . lee said he’s been surprised at how quickly parts of the world are moving toward ev adoption . in china , the world’s largest auto market , electric vehicle sales in the first five months of 2023 were up by 26 percent . sales by byd auto , china’s largest ev maker , are up 92 percent this year , he said . likewise , american companies have poured resources into ev design and manufacturing . both ford and gm are planning to release new models in 2025 , 2026 , and 2027 , lee said , while volkswagen , with new vehicles planned for 2026 and 2027 , expects the majority of its fleet to be electric soon . “ford and gm , driven by the california regulations , have invested billions of dollars in developing electric vehicles , ” lee said . “there is this huge investment , and it’s too late to change it . ” last august , officials in sacramento declared that by 2035 all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the state — the nation’s largest auto market — must be electric or emission-free . but this momentum doesn’t mean the pieces are all in place , nor does it guarantee a smooth transition , lee said . significant hurdles remain regarding electricity pricing and building charging infrastructure . the cost to charge vehicles is artificially low , lee said , which is alright for now because evs are a small part of the market . but the situation will need to be fixed as more electric cars hit the road , and the solution is unclear . in addition considerable investment is still needed to ensure there will be sufficient charging stations , transmission lines , smart transformers , and energy storage , lee said . some of the necessary funds were approved in the 2022 inflation reduction act , but lee said private investment seven or eight times greater is still needed . automakers recognize this , and ford and gm announced in june an agreement to adopt tesla’s charging technology platform , which means their cars will be able to use tesla’s nationwide network . industrialized nations are using regulation and market forces to foster a shift away from fossil fuels , but the wild card for the iea’s forecast involves the developing world , experts said . globally , oil isn’t used heavily for electricity generation , but that’s less true in some developing nations where gasoline and diesel generators supplement small or unreliable grids and where liquified petroleum gas ( lpg ) is used for cooking , transport , and even heating . a 2014 study by the world bank , for example , estimated that electricity demand in nigeria was 8 , 000 to 10 , 000 megawatts , but just 3 , 500 of those came from the national electric grid . much of the shortfall was made up by gasoline and diesel-powered generators , the report said . ->","completion":" Is the world's demand for oil finally starting to decrease?

By the end of the decade, it may even begin to decline. Harvard's experts agree with these forecasts, as they align with the efforts being made in developed countries to combat climate change by shifting towards electric transportation, renewable energy, and reducing the use of fossil fuels.\n\nHowever, these experts also acknowledge that the energy needs of less wealthy nations, who are striving to develop their economies, could disrupt these expectations in the years to come. The International Energy Agency, which has been providing energy data and policy advice since the 1970s, predicts that the demand for oil in transportation will peak in 2026 due to the adoption of electric vehicles, growth in biofuels, and improved fuel efficiency. They expect an overall slowdown in demand growth across all sectors, from 2.4 million barrels per day this year to just 0.4 million barrels per day in 2028, with a potential peak in demand by 2030.\n\nHenry Lee, an expert from Harvard, believes that the peak in oil use for transportation could be achieved as early as 2026, and even if it takes a bit longer, it is still likely to happen by the early 2030s. Lee has been pleasantly surprised by the speed at which certain parts of the world, such as China and the United States, are transitioning to electric vehicles. China, the largest auto market globally, has seen a 26% increase in electric vehicle sales in the first five months of 2023. American companies like Ford, GM, and Volkswagen are also investing heavily in electric vehicle development.\n\nHowever, despite this progress, Lee emphasizes that the transition won't be without its challenges. There are still hurdles to overcome, such as electricity pricing and the establishment of a robust charging infrastructure. The cost of charging vehicles is currently low, but this will need to change as electric cars become more prevalent. Additionally, significant investment is required to ensure an adequate number of charging stations, transmission lines, smart transformers, and energy storage. While some funding has been approved, more private investment is still needed.\n\nIndustrialized nations are using regulation and market forces to drive the shift away from fossil fuels. However, experts point out that the developing world is the wild card in the International Energy Agency's forecast. In some developing nations, oil is still heavily used for electricity generation, and gasoline and diesel generators are relied upon to supplement unreliable grids. For example, in Nigeria, a significant portion of electricity demand is met by gasoline and diesel-powered generators due to a shortage in the national electric grid.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are positive signs that the world's demand for oil is reaching its peak, there are still challenges to overcome. The transition to electric transportation and renewable energy will require further investment and infrastructure development. Additionally, the energy needs of developing nations remain a factor that could affect the overall forecast. Nevertheless, the progress made by various countries in reducing their reliance on oil is encouraging and paves the way for a more sustainable future. END"}

The World Health Organization estimates that indoor air pollution, often caused by cooking fires, resulted in 3.2 million deaths worldwide in 2020. Lassiter acknowledges that rich countries have the freedom to make choices, but poor countries are focused on providing their citizens with energy around the clock for economic development and well-being. As a result, fossil-fuel power plants and refineries will continue to be built, and coal, gasoline, LPG, and diesel will still be used as fuels. Lassiter predicts that global oil demand will not peak for many years, if not decades, as the global south will continue to consume oil. However, he believes that nuclear power remains a viable option for affordable, reliable, and carbon-free energy, especially in the developing world where Chinese and Korean-designed plants are available. The transition to electric vehicles in the developing world may face challenges due to less robust power infrastructure, making it harder for consumers to charge their cars. Additionally, many developing countries rely on imported cars, which will increasingly be electric models. Lauren Cohen suggests that developing nations, including China, India, Southeast Asia, and Africa, will play a crucial role in shaping the future of energy and can contribute to the shift towards renewable sources. While oil companies may be impacted by a potential decline in demand, some will continue to focus on fossil fuels while others will adapt to greener alternatives. Companies that prioritize green innovation have already demonstrated their commitment through patents and foundational aspects of alternative energy. END"}

He argues that one-size-fits-all solutions developed in highly developed cities like Los Angeles and London may not be effective due to unique local conditions. Molina points to examples in Mexico City and Beijing to highlight the need for new knowledge and innovative policy solutions to tackle the thick smog that plagues urban areas. In Beijing, efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide have been successful in cutting pollutant levels but have not truly improved air quality. Laboratory studies have shown that nitrogen oxides and ammonia also contribute to the formation of smog through a complex chain of reactions. In Mexico City, government efforts to curb air pollution have been ineffective as they have not fully considered local customs and cultures. For instance, a program to ban cars on high-pollution days led to people buying second cars, often older and more polluting, to get to work. Molina, a distinguished professor at the University of California, emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing specific local challenges. \n\nMolina, along with F. Sherwood Rowland and Paul J. Crutzen, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their groundbreaking work on chlorofluorocarbons and atmospheric ozone. Their research highlighted the threat to the ozone layer in the stratosphere, which shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. As a result, the Montreal Protocol was established in 1987 by 197 countries to phase out the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons. In recent years, observations have shown that the ozone hole over Antarctica is gradually closing, making the Montreal Protocol a successful model for global environmental cooperation. \n\nDuring his talk to Harvard's Science Center, Molina emphasized the need for further research and collaboration to address global environmental challenges. He recalled how, in his youth, he could easily see the mountains surrounding Mexico City, but now they are obscured by air pollution caused by population growth and associated emissions. Mexico City has focused its pollution control efforts on ozone reduction, following the model of Los Angeles, with some success. However, this approach has not effectively reduced harmful particulate matter or alleviated traffic congestion. Molina suggests that improving public transportation is a key strategy to reduce automobile pollution, but viable alternatives need to be developed and promoted. \n\nMolina also stressed the importance of continued scientific and policy advancements. He believes that solutions found in Mexico City could benefit other developing cities, like those in China, and vice versa. It is crucial to recognize that there is still much to learn, and that collaboration is essential. Molina expressed concern that the United States may be on a path of increasing carbon dioxide emissions, rather than making the necessary cuts to avoid alarming global temperature increases. He highlighted the uncertainty surrounding climate change predictions, with estimations suggesting a one-in-five chance of global temperatures rising more than originally anticipated, leading to catastrophic consequences for future generations.

A great example of this is John Collins' world-record paper airplane. Last Wednesday, Collins brought his amazing design, along with his enthusiasm and a few boxes of planes, to the Graduate School of Design (GSD). Collins, whose plane set the record for distance in 2012 at 226 feet, offered a workshop that used paper airplanes as a teaching tool. He spoke to a group of students about making planes, including design, goals, and materials. As he explained the process, he encouraged students to do something that would have gotten them in trouble in high school: making and flying paper airplanes in class. \n\nCollins emphasized that when it comes to design solutions, they have to work. He said, \"If you can wad up a piece of paper and throw it farther than your paper airplane, your plane is not good.\" Collins' talk covered topics such as glide ratios, center of gravity, center of lift, the boundary layer, and the Magnus effect. Drawing on his experience with origami, Collins introduced students to the complex folds of their first plane, which had a thick hexagonal front. He explained how a small fold here or there can improve flight by shifting the center of gravity or preventing a nosedive by tweaking a wing's trailing edge. Along the way, he provided insight into his process of designing 75 original planes. \n\nThis workshop, along with the previous night's lecture at Gund Hall, was part of the new Master in Design Engineering (MDE) program offered jointly by GSD and the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). Kevin Kit Parker, the Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics, who arranged Collins' visit, said, \"My goal was to bring in someone who thinks outside the box and has taken a nontraditional path to speak to our students. Innovation can come in many forms, not just through formal education. Before being innovative, one must live a creative life, and John certainly does.\" \n\nMartin Bechthold, the Kumagai Professor of Architectural Technology and MDE co-director, explained that the program aims to train students to analyze and solve problems that span various disciplines and scales. One challenge they face is the lack of readily available data for such problems. Throughout their two years of study, students will work in multidisciplinary teams, where collaboration will be crucial for success. \n\nCollins, a former television producer and director whose love for paper airplanes never faded, achieved his world record by taking a different approach than the previous champion, who flew a basic dart that every kid knows how to make. Instead of relying on brute force like the dart, Collins aimed for the perfect balance of float. In a conversation after the classroom session, Collins shared one of the most valuable lessons from his achievement: you may fail in any attempt, but you're only defeated when you give up. He also offered a tip to paper plane enthusiasts frustrated by planes that don't fly well: instead of folding another one, make adjustments to the one you already have. \"Treat every flight like a test flight, observe what it's doing,\" Collins advised. \"You can improve the flight of a poorly folded plane.\" \n\nDuring the workshop, students had the opportunity to make three different flying forms: a plane, a flying ring, and a tumbling wing that spins as it floats on the updraft from a rectangular piece of cardboard moving at walking speed. Graduate student Seungkuk Ahn found it fascinating to take a scientific approach to such a seemingly simple problem. \"This was really fun, and we learned a lot about design criteria effortlessly,\" Ahn shared. \"The best way to learn is in person.\" END"}
{"prompt":"no one who has ever worried about toxic chemicals in the everyday environment would have had his or her fears allayed by attending the harvard t . h . chan school of public health forum “hormone-altering chemicals fertility and health implications . ” presented jointly with the huffington post , whose senior living editor , erin schumaker , was the moderator , the panel focused on chemicals that affect the endocrine system , and their effects on fertility and childbirth . but the central point of the talk was contained in four words , screened in a video by the environmental working group “toxic chemicals are everywhere . ” the panel opened tuesday afternoon with some sobering statistics everyday products —personal hygiene products , medications , food packaging , objects such as window blinds — contain more than 10 , 000 chemicals that have not been approved by the food and drug administration , and many of them are banned in china and the european union . russ hauser , acting chair of the department of environmental health at the harvard chan school , said many of these chemicals are endocrine disruptors , which can interfere with common metabolism , the immune system , and fertility in men and women . “our exposure may be at very low levels , ” he noted . “but there is data suggesting that even that can have an effect on humans . ” tamarra james-todd , professor of environmental reproductive and perinatal epidemiology at the harvard chan school , added that certain populations — including pregnant women and minorities — are especially at risk . she said chemicals used in cosmetics and industrial products are related to glucose disruption , which can lead to type ii diabetes that pregnant women can pass on to their children . another vulnerable group is teenage women , said nneka leiba , deputy director of research for the environmental working group . that’s partly because teens tend to use more cosmetics and other personal products than adult women , she said . “we tested for 25 chemicals in teenage girls and found that 16 of them were present , and these were the ones associated with endocrine disruption . and what’s going on during adolescence ? there’s complicated hormonal signaling that guides development of the brain and the immune system . ” even if teens don’t use those personal products , they may encounter the same chemicals through waterproof clothing or nonstick cookware . “it really is ubiquitous . ” speaking via skype from europe , pete myers , ceo and chief scientist of environmental health sciences , focused on the obstacles to effective regulation . myers , who has been working on the issue since the ’80s , emphasized that endocrine-disrupting chemicals are a recognized danger , classified by the world health organization as a global health threat . yet they aren’t regulated in the united states as such . “there are many reasons regulation has advanced slowly , but the big one is money , ” he said . “if regulators were to act on the science we have in hand now , it would require multiple products to be taken off the market . there are games that people play to make that not happen . the money [generated by those products] pays for a lot of lawyers . we face a system that makes the movement of science into regulation move very slowly , and in some cases backwards . ” still , consumers aren’t entirely powerless . leiba’s organization , the environmental working group , maintains a database of products that are rated for their chemical safety . and she noted a positive sign in last year’s rewriting of the toxic substances control act , which was introduced in the ’70s and was badly in need of an update . in 2016 , it was expanded to give more regulatory power to the environmental protection agency , but schumaker pointed out that the act’s future is uncertain under the new president . leiba said that the senate’s recent approval of scott pruitt to lead the epa may not be a good sign , since pruitt fought against regulations on toxic emissions when he was attorney general of oklahoma . all four panelists agreed that the one thing that was most needed was stronger government regulation , but nobody seemed optimistic it would be coming anytime soon . “what i’d look for , ” myers said , “is a package of policies that move us into a world in which moms don’t have to be chemical engineers to go shopping for their kids . ” ->","completion":" If you've ever worried about toxic chemicals in your everyday environment, you wouldn't have found reassurance at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health forum on \"Hormone-Altering Chemicals: Fertility and Health Implications.\" Presented in collaboration with The Huffington Post and moderated by Erin Schumaker, the panel's focus was on chemicals that impact the endocrine system and their effects on fertility and childbirth. The main message of the discussion was succinctly conveyed in a video by the Environmental Working Group: \"Toxic chemicals are everywhere.\"\n\nDuring the panel, some alarming statistics were shared. Everyday products, such as personal hygiene products, medications, food packaging, and even window blinds, contain over 10,000 chemicals that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Many of these chemicals are actually banned in China and the European Union. Russ Hauser, Acting Chair of the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard Chan School, explained that these chemicals are known as endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with our metabolism, immune system, and fertility in both men and women. He emphasized that even exposure to low levels of these chemicals can have adverse effects on humans.\n\nTamarra James-Todd, a Professor of Environmental Reproductive and Perinatal Epidemiology at Harvard Chan School, highlighted that certain populations, such as pregnant women and minorities, are particularly vulnerable. Chemicals used in cosmetics and industrial products can disrupt glucose regulation, potentially leading to type II diabetes that can be passed on to children by pregnant women. Teenage women are also at risk because they tend to use more cosmetics and personal products than adult women. Nneka Leiba, Deputy Director of Research for the Environmental Working Group, shared that they tested 25 chemicals in teenage girls and found 16 of them to be present, all associated with endocrine disruption. This is concerning as adolescence is a critical period for the development of the brain and immune system, both of which rely on complex hormonal signaling.\n\nThese toxic chemicals are not only present in personal products but can also be found in waterproof clothing and nonstick cookware. Their ubiquity is concerning.\n\nPete Myers, CEO and Chief Scientist of Environmental Health Sciences, joined the panel via Skype from Europe and focused on the challenges of effective regulation. Myers, who has been working on this issue since the 1980s, emphasized that endocrine-disrupting chemicals are globally recognized as a health threat by the World Health Organization. However, they are not regulated as such in the United States. He explained that slow progress in regulation is largely due to financial interests. Taking action based on the current scientific knowledge would require removing multiple products from the market, and this doesn't align with the financial interests of those involved. Unfortunately, science-to-regulation processes often move slowly or even regress.\n\nDespite these challenges, consumers do have some power. The Environmental Working Group maintains a database of products that are rated for their chemical safety. Additionally, last year's update of the Toxic Substances Control Act, which was introduced in the 1970s, gave more regulatory power to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, the future of this act is uncertain under the new administration. Scott Pruitt's recent approval as the head of the EPA is seen by some as a potential setback since he has previously fought against regulations on toxic emissions as the Attorney General of Oklahoma. All panelists agreed that stronger government regulation is needed, but they were not optimistic about significant changes happening in the near future.\n\nPete Myers summed it up best when he said, \"What I'd look for is a package of policies that move us into a world in which moms don't have to be chemical engineers to go shopping for their kids.\" END"}
{"prompt":"when most people hear the word psychopath , they immediately think of a hannibal lecter–style serial killer who is cold , calculating , emotionless , willing to do or say anything to get their desire . and they’re not alone . for decades , researchers studying psychopathy have characterized the disorder as a profound inability to process emotions such as empathy , remorse , or regret . a recent study , though , suggests that psychopaths are not incapable of feeling emotions like regret and disappointment . what they cannot do , it seems , is make accurate predictions about the outcomes of their choices . the study , co-authored by joshua buckholtz , associate professor of psychology at harvard , and arielle baskin-sommers , assistant professor of psychology and of psychiatry at yale university , offers a new model of the disorder that could shed important light on the decision-making process of psychopaths . the study was published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . “the assumption has always been that they make these bad choices because they can’t generate negative emotions like fear , or appropriately respond to emotional signals generated by other people … but we turned that idea on its head . ” using an economic game , buckholtz and baskin-sommers were able to show that while psychopaths have normal , or even enhanced , emotional responses in situations that typically elicit regret , they have trouble extracting information from the environment that would indicate that an action they’re about to take will result in the experience of regret . “there are two components to regret , ” buckholtz explained . “there is retrospective regret , which is how we usually think about regret — the emotional experience after you learn you could have received a better outcome if you had made a different choice . but we also use signals from our environment to make predictions about which actions will or won’t result in regret . what differentiated psychopaths from other people was their inability to use those prospective regret signals , to use information about the choices they were given to anticipate how much regret they were going to experience , and adjust their decision-making accordingly . “it’s almost like a blindness to future regret , ” he added . “when something happens , they feel regret , but what they can’t do is look forward and use information that would tell them they’re going to feel regret to guide their decision-making . ” “these findings highlight that psychopathic individuals are not simply incapable of regret [or other emotions] , but that there is a more nuanced dysfunction that gets in the way of their adaptive functioning , ” baskin-sommers said . “by appreciating this complexity , we are poised to develop more accurate methods for predicting the costly behavior of psychopathic individuals . ” using a measure of prospective regret sensitivity , buckholtz and baskin-sommers were also able to predict whether and even how many times study participants had been incarcerated . “contrary to what you would expect based on these basic emotional-deficit models , their emotional responses to regret didn’t predict incarceration , ” buckholtz said . “we know psychopathy is one of the biggest predictors of criminal behavior , but what we found was that behavioral regret sensitivity moderated that , raising the suggestion that intact behavioral regret sensitivity could be a protective factor against incarceration in psychopathic individuals . ” while the study upends the pop-culture image of psychopaths , buckholtz is hopeful that it will also provide a new direction for scientists who hope to understand how psychopaths make decisions . “we actually know very little about how psychopaths make choices , ” he said . “there have been all sorts of research into their emotions and emotional experience , but we know next to nothing about how they integrate information that we extract from the world as a matter of course and use it to make decisions in daily lives . getting better insight into why psychopaths make such terrible choices , i think , is going to be very important for the next generation of psychopathy research . ” ->","completion":" When most people hear the word \"psychopath,\" they often picture a cold and calculating serial killer like Hannibal Lecter, someone who lacks emotions and will do anything to achieve their desires. However, recent research suggests that this common perception might not be entirely accurate. Psychopaths are not completely incapable of feeling emotions like regret and disappointment. Instead, they struggle with accurately predicting the outcomes of their choices.\n\nA study conducted by Joshua Buckholtz, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard, and Arielle Baskin-Sommers, an assistant professor of psychology and psychiatry at Yale University, offers a new perspective on psychopathy. Their study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, sheds light on the decision-making process of psychopaths. Contrary to previous beliefs, psychopaths do experience normal or even heightened emotional responses in situations that typically elicit regret. However, they struggle to extract information from their environment that would indicate whether their actions will lead to regret.\n\nBuckholtz explains that regret has two components. The first is retrospective regret, the emotional experience that follows the realization that a better outcome could have been achieved through a different choice. The second component involves using signals from the environment to predict whether an action will result in regret. Psychopaths struggle with this second component, their inability to use prospective regret signals and adjust their decision-making accordingly. It's almost like they are blind to future regret and cannot use information to guide their choices.\n\nBaskin-Sommers emphasizes that psychopathic individuals are not simply unable to experience regret or other emotions. Instead, a more nuanced dysfunction hinders their adaptive functioning. By recognizing this complexity, researchers can develop more accurate methods for predicting the harmful behavior of psychopathic individuals.\n\nBuckholtz and Baskin-Sommers also found that their measure of prospective regret sensitivity could predict whether and how many times study participants had been incarcerated. Surprisingly, the emotional responses to regret did not directly predict incarceration rates. This suggests that intact behavioral regret sensitivity, the ability to consider potential regrets before making decisions, could be a protective factor against incarceration in psychopathic individuals.\n\nThis study challenges the popular portrayal of psychopaths in the media. Buckholtz hopes that it will provide researchers with a new direction to understand how psychopaths make decisions. While there has been extensive research into their emotions and emotional experiences, little is known about how they integrate information from the world to make choices in their daily lives. Gaining insight into why psychopaths make such poor decisions will be crucial for future research on psychopathy. END"}

It is joined by the monkey, the antelope, the grizzly bear, the wild dog, and the Siberian tiger. Look around this dimly lit room, and you'll discover other animals that are slowly vanishing or have already disappeared. The heath hen, which became extinct in 1932, the great auk, last observed in 1844, and New Zealand's flightless moa, which only survived a few hundred years after humans arrived, around 1300. These specimens of threatened, endangered, and extinct species, all from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), are now part of a captivating new exhibit at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH).\n\nNamed \"Next of Kin: Seeing Extinction Through the Artist's Lens,\" this exhibition was created by visual artist Christina Seely in collaboration with the Canary Project, an organization that uses art and media to address ecological issues. Supported by a generous gift from Clark Bernard and Susana Bernard, both graduates of Harvard Business School in 1968, Seely drew inspiration from the MCZ's vast collections, which encompass an astonishing 21 million specimens, including numerous species that are considered threatened, endangered, or extinct. You can explore this thought-provoking exhibit until June 4.\n\nDuring a reception held last month, Jane Pickering, the Executive Director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, to which the HMNH belongs, explained that this exhibit represents a departure from the museum's usual focus on scientific views presented by scientists. She stated, \"This is something different, a bit of an experiment, and not all experiments succeed. However, in this case, it truly did.\" \n\nThe rapid increase in species extinction and the loss of biodiversity over the past two centuries is cause for concern. While it is uncertain whether the crisis we face today, caused by human activity, will reach the magnitude of past global mass extinctions that some experts warn of, the trends we are witnessing are worrisome. James Hanken, the Director of the MCZ and the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology, highlighted the alarming rate at which species are disappearing. He emphasized that if we continue on this trajectory, the world, including the United States, will look vastly different in 150 years compared to what we see around us today.\n\nHanken underlined that when the MCZ was established in 1859, few scientists were preoccupied with extinction and biodiversity loss. However, times have changed, and now the majority of scientists are deeply concerned about these issues. Educating the public and policymakers on urgent scientific matters is an essential part of the museum's mission. Hanken believes that incorporating an artist's perspective contributes to achieving this goal. He explained, \"Scientists typically rely on charts, graphs, and hard facts to educate. However, this approach is not always effective enough to shift public consciousness. Artists have a different way of addressing problems, appealing to our gut instincts and emotions.\"\n\nSeely's interest in extinction began during a trip to the Arctic to photograph animals. After a conversation with Pickering a year ago, she started collaborating with faculty-curators of the MCZ's mammal and bird collections to select specimens for the exhibit, which debuted just before Christmas. As a visitor, you will encounter well-lit display cases standing out in the darkness. One case contains brown boxes filled with bones of the great auk – skulls, ribs, and spines – symbolizing the bird's once thriving population across the North Atlantic. Close by, a single heath hen egg rests on a bed of soft white cotton, showcasing the care with which eggs are preserved in the collection. The last known heath hen was a male located on Martha's Vineyard.\n\nOne of the most captivating installations features striking photographs of endangered or threatened animals. These images, arranged along two walls, gradually fade from view as you watch, much like the creatures they portray. The exhibit also showcases the ear of a sei whale, a narwhal tusk, and the moa. Seely hopes that her artist's touch can help raise awareness and deepen the public's connection to critical scientific topics. She explains, \"I am intrigued by finding ways to engage the public on a deeper level with what is happening.\" END"}

They have successfully created the rarest material on Earth, known as atomic metallic hydrogen. This breakthrough discovery, which Professor Isaac Silvera and postdoctoral fellow Ranga Dias have been tirelessly working towards, has the potential to become one of the most valuable substances ever known.\n\nThis incredible material not only allows scientists to explore fundamental questions about the nature of matter, but it also holds immense promise for a wide range of applications. One particularly exciting possibility is its potential as a room-temperature superconductor. This means that it could conduct electricity without any resistance, even at normal temperatures. Imagine the impact this could have on our transportation system, enabling magnetic levitation for high-speed trains and improving the efficiency of electric cars. It could even revolutionize the performance of electronic devices and significantly enhance energy production and storage.\n\nFurthermore, metallic hydrogen could play a crucial role in space exploration. Its immense energy output makes it an incredibly powerful rocket propellant, surpassing any known fuel. With its potential to achieve a specific impulse of 1,700 seconds, compared to the current limit of 450 seconds, it could open up new possibilities for exploring the outer planets. This material could enable us to launch larger payloads and reduce the number of stages required for rocket launches, making space exploration more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nTo create this groundbreaking material, Silvera and Dias utilized synthetic diamond, one of the hardest substances on Earth. By carefully treating and polishing small pieces of diamond, they were able to create a device called a diamond anvil cell. This allowed them to subject a tiny hydrogen sample to extreme pressures surpassing 71.7 million pounds per square inch, similar to the conditions at the center of the Earth. At such intense pressures, the hydrogen transformed from a solid molecular form into atomic hydrogen, which exhibits metallic properties.\n\nAfter decades of hard work and anticipation, the results of their experiments were finally realized. Silvera expressed his excitement about the achievement, emphasizing the magnitude of creating something that has never before existed on Earth. This is truly the holy grail of high-pressure physics.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of atomic metallic hydrogen represents a major scientific breakthrough. Not only does it deepen our understanding of hydrogen and its properties, but it also opens up a world of possibilities for technological advancements. From improving transportation systems and electronic devices to revolutionizing energy production and storage, this material has the potential to transform our lives for the better.

This soft robotic sleeve, which twists and compresses in sync with the natural beating of the heart, helps to augment cardiovascular functions that may be weakened by heart failure. What sets this device apart from currently available heart assist devices is that it does not directly contact blood, reducing the risk of clotting and eliminating the need for patients to take blood thinners.\n\nThe team behind this groundbreaking research believes that the field of soft robotics can be applied to address clinical needs, ultimately reducing the burden of heart disease and improving the quality of life for patients. Ellen T. Roche, the lead author of the paper and former PhD student at Harvard, states, \"This work represents an exciting proof-of-concept result for this soft robot, demonstrating that it can safely interact with soft tissue and lead to improvements in cardiac function. We envision many other future applications where such devices can deliver mechanotherapy both inside and outside the body.\"\n\nHeart failure affects a staggering 41 million people worldwide, and current treatment options include mechanical pumps and heart transplants. However, these options still pose risks such as blood clots and stroke. To create a device that doesn't come into contact with blood, the Harvard researchers drew inspiration from the heart itself. They developed a thin silicone sleeve that uses soft pneumatic actuators to mimic the outer muscle layers of the heart. These actuators twist and compress the sleeve in a way that closely resembles the natural motion of a beating heart. Importantly, the sleeve can be personalized for each patient, providing targeted assistance where it's needed the most.\n\nThe sleeve is attached to the heart using a combination of suction, sutures, and a gel interface to minimize friction. In collaboration with surgeons from Boston Children's Hospital, the engineers at Harvard worked diligently to develop and test the device using animal models. While more research needs to be conducted before the sleeve can be implanted in humans, this research marks a crucial first step towards an implantable soft robot that can enhance organ function.\n\nAccording to Roche, this research is particularly significant given the growing number of heart attack survivors who may develop heart failure. She explains, \"Soft robotic devices are ideally suited to interact with soft tissue and provide assistance that can help with function augmentation and potentially even healing and recovery.\"\n\nThe study was supported by grants from Boston Children's Hospital, the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Science Foundation Ireland. The research involved the collaboration of various experts and was co-authored by individuals from different institutions, all committed to advancing the field of soft robotics and improving treatment options for individuals with heart failure.

Morris, a senior at Brandeis University, is facing the reality for women in physics in the United States. Despite women now making up the majority of college students in the country, they still lag behind their male peers in certain fields. Unfortunately, in disciplines like physics, women remain a small minority.\n\nHowever, last weekend, there was a ray of hope. A gathering of 250 physics majors took place at Harvard, as they collectively worked towards a new reality. The conference for undergraduate women in physics was an inclusive event featuring lab tours, insightful lectures, personal stories, and practical discussions about research, applying to graduate school, dealing with discrimination and bias, and finding mentors.\n\nThe conference was thoughtfully designed by organizer Anne Hebert, a Harvard graduate student, to connect participants with a support network that will help them succeed in the field. Hebert herself noticed the lack of girls around when she was an undergraduate, and she understands the feeling of being the only woman in the room. Ellen Klein, a fellow organizer and Harvard doctoral student, shared that while she felt supported by faculty during her time as an undergraduate at Yale, she has noticed a decline in the number of women as she advanced through academic levels. Delilah Gates, another member of the organizing committee and a Harvard doctoral student, echoed Hebert and Klein's sentiments, acknowledging that bias, although often subtle, remains an issue. They have all experienced male classmates making inappropriate jokes about women, which serves as a reminder that there is still work to be done, despite the progress that has been made.\n\nGates, being a black woman, also shared her personal experience of feeling pressure in college to prove that her opportunities were not granted solely because of her race. This left her initially uncertain about applying to graduate school, as she didn't want to be seen as just ticking a diversity of box. Gates explained, \"In college, I didn't anticipate it. I was struck by the pressure I felt because of being an African-American woman and proving that no one was handing it to me because I check off a diversity of box.\"\n\nThe campus conference, organized by the American Physical Society, was one of ten held across the United States and Canada, with Harvard hosting for the first time. Overall, approximately 1,500 women attended these sessions, creating a truly empowering atmosphere. Additionally, a workshop called \"Spin Up,\" dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups in the field, such as minorities, students with disabilities, and students from low-income families, took place prior to the Harvard conference.\n\nMasahiro Morii, chair of Harvard's physics department, expressed the importance of physics in solving society's problems. He highlighted that women, who make up half of the population, still only constitute less than 25 percent of physics graduate students. This further emphasizes the need for events like the conference to continue addressing the gender gap and supporting diversity and inclusion in the field of physics. END"}

Her team at IMASC has made significant breakthroughs in understanding how catalysis works, which could have a major impact on designing more energy-efficient catalysts. These findings have been published in a paper in Nature Materials on December 19th.\n\n\"This marks a paradigm shift in catalyst discovery,\" said Challa S. S. R. Kumar, the program's managing director. \"For more than a century, it has been a trial-and-error process. Recently, people have been striving for a more systematic approach. Our center, through collaborative efforts between investigators from partnering institutions, is establishing new principles to understand catalytic reactions under tightly controlled conditions, using computational modeling.

So when Andrew Guess from Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs got the opportunity to study the effects of social media on the 2020 election using data from two influential platforms, he was thrilled. Guess, an assistant professor, has always believed that conducting on-platform experiments to study the impact of social media on real-user behavior is crucial for understanding its role in politics. He has been involved in efforts to promote data-sharing between researchers and platforms, and he was fortunate enough to be asked to join this unique project.\n\nGuess and his team of 16 academics collaborated with researchers from Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to investigate how changes in the platforms' content delivery affected users. Their first set of research findings has been published this week in three papers in Science and one in Nature. It's important to note that the team proposed specific research questions and study designs, and Meta agreed to only reject them for legal, privacy, or feasibility reasons. They could not restrict or censor the findings, and the lead academic authors had the final say in writing and research decisions.\n\nThe researchers faced challenges because the relevant data about users' experiences and behaviors are typically inaccessible. Comprehensive evidence of the impact of social media has been scarce. However, Guess and his coauthors were able to investigate the effects of Facebook and Instagram feed algorithms on the attitudes and behavior of 23,000 consenting Facebook users and 21,000 consenting Instagram users from October to December 2020. They compared users with reverse chronologically ordered feeds (the newest content at the top) to a control group with the platforms' default algorithms. The team found that moving users out of algorithmic feeds significantly reduced their time spent on the platforms and their activities. It also influenced the type of content they saw, with an increase in political and untrustworthy content on both platforms, a decrease in uncivil and hateful content on Facebook, and a rise in content from moderate friends and ideologically mixed audiences on Facebook. However, there were no significant changes in issue polarization, affective polarization, political knowledge, or other key attitudes among users who received chronologically based content.\n\nGuess's other science paper, \"Reshares on social media amplify political news but do not detectably affect beliefs or opinions,\" explored the effects of exposure to reshared content during the 2020 election. A random subset of 23,000 Facebook users had feeds without any reshared content for three months. Removing reshares significantly reduced the amount of political news, including content from untrustworthy sources, that users were exposed to. It also decreased overall clicks and reactions, as well as partisan news clicks. Similar to the first study, there were no changes in political polarization or individual-level political attitudes among users who saw no reshared content. However, these users did show a notable decrease in accurate news knowledge. Guess explains that despite the potential for reshared content to promote misinformation, more reshared content actually comes from trustworthy sources. Therefore, people are more informed overall.\n\nThe team has published these initial papers in Science and Nature, and they have at least 10 more in progress. Additionally, they are giving other academic researchers access to de-identified data from the studies so that they can explore their own research questions. END"}

Fox News and Huffington Post were chosen for their significance in the current political landscape and based on empirical web tracking data.\n\nThe researchers found that participants in the Huffington Post group visited approximately one additional page on the website per day, amounting to nearly 50 seconds of additional browsing time. On the other hand, the Fox News group visited nearly four more pages per day, equivalent to an additional two minutes. Prior to the study, participants spent an average of only 34 minutes per week on any news site.\n\nBy simply changing a default setting on participants' devices (the browser homepage), the study demonstrated the power of basic digital \"opt-ins\" in shaping people's information consumption. The researchers suggest that social platforms, public media, and other intermediaries can learn from these findings to promote authoritative and nonpartisan sources of information.

A series of new studies, conducted by interdisciplinary teams of political scientists and complex systems theorists, sheds light on the complex and ever-evolving nature of political polarization. These studies examine how polarization is influenced over time by the actions and interactions of individual voters, those in power, and various social networks.\n\nAs social interactions and individual decisions lead to the isolation of people into a few entrenched groups, the political system becomes incapable of addressing a wide range of issues or formulating diverse solutions necessary for effective governance and the provision of critical services for society. These studies were published in a special issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, resulting from a collaboration between Princeton University and Arizona State University (ASU). Several papers in this issue were led by researchers from Princeton.\n\nAccording to the introduction by the issue editors, the loss of diversity associated with polarization undermines cooperation and the ability of societies to provide public goods essential for a healthy society. The complex systems' perspective highlights that polarization is a dynamic process, best understood through complexity theory. Diversity maintenance is crucial for many systems to thrive and survive, as demonstrated by environmental and complexity scientists in other contexts.\n\nThe current polarization, both within and among nations, hinders efforts to address critical issues facing societies, particularly those related to the environment, such as climate change and the emergence of pandemic viruses like COVID-19. Simon Levin, the Director of the Center for Biocomplexity at Princeton's High Meadows Environmental Institute, explains that complex adaptive systems, present in various fields, allow scientists to understand the interactions that lead to specific structures and outcomes. This understanding enables more effective implementation of strategies to mitigate negative results.\n\nDespite the rise of partisanship, populism, and polarization, these phenomena have not been thoroughly studied as dynamic systems with multiple interacting components and large-scale features. Helen Milner, a professor at Princeton, emphasizes the need to explore polarization from a systems' perspective to better comprehend its causes and consequences for improved governance. The studies summarized below, conducted by Princeton researchers, delve into topics such as the impact of social media on partisan networks, models for successful electoral reforms, the influence of public opinion on political extremism, and the potential benefits of polarization under certain circumstances.

The research indicates that over time, swings in conservative public opinion exacerbate the self-reinforcement processes for Republican lawmakers. This means that when legislators respond to favorable public opinion, they further solidify their own positions. The researchers also identified a tipping point where polarization accelerates due to compounded driving forces and overwhelmed mitigating forces. They found that Republicans may have already passed this critical threshold, while Democrats are approaching it. Leonard expressed hope that the analytical tools developed for this study could help slow down the trend of polarization. \n\nFurthermore, a paper co-authored by Nolan McCarty and Joshua Plotkin highlights how intergroup conflict triggered by economic hardship can contribute to social and economic isolation, further worsening economic decline and political polarization. The findings suggest that implementing progressive taxation to ensure a sufficient social safety net could help prevent the economic anxieties that fuel ethnic and racial conflicts. McCarty stated that their research aims to understand the intricate dynamics that connect economic, social, and political changes, and to explore ways to break the negative cycle. END"}

A study conducted by Corina Tarnita, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and doctoral student Mari Kawakatsu at Princeton University, explored this issue. They were joined by Simon Levin, a distinguished professor in ecology and evolutionary biology, and Yphtach Lelkes, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nInspired by James Madison's essay \"Federalist No. 10,\" which emphasized the importance of diverse political interests in a republic, the researchers developed a model to analyze the impact of partisan interactions on societal cohesion. They discovered that when individuals care about a wide range of political issues, the fabric of society becomes stronger. However, under extreme partisanship, people become less willing to learn from those with different political ideologies. This results in increased tribalism, reduced interest diversity, and heightened polarization.\n\nFortunately, the researchers also found a positive aspect. The harmful effects of extreme partisanship only occur when individuals rely solely on their social peers to shape their opinions and strategies, while limiting their independent exploration. To maintain a cohesive society, the model suggests actively seeking knowledge beyond one's social network is crucial.\n\nMari Kawakatsu highlighted the need to study polarization in a multi-level context, as the complex dynamics of cooperation and polarization are not yet fully understood. The researchers believe that applying dynamic systems' theory, commonly used in engineering and biology, to democracy reforms such as ranked-choice voting and citizen redistricting could provide valuable insights.\n\nSam Wang, a professor of neuroscience and director of the Electoral Innovation Lab at Princeton, led an analysis that further supported this idea. He, along with a team of political scientists, proposed that using mathematical models based on systems' theory can help identify weaknesses in American democracy. By understanding the interactions that lead to polarized institutions, unresponsive representatives, and the manipulation of power by a minority, effective reforms can be designed.\n\nWang encouraged natural scientists to participate in the study of political phenomena by developing models, simulations, and interventions to improve the function of democracy. Just as engineers strive to understand complex systems in order to make repairs or improvements, the aim is to bring scholars from the natural sciences into the realm of politics and governance. Through a mathematically rich description of electoral mechanisms and their interactions, the impacts of proposed reforms can be maximized within the unique political contexts of individual states.

The researchers believe that this dynamic also applies to human political activity.\n\nThe researchers conducted experiments with golden shiners, a type of fish that associates the color yellow with a food reward. They trained groups of fish to swim towards a blue target, while smaller groups were trained to follow their natural inclination towards a yellow target. When the two groups were placed together, the stronger desire of the minority for the yellow target dominated the group's behavior. However, when fish with no prior training (the uninformed individuals) were introduced, they increasingly swam towards the majority-preferred blue target.\n\nThe researchers created models of animal groups to further explore this dynamic.

In situations where there are many uninformed individuals, the influence of a forceful minority wanes, and democratic consensus is achieved.\n\nThe study challenges our notion that being informed is always better and shows that uninformed individuals offer something valuable to group decision-making. It suggests that their ability to side with the numerical majority helps dilute the power of strong minority factions. This finding has implications not only for animal groups but also for markets and politics.\n\nDonald Saari, a professor of mathematics and economics, sees parallels between this research and work in markets and politics. He believes that highly informed experts often lose out to regular voters who base decisions on personal preferences and reasons rather than expertise. While a forceful minority can dominate in certain circumstances, their influence diminishes in more popular elections where less passionate people participate.\n\nThis study provides a new interpretation of group decision-making, contradicting previous opinions. It shows that a highly opinionated and forceful group does not always sway everyone. The uninformed individuals offer something different that contributes to achieving democratic consensus.

They focused on small schooling fish called golden shiners, known for their ability to evade predators through \"startle cascades.\" This behavior can be compared to a wave passing through a crowd at a soccer game.\n\nThe researchers discovered that the likelihood of a startle cascade occurring throughout the entire school of fish depends on their proximity to each other. When they bunch up closely in response to a threat, a startle from one fish is more likely to trigger a chain reaction among the group. It's similar to how if someone yells and startles you from a distance, you may not react, but if they're right next to you, you probably will.\n\nAvoiding predators and other threats is essential for an animal's survival. It's a crucial part of their overall fitness, which determines their ability to pass on their genes to future generations. Scientists have extensively studied how individual animals make decisions in risky situations, taking into account sensory inputs, previous experiences, and physiological states.\n\nSo, the next time you witness a group of birds or fish moving in perfect harmony, take a moment to appreciate the incredible collective computation happening among them.

It's truly a magical experience. And now, thanks to the work of researchers at Princeton University, we have a better understanding of how these flocks coordinate their movements.\n\nWorking alongside a team of Italian physicists, Professor Naomi Leonard and her colleagues discovered that starlings strike a perfect balance between responding to social cues from their neighbors and conserving energy. This balance is achieved by coordinating with their seven nearest neighbors. By doing so, they effortlessly form their characteristic flocks.\n\nBut this research goes beyond the study of animal movements. It has implications for the field of robotics as well. Engineers aim to emulate nature's efficiency in coordinating the activity of many individuals in uncertain environments, and this finding provides valuable insight into achieving that goal.\n\n\"In a flock of 1,200 birds, it's not possible for every bird to keep track of all the others,\" explains Professor Leonard. \"So, we asked ourselves, 'who is keeping track of whom?'\" The answer lies in the coordination between each bird and its seven closest neighbors.\n\nThe results of this study were published in the Journal of Public Library of Science-Computational Biology. The research team, which included graduate student George Young and physicists Luca Scardovi, Andrea Cavagna, and Irene Giardina, meticulously tracked and analyzed the movements of starling flocks.\n\nStarlings, a type of songbird, are known for their complex flock patterns. Each bird moves independently but must sense and react to the movements of nearby birds. Professor Leonard's research aims to understand how individuals contribute to the success of a group without a central leader.\n\nThe collaboration with Italian physicists Cavagna and Giardina, who had previously identified the significance of the number seven in starling flocks, allowed the Princeton team to gather detailed data. The physicists filmed starling flocks above a train station in Rome over the course of several years, capturing over 400 shots to determine the positions and speeds of each bird. This data, in turn, helped Young and Professor Leonard create a mathematical model to evaluate the synchronization and coordination within the flocks.\n\nThis study provides fascinating insights into the ways animals collaborate and communicate.

{"prompt":"video feature ‘flock logic’ collaboration unites science and dance by nick barberio on jan . 31 , 2011 , noon the unusual sight of dancers behaving like flocking birds recently in some of the indoor common spaces on the princeton campus was inspired by a collaboration between two princeton faculty members that merged science and art . a video of “flock logic , ” presents a profile of a project led by naomi leonard , princeton’s edwin s . wilsey professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , and susan marshall , director of the program in dance in princeton’s lewis center for the arts , that brings together the art of dance and the study of the way animal groups move together . the effort was born in october 2009 , when leonard discussed her research in a talk titled “flocks and fleets collective motion in nature and robotics” as part of the president’s lecture series . leonard’s talk described efforts by her and others to understand how bird flocks and fish schools move in patterns that seem highly choreographed , and then to apply these principles in designing robotic devices that work with unprecedented efficiency . in the audience was marshall , an internationally renowned artist who had recently joined the princeton faculty . after the lecture , leonard received an e-mail from marshall , who proposed that they combine their interests and explore some of these flocking ideas with dancers . the collaboration between leonard and marshall -- both recipients of macarthur foundation “genius grants” -- fit perfectly with the spirit of the princeton atelier , an academic program created by professor emeritus toni morrison to support professional artists who come to campus for intensive collaborative work with students and faculty . the beauty and complexity of animals in motion such as bird flocks and fish schools inspired leonard and marshall to create a class with dancers and students that culminated in two cross-disciplinary , cross-species performances . the performances , developed by students in the atelier course , were held dec . 5 and 6 in the icahn laboratory atrium and the rockefeller college common room , respectively . the basic rules of flocking -- the way biologists understand how animals stay together in a group and avoid colliding -- depend on cohesion and repulsion , according to leonard . by introducing dance and performance into leonard’s scientific theories about flocking , marshall aimed to explore how the rules of flocking might be put to artistic use and also possibly discover something about the ways in which people , as opposed to fish , sense and respond to others in a group . leonard’s work closely examines the mathematical rules associated with sensing and dynamic response that govern the movements of individuals in a group . “the understanding about this collective motion that you see in animal groups emerges not from a prescribed choreography and not from even a designated leader in the group , but rather from these simple rules of response that each individual in the group obeys , ” she said . when the atelier class was just the spark of an idea , sophomore willa chen , a dancer and computer programmer , worked with the two professors to create an online simulation program that would later help shape the class . with this simulator , chen could program rules of flocking that would inspire choreographic movement , such as maintaining distance between dancers and avoiding obstacles . according to marshall , performances based on principles such as those found in animal flocking are not unusual . “in dance , we have something called structured improvisation , which is a compositional approach in which people agree on rules , ” she said . “they’re often very complicated dance rules and instructions … and yet the specific outcome of the dance is unknown . ” the “flock logic” performances , which included students , professional dancers and volunteers from across campus who were given training beforehand , appeared choreographed though they were simply following the rules of flocking as found in nature . the atelier course and the dance rehearsals and performance attracted a diverse group of people who were interested in dance , science or were simply curious and willing subjects . ultimately , the motivating factor for the professors was the desire to create an event that would engage a cross-section of the community in the collaborative exercise of flocking , one in which participants could experience movement as both science and art . ->","completion":" Join us in reliving the incredible fusion of science and art that took place on the Princeton campus. Inspired by the mesmerizing patterns of bird flocks and fish schools, two brilliant faculty members, Naomi Leonard and Susan Marshall, teamed up to create a groundbreaking project called \"Flock Logic.\" This collaboration brought together the beauty of dance and the study of animal group movement.\n\nIt all began in October 2009, when Professor Leonard shared her research on collective motion in nature and robotics. The talk caught the attention of Professor Marshall, a renowned artist who had recently joined Princeton's faculty. After the lecture, an email was sent, proposing a collaboration that would combine their interests and explore the fascinating concept of flocking with dancers.\n\nThe partnership between Leonard and Marshall, both recipients of the prestigious MacArthur Foundation \"genius grants,\" perfectly aligned with the spirit of the Princeton Atelier. This program, created by Professor Emeritus Toni Morrison, supports professional artists who come to campus for intensive collaborative work with students and faculty. Together, Leonard and Marshall designed a class that brought dancers and students together, culminating in two incredible performances.\n\nThe performances, held in the Icahn Laboratory atrium and the Rockefeller College common room, showcased the complexity and beauty of animals in motion. Students in the Atelier course developed these performances, guided by the basic rules of flocking, which biologists use to understand how animals stay together and avoid colliding. Leonard's scientific theories on flocking were enhanced by Marshall's introduction of dance and performance, exploring the artistic possibilities of these principles.\n\nLeonard's work revolves around the mathematical rules that govern the movements of individuals in a group. She explains that the collective motion seen in animal groups emerges from simple rules of response that each individual obeys, rather than a prescribed choreography or designated leader. To assist in shaping the class, sophomore Willa Chen, a dancer and computer programmer, created an online simulation program that inspired choreographic movement based on flocking rules.\n\nAccording to Marshall, performances based on principles like those found in animal flocking are not uncommon in dance. Structured improvisation, where participants agree on rules, but the specific outcome is unknown, is a common approach. The \"Flock Logic\" performances were no exception; they appeared choreographed, yet the dancers were simply following the rules of flocking found in nature.\n\nThe Atelier course and the dance rehearsals and performances attracted a diverse group of participants, including students, professional dancers, and enthusiastic volunteers from across campus. This collaborative exercise of flocking engaged the community, allowing participants to experience movement as both science and art.\n\nWe invite you to explore the inspiring world of \"Flock Logic,\" where science and dance intertwine to create a truly captivating experience.

As a journalist and CEO of Rappler, she fearlessly defends freedom of expression. Rappler has played a crucial role in critically examining Duterte's controversial anti-drug campaign, which has resulted in an alarming number of deaths and resembles a war against the country's own population.

The Macmillan Group at the Department of Chemistry has developed a way to identify the nearest neighbors of proteins on cell surfaces. This is like shining a metaphorical searchlight into a dark cave, revealing which proteins on a cell's surface interact with one another. Proteins play a vital role in our lives, influencing everything from our thoughts to our growth and the diseases we may develop. They communicate with their neighbors to carry out important functions. However, scientists previously struggled to determine which proteins were in proximity to one another, limiting their understanding of these essential protein-to-protein communications. \n\nThe µmap technology, created by a team of researchers from Princeton and Merck, uses a photocatalyst to mark proteins and their neighboring molecules on cell surfaces. This allows for precise mapping of the micro-environment. The applications of this technology are vast and could impact fields such as proteomics, genomics, and neuroscience. The potential for advancements in fundamental biology is so significant that David Macmillan, Princeton's distinguished university professor of chemistry, is eager to share the technology with scientists in other fields to see what they can discover.\n\nThe problem with current tagging technologies is not their ability to label proteins, but rather the difficulty in distinguishing between proteins that are far apart and those that are adjacent. This is crucial because molecules, proteins, and enzymes that communicate with each other are typically in proximity. The team developed a revolutionary approach that allows for labeling within a short distance, providing a clear understanding of the neighborhood. This has never been achieved before and is comparable to turning on a light switch and suddenly being able to see everything in biology.\n\nScientists from the Merck Exploratory Science Center believe that this technology has the potential to be a game-changer for both academic and industry labs worldwide. By understanding protein interactions within cellular micro-environments, researchers can make significant advancements in the field of biology.\n\nMacmillan's group focused on two categories of human cells for their investigation. The first group served as a control, consisting of proteins with known interactions, to demonstrate that µmap can capture these interactions. The second group was more intriguing, as it centered on proteins associated with the immune system's response to cancer cells. These proteins, called pd-l1 and pd-1, play a critical role in identifying and eliminating cancerous cells. Macmillan emphasizes the unique collaboration between biology and chemistry, as their respective expertise combined to tackle a problem that neither field could solve alone.\n\nThis innovative technology is opening up a world of possibilities in understanding protein interactions and developing new therapeutics. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach biology and could have a significant impact on improving human health. END"}

A beautiful garden located between Firestone Library and Nassau Street will be named after Betsey Stockton, a remarkable woman who started as a slave in the Maclean House but later became a missionary and played a significant role in the Princeton community. Additionally, the easternmost arch in East Pyne Hall will be named in honor of James Collins \"Jimmy\" Johnson, a former fugitive slave who worked on campus for over 60 years.\n\nBetsey Stockton's journey from slavery to freedom is truly inspiring. After gaining her freedom, she dedicated her life to serving others. She founded the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church and established the first school in Princeton for children of color. Her impact was so profound that her former students even presented her with a stained-glass window in the church. The garden named in her honor will not only be a place of beauty but also a space for reflection, benefiting both the town and the university community. It is especially fitting that this garden is associated with the library, where the Princeton and Slavery Project made many important discoveries.\n\nSimilarly, James Collins Johnson's contribution to Princeton cannot be overlooked. Despite being a fugitive slave, he worked diligently on campus for many years, first as a janitor and later as a vendor. His dedication and friendly nature earned him the title of \"the students' friend.\" When he passed away in 1902, alumni and students came together to purchase a headstone for him in Princeton Cemetery. The decision to name the arch in East Pyne Hall after him is a testament to his impact and the lasting impression he made on the Princeton community.\n\nThese recommendations were made by the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) committee on naming. Comprised of faculty, students, staff, and alumni, the committee was tasked with recognizing individuals who would bring a more diverse presence to the campus. Last year, the committee successfully recommended naming Morrison Hall and Arthur Lewis Auditorium. Additionally, a reception will be held to celebrate the dedication of Lewis Auditorium, named after esteemed Nobel laureate and Princeton professor Sir Arthur Lewis.\n\nThe recognition of Betsey Stockton and James Collins Johnson is a significant step in acknowledging the historical ties of early Princeton trustees, faculty, and students to the institution of slavery. Their stories and contributions have been brought to light by the Princeton and Slavery Project, an important initiative undertaken by Princeton scholars and students. Stockton's journey from slavery to missionary work and education, as well as Johnson's lasting impact on the university community, are now recognized and celebrated.\n\nThese decisions are a positive move towards inclusivity and paying homage to individuals who have made a difference.

The installation features a beautiful carillon, a musical instrument consisting of spiraling bronze bells that will play the patriotic melody of \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" from a height of over 22 feet.\n\nThe inspiration behind \"Let Freedom Ring\" comes from the iconic 1939 performance of \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" by black opera singer Marian Anderson at the Lincoln Memorial. This performance represented a story of unity and democracy, as Anderson overcame adversity to share her incredible talent. Paul Ramírez Jonas pays homage to this moment by inviting the public to complete the song themselves. By pulling a lever, participants will trigger a 600-pound bell inscribed with \"Let Freedom Ring\" to strike the final note of the song. It will be a powerful and immersive experience that both you can hear and feel.\n\nThis incredible initiative, known as \"Pulling Together,\" is the first exhibition of the Beyond Granite initiative, which aims to make the National Mall a more inclusive space. The exhibition features six projects by talented artists, including Derrick Adams, Tiffany Chung, Ashon T. Crawley, Vanessa German, and Wendy Red Star. Together, they explore stories that have been untold on the National Mall.\n\nWe want everyone to feel welcome and participate in the installation. Located near the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, the installation will be visible to over 60,000 people daily. As you pass by on the overpass above the 12th Street Expressway, accessible from the Smithsonian metro stop, we invite you to complete \"America\" and be a part of this ever-changing country's story.\n\nThe design of \"Let Freedom Ring\" is a beautiful blend of tradition and creativity. Consisting of gothic arch-like steel beams, it supports a vertical pillar holding 32 small bronze bells arranged in a spiral, with a larger bell anchored to the ground. The form of the installation was influenced by the physics of suspending heavy bells and the need to adhere to safety requirements. It even references church bell towers, which adds to its timeless charm.\n\nAt the heart of this installation is the belief in the power of promises and commitments. By engaging the public and encouraging reflection and personal connections, \"Let Freedom Ring\" aims to build trust and bring people together. We hope you'll join us in experiencing this extraordinary display and become a part of its powerful message.\n\n\"Let Freedom Ring\" is made possible by the Mellon Foundation and is co-curated by Paul Farber, director of Monument Lab, and Salamishah Tillet, a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor. Together, they are reshaping the narrative of the National Mall and challenging the lack of diversity in its current monuments.\n\nCome and be a part of history as we build a more inclusive and meaningful commemorative landscape together. Let freedom ring, and let your voice be heard. END"}

Located at the end of platform 1 in the bustling Birmingham New Street train station, there's a hidden locked door that often goes unnoticed in the daily chaos of commuters. But starting from May 28, something exciting is about to happen.\n\nRenowned artist Paul Ramírez Jonas, chair of the Department of Art in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning, has designed a special key that will unlock this mysterious door. This key will take thousands of residents and visitors on a magical underground journey, reminiscent of Harry Potter, to a service tunnel adorned with vibrant green ferns and fluorescent lights.\n\nBut that's not all! This project, called \"Key to the City 2022,\" includes over 20 accessible spaces, both public and private, such as mosques, museums, restaurants, and even a private garden. These spaces come together to showcase the diverse and sprawling nature of our industrial city. They also raise important questions about public spaces, trust, fear, and the role of civic monuments.\n\nRamírez Jonas explains, \"We take a symbolic key to the city and actually use it to open places that represent the city. Instead of it being limited to a privileged few, now anyone can give the key to whomever they want, for any reason they want.\"\n\nThis project holds great significance in Birmingham, where the honorary \"freedom of the city\" has only been awarded to a select few individuals and military units. Now, a booth at Birmingham New Street station will invite visitors to present this honor, in the form of a key, to someone they admire or even a complete stranger. The ceremonies will be formal and prestigious, with participants crossing red carpets to a pedestal, stating their awardee and reasons, and having their names recorded in the city archives.\n\nIn New York, where 19,000 keys to the city were given out during a temporary transfer of authority, these ceremonies were incredibly moving. Ramírez Jonas hopes to recreate that emotional exchange in Birmingham, with up to 15,000 participants receiving a beautiful Yale key engraved with a hand offering a key on one side, and a detail from the city's coat of arms on the other. Each participant will also receive a passport cataloging all the participating sites in the project.\n\nWith their key in hand, participants will have extraordinary experiences. They can visit an office tower for a breathtaking bird's-eye view of the city, open a cabinet in a geology museum, or step through a hidden door in the 230-year-old bridge at the city's edge. An Indian restaurant will share its chef's special menu of his mother's recipes, while a mosque will warmly welcome guests to observe prayers. The key will also unlock doors to a sports stadium, a shopping mall, and even a private family garden.\n\nRamírez Jonas believes that this project is about more than just monuments. It's about fostering deeper connections and ownership of civic symbols. He wonders, \"Shouldn't we take pride in our symbols of community? They become meaningful when we have a real sense of ownership and participation. By allowing people to engage with this civic symbol, they also regain ownership of it.\"\n\nSo, get ready to embark on a remarkable journey through the \"Key to the City 2022\" public art project. Open doors, explore hidden gems, and rediscover the true soul of our beloved city. The key is in your hands, and the possibilities are endless! END"}

The mural, located in the Dryden Road garage, shows her grandmothers surrounded by nature and animals, with smiles on their faces. Abuova believes that the mural brings comfort to her parents, as they can feel that their mothers are watching over her and are happy in heaven.\n\nAbuova's mural is one of 13 in the garage, including three others by Cornell students. She collaborated with Paul Ramírez Jonas, a professor of art, and Caleb Thomas, the founder of Ithaca Murals, an organization that helps artists turn walls into works of art. Thomas believes that murals bring humanity to otherwise blank walls and reflect the diverse and beautiful people who live in the city.\n\nAbuova's motivation for creating the mural stems from her personal experiences of witnessing her parents struggle with the loss of their own parents. Her grandmother passed away from COVID-19 when the hospital couldn't provide a replacement breathing tube, and her mother couldn't make it back to Kazakhstan in time to be with her other grandmother, who battled Alzheimer's disease. Abuova believes that her family didn't get the closure they needed from these experiences.\n\nWith aspirations of becoming a professional artist, Abuova saw the mural as an opportunity to explore this art form. She wanted to create a memorial that many people could relate to, considering the challenging times of the pandemic. After reaching out to Thomas, she sketched a design based on photographs and collaborated on finding the perfect location in the Dryden Road garage.\n\nAbuova started working on the mural as an independent study project during the fall semester, with Ramírez Jonas as her advisor. This experience stretched her as an artist since she typically works in a studio with oil paints on smaller canvases. Working on a larger scale and using exterior house paint presented new challenges, but she persevered and learned valuable lessons along the way.\n\nThe main intention behind Abuova's mural was to spread positivity. She wanted it to serve as a happy addition to the garage, while also acting as a memorial for her grandmothers. Additionally, she hopes that people who view the mural can connect with their own grandmothers and loved ones through the artwork. END"}

At Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana, you'll find a remarkable outdoor art installation called \"Columbus Columbia Colombo Colón.\" It's a thought-provoking display that connects places around the globe named after Christopher Columbus, urging us to reflect on our shared history.\n\nThis powerful installation, on view until November 28th, features 58 flagpoles adorned with texts that unveil narratives and reflections. While not all of these stories paint a flattering picture, they shed light on the colonial presence that has influenced North and South America and beyond. The installation was crafted by Jennifer Newsom and Tom Carruthers, talented faculty members from Cornell's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning.\n\nThrough \"Columbus Columbia Colombo Colón,\" we see how the name \"Columbus\" oscillates between being a thing and an action. Newsom explains that this installation makes it obvious that a deep-rooted colonial presence exists in the Americas and has left its mark on the entire world. Each of the 58 poles at Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana, bears inscriptions that connect to places named after Christopher Columbus.\n\nNewsom goes on to emphasize that this installation represents the various ways in which we grapple with historical trajectories that continue to shape our present. These poles serve as poignant reminders of the current place names that shape our landscape.\n\nColumbus, Indiana, located between Indianapolis and Lexington, Kentucky, is renowned for its vibrant architectural and artistic scene. The city boasts buildings designed by legendary architects such as I.M. Pei, Gunnar Bikerts, Robert Venturi, and more. Carruthers and Newsom, principals of the architectural firm Dream The Combine, were awarded the prestigious J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize in 2021. With this honor came the opportunity to design a public art piece, which led to the creation of this extraordinary installation.\n\nThe name \"Columbus\" holds profound significance for the civic environment of Columbus, Indiana, and serves as a metaphorical thread that weaves together various aspects of life. Carruthers marvels at how the name \"Columbus\" has become synonymous with so many things, ranging from a crater on Mars to a sculpture, movie, or even a sausage company. It begs the question: What does \"Columbus\" truly mean?\n\nOne example of the installation's depth is the District of Columbia pole, featuring a poem by Phillis Wheatley, a renowned enslaved poet from West Africa during the Revolutionary War era. Wheatley's work first connected the female embodiment of \"Columbia\" to the United States. These 58 flagpoles create a mesmerizing spiral of stories, counterpoints, and metaphors, enticing readers to embark on a captivating journey through the installation.\n\nCarruthers describes the experience as a choreographed, performative aspect that induces a captivating reading movement. Visitors are encouraged to step inside, immerse themselves in the texts, and explore. As you encounter the Columbus, Georgia pole, you'll learn about Horace King, a talented black enslaved architect and engineer who overcame immense obstacles to build the first bridge across the Chattahoochee River in 1833. Despite the social limitations and racial prejudice of his time, King's life transcended these challenges and left a lasting legacy.\n\nSo come and experience the awe-inspiring \"Columbus Columbia Colombo Colón\" installation. Let these stories and reflections spark contemplation, deepening our understanding of our shared history and the complexities of our world. END"}

They envisioned a space where people could find respite during their lunch breaks, surrounded by art installations, comfortable benches, and a breathtaking view. Using the Unity game engine, which they learned during the course, the team created a captivating virtual reality demonstration showcasing the different phases of their project. This immersive experience allowed stakeholders to better understand how their intervention could truly transform the urban environment for pedestrians.\n\nMeanwhile, the Flatiron\/23rd Street Partnership focused on blending technology and art to illuminate historic buildings along the Broadway corridor. By using AR on smartphones, they aimed to attract more foot traffic to local restaurants and shops, while also highlighting the architectural beauty of the area. Their innovative approach aimed to create a vibrant atmosphere, promote local businesses, and ensure pedestrian safety.\n\nA strategic approach was taken by the Village Alliance team, whose mission was to empower community members along the University Place corridor. Instead of simply asking people what they wanted, this team sought to provide resources for self-organized projects that would benefit the community. They developed a gamified mobile application called the \"Village Alliance App.\" This app allows individuals to crowdfund pop-up projects, provide personalized reviews for street infrastructure, and connect with other visitors, businesses, and local authorities. By giving the community the tools to take ownership, the team aimed to foster active engagement and create a vibrant, thriving neighborhood.\n\nLastly, in the heart of Downtown Brooklyn, another team noticed the area's revitalization as new residents moved in. To celebrate this renaissance, they created a wayfinding application called \"Midday in Brooklyn.\" This app utilizes AR to showcase the history, present, and future of the borough. Through this engaging and informative experience, users can delve into Brooklyn's rich heritage, gain insights into its current offerings, and catch a glimpse of its exciting future.\n\nIndeed, the field of urban design is ever-evolving, and technology plays a crucial role in its adaptation. Tools like VR\/AR, 3D modeling and printing, as well as simulations of light, temperature, and sound, have the power to revolutionize the way we plan and design our environments. As Sharon Yavo Ayalon aptly states, \"These advanced tools, combined with platforms like Unity, enable us to create better-balanced and more sustainable spaces.\"\n\nThe efforts of these determined students and their faculty mentors are a testament to the power of technology in recapturing the essence of humanity in urban design. Through their innovative ideas and immersive demonstrations, they have paved the way for a brighter, more inclusive, and harmonious cityscape.\n\nSource: \"NYC Urban Design Course: Technology Recaptures Humanity\" by Blaine Friedlander, May 27, 2021.

Today, engineers, architects, and urban planners face unprecedented challenges such as deteriorating infrastructure, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. On May 23rd, over 60 people gathered at the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning's studio space in New York City to explore how our built environments can help us meet these challenges head-on.\n\nThe workshop, called \"Rebuilding the Built Environment,\" was organized by Cornell's Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future and AAP NYC. Kieran Donaghy, the Atkinson Center's faculty director of economic development, emphasized the need for physical, social, and economic resilience in our designs. Cities and infrastructure must adapt to changing patterns of settlement and production while preserving cultural and natural values, all while being economically sustainable.\n\nThe goal of the workshop was to bring together academics, design and engineering professionals, and civic leaders to rethink how we rebuild our environments. To make this a reality, Donaghy and Robert Balder, the Gensler Family Sesquicentennial Executive Director of AAP NYC, organized a day of collaboration focused on five key topics: best-practice engineering responses to climate change, large-scale developments that prioritize social equity and environmental integrity, government infrastructure policies, financing infrastructural investments, and identifying research opportunities and collaborative opportunities.\n\nEach panel discussion was moderated and allowed stakeholders and university partners to share programmatic needs, best practices, and opportunities for collaboration. Balder acknowledged that although there are ongoing efforts to study new technologies and institutional arrangements to respond to 21st-century threats, many communities still face a double threat of decaying infrastructure and climate change impacts due to lack of reinvestment, outdated zoning, and weak financial incentives for private sector investments.\n\nThe workshop showcased inspiring projects like BuroHappold Engineering's work on a vision for New Jersey's Gateway National Recreation Area, which includes the restoration and protection of Jamaica Bay and its surroundings. Participants were also excited to learn about Rethink Studio's plan for a fully renovated Pennsylvania Station with an expanded regional rail network. Another notable project was a collaboration among Jonathan Rose Co., Handel Architects, and New York City's Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development on a new mixed-use development in East Harlem that will provide affordable housing and become one of the largest \"passive house\" projects in the world.\n\nBalder emphasized the opportunity we have to create infrastructure and communities that not only meet current needs but also serve our social, environmental, and economic needs in the future. He hopes that workshop participants will continue the dialogue and remain committed to implementing long-term solutions.\n\nCornell University is at the forefront of fostering connections and conducting world-class academic research that directly impacts people's lives.

This groundbreaking technology, known as Tree Folio NYC, has the potential to revolutionize strategies for combating extreme heat in cities experiencing record-breaking temperatures.\n\nTree Folio NYC creates a detailed, three-dimensional model of the city's urban canopy, showcasing the location, type, and size of each tree. It also takes into account local conditions such as street orientation, width, and building height to simulate the trees' shading benefits. This in-depth understanding of tree placement can help city planners strategically plant and maintain trees to maximize climate benefits and ensure equal distribution.\n\nAccording to Alex Kobald, the project lead and associate director of the Design Across Scales Lab in the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, the aim is to explore the relationship between trees and their local environment, and how these conditions influence the benefits that trees provide.\n\nThe lab, led by J. Meejin Yoon, investigates challenges at the intersection of the built environment, ecology, and technology. The Tree Folio NYC project was developed in collaboration with students and funding from the Design Across Scales Lab and the Urban Tech Hub, part of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech.\n\nKobald has already shared early versions of the tool with municipal agencies and policy advocates. Furthermore, the open-source nature of the tool means that it can be scaled to other cities using publicly available data. This means that the benefits of this technology can extend beyond New York City.\n\nKobald emphasizes that extreme heat is a significant risk associated with climate change, especially for urban areas. Urban trees play a crucial role in combating the effects of extreme heat, making them vital infrastructure in cities around the world.\n\nThe Tree Folio NYC model was constructed using the most recent 2021 3D aerial scan of New York City, using lidar sensing technology. Through this method, the researchers were able to extract the urban forest from the survey and create an interactive map of trees. Each tree is represented by a cluster of green data points, resembling leaves.\n\nBy clicking on a tree, users can access information such as its address, species, health status, height, canopy radius, and trunk diameter. With the planned folio tool, users will also be able to compare trees of the same species in the same zip code.\n\nThe most remarkable feature of Tree Folio NYC is its ability to simulate the shade produced by each street tree throughout the year. This simulation allows users to see the extent to which a tree shades public ground or building facades, or whether it remains in shadow itself, providing no net cooling benefit. This feature becomes particularly useful when comparing neighborhoods with similar physical characteristics but varying street orientations, socioeconomic statuses, and heat vulnerability indexes.\n\nThe collaboration between the Design Across Scales Lab and the Urban Tech Hub has been instrumental in the development of Tree Folio NYC. The expertise of both teams in handling complex urban data and large-scale analysis has made this collaboration a resounding success.\n\nJ. Meejin Yoon emphasizes the importance of this collaboration in showcasing how open-source data sets can be utilized, analyzed, and expanded upon to create new tools that promote equitable and impactful climate mitigation strategies. Tree Folio NYC is just the beginning of what this collaboration can achieve in terms of creating a more sustainable and resilient urban environment. END"}

A recent national survey revealed that only about one-third of adults in the US believe that climate change affects certain groups more than others. In fact, nearly half of respondents felt that climate change impacts all groups equally. Even when race was mentioned in relation to climate impacts, only a small percentage of people believed that some groups are more adversely affected than others.\n\nThis misperception is concerning. As Jonathon Schuldt, an associate professor of communication, explains, previous research has shown that the American public misunderstands who is concerned about environmental issues. It is crucial to understand why this is the case.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2022 report clearly states that human-induced climate change has had widespread adverse impacts and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations and systems across sectors and regions. Schuldt and Pearson, co-authors of a study on the misperceptions of concerns about climate change and other global threats, analyzed data from two national surveys. They found that the majority of respondents believed climate change affects all groups equally or were unsure about its impact.\n\nInterestingly, Democrats and younger individuals were more likely to acknowledge the unequal impact of climate change. However, misperceptions still exist across all groups. It seems that there is a perception that climate change is a common threat that affects everyone equally, which may prevent people from recognizing or addressing the inequities at hand.\n\nOne surprising finding was that when the question included race, the belief that some groups are more affected than others weakened significantly. This is remarkable considering that race is a strong predictor of exposure to climate-related hazards. It suggests that drawing attention to the factors that put certain groups at risk might actually hinder progress.\n\nAddressing climate injustice and understanding public perceptions of it is crucial. Schuldt emphasizes the need for more in-depth research to track these perceptions over time and assess their impact on support for policies aimed at reducing climate inequities in the future. By shedding light on these issues, we can work towards a more equitable and sustainable future for all. END"}

Contrary to previous beliefs, it is not water that triggers explosive volcanoes, but rather gaseous carbon dioxide. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of volcanic hazards and can greatly improve our planning for future eruptions.\n\nTraditionally, geoscientists thought that shallow magma and water were responsible for driving volcanic eruptions. However, using innovative research tools developed at Cornell, scientists have found that basaltic volcanoes, typically located within tectonic plates, are actually fed by deep magma within the mantle, which is stored about 20 to 30 kilometers below the Earth's surface.\n\nThis new model provides us with a clearer picture of the Earth's internal dynamics and composition. The research, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, signifies a shift in our understanding of volcanic eruptions. Senior author Esteban Gazel, an esteemed professor at Cornell, explains that previous volcanic models were dominated by the idea that water was the primary driver of eruptions, but the reality is that carbon dioxide plays a much bigger role.\n\nThe breakthrough in this research was made possible by the development of a high-precision carbon dioxide densimeter and a device called Raman spectroscopy. By examining microscopic carbon dioxide bubbles trapped in crystals from volcanic eruptions, scientists were able to gain insight into the history of the magma. This new technique allows for near real-time estimations of magma storage, which was successfully tested during the 2021 eruption in La Palma, in the Canary Islands.\n\nThe scientists also developed methods to accurately assess the effect of laser heating on carbon dioxide inclusions within crystals and to measure melt inclusion and bubble volumes. These advancements are crucial for gaining a better understanding of volcanic processes and improving our ability to predict eruptions.\n\nUnderstanding the drivers of volcanic eruptions is essential for developing effective plans to mitigate volcanic hazards. Currently, the only way to observe these processes is through studying earthquakes, although they do not provide a complete picture. With precise measurements that reveal where eruptions start and how magma melts and is stored, we can develop more comprehensive strategies for future eruptions.\n\nThe research team, led by Esteban Gazel and Charlotte Devitre, collaborated with scientists from various institutions worldwide. The study, titled \"Oceanic Intraplate Explosive Eruptions Fed Directly from the Mantle,\" was also supported by funding from the National Science Foundation.\n\nThis groundbreaking research not only expands our knowledge of volcanic eruptions but also demonstrates the power of scientific innovation and collaboration. The findings provide valuable insights into Earth's natural processes and contribute to our ability to safeguard against volcanic hazards. END"}

As society's need for food and sustainable energy grows, researchers are considering a solution that can preserve agricultural land for crops and conservation areas for wildlife. Their idea is to install floating solar panels on lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. However, there are still many unknowns about how this innovative approach will affect aquatic ecosystems. Cornell University and the U.S. Geological Survey, led by ecologist Steve Grodsky and a team of multidisciplinary researchers, are embarking on a project to uncover these answers.\n\nIn a three-year endeavor funded by the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, Grodsky and a dedicated group of students has painstakingly connected 378 solar panels and 1,600 floats across three ponds at the Cornell Experimental Pond Facility. By studying these panel-topped water bodies, the team aims to discover how they impact both the living and non-living components of the ecosystem. They will investigate the effects on microorganisms, macroinvertebrates like snails and crayfish, aquatic plants, and fish. Additionally, the team will monitor greenhouse gas emissions, algae growth, bioacoustics, and even environmental DNA.\n\nGrodsky is joined by other esteemed Cornell scientists in this exciting venture. Meredith Holgerson, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, will contribute her expertise in carbon dioxide and methane emissions from ponds. Marian Schmidt, an assistant professor of microbiology, will study how the panels affect the microbial ecology in the ponds. Aaron Rice, a researcher at the K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, will investigate the impact on bioacoustics.\n\nThe research team has also formed a partnership with Ciel & Terre, a French company renowned for developing floating solar panels. With approximately 280 projects deployed worldwide, Ciel & Terre brings valuable experience to the table. Grodsky notes that interest in water-borne solar panels is increasing, and legislative support is also growing. Representatives Paul Tonko and Jared Huffman introduced the \"Protect our Waters and Expand Renewables on our Reservoirs Act\" last year, known as the \"Power our Reservoirs Act.\" This legislation aims to save land, reduce harmful algal blooms, and advance clean energy production by exploring the potential of floating solar panels on federal water reservoirs.\n\nBy incorporating scientific rigor and sustainability considerations from the outset, the project seeks to ensure that renewable energy development does not come at the expense of our ecosystems. As the world transitions to renewable energy, it is vital to understand and mitigate any unintended consequences. Grodsky emphasizes the need for responsible and informed decision-making to make floating solar panel deployment more sustainable.\n\nThe team, including postdoctoral researcher Nicholas Ray, master's student Tess Canino, and undergraduate student Jera Jansen, is currently examining the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide from the ponds. Benjamin Sterrett, manager of the Cornell Experimental Ponds, along with doctoral students Caitlin Davis and Tim Boycott, and undergraduate students Sheen Dwyer-McNulty and Dave Grodsky, have also played crucial roles in constructing the floating solar panel system.\n\nThis groundbreaking research not only holds promise for meeting our energy needs but also demonstrates that with the right approach, science can ensure a sustainable future for our planet.

These amazing creatures, no larger than a grain of rice, may hold the key to combating the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid, one of the biggest threats to hemlock populations.\n\nThe Cornell Botanic Gardens, in collaboration with Cornell's New York State Hemlock Initiative, recently released 700 silver flies in the Fall Creek South Natural Area. This release follows the introduction of beetles in that same area last year. By bringing both species together in this specific location, researchers are eager to understand if they can effectively fight the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid.\n\nThis aphid-like species feeds on hemlock branches, disrupting the tree's ability to transport vital nutrients to its canopy. If left unchecked, the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid has the potential to devastate the hemlock forests, including those in Fall Creek. These majestic trees, ranging from saplings to centuries-old giants, play a crucial role in maintaining the area's hydrology, temperature, and biodiversity.\n\nTodd Bittner, the Director of Natural Areas for Cornell Botanic Gardens, emphasizes the importance of hemlocks in preserving the ecosystem and supporting the diverse array of plants and animals that call it home. Their dense canopy provides a cool and shaded habitat for specific species to thrive. Additionally, their branching roots filter water, improve water quality, and prevent soil erosion. The shade they create also delays snow melt, ensuring a steady flow of water for trout and other fish.\n\nBoth the beetle, Laricobius nigrinus, and the silver fly, Leucotaraxis piniperda, are native to the American Northwest and are well-suited for colder climates. These predators naturally hunt Hemlock Woolly Adelgids, and their ability to reproduce twice a year ensures a continuous supply of food as the pest population grows.\n\nNick Dietschler, a research support specialist from the Hemlock Initiative, explains the potential of these predators and their specialization in targeting the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid. As these species have evolved together, they are likely to find the same niches on the East Coast as they do in their native habitat.\n\nTo protect the hemlock trees, the Cornell Botanic Gardens' natural area stewards have implemented insecticide applications to over 2,000 trees across 15 natural areas. However, in preparation for introducing biocontrol agents, some hemlocks have been intentionally left untreated. This strategic decision ensures a stable population of Hemlock Woolly Adelgids, providing ample food for the predator species to establish themselves successfully.\n\nThe short-term goal is for the predators to remain in Fall Creek for three years, indicating their successful establishment. The silver fly, known for its strong flying ability, is expected to spread and assist hemlocks in the surrounding areas over time. While pesticide applications typically last five to seven years, the team plans to reassess the area in 2024 to determine if further applications are necessary after the biocontrol agents have been released.\n\nThe long-term conservation plan for Fall Creek will heavily depend on several factors, such as the establishment of predator populations, the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid populations, and the overall condition of the trees. Despite the uncertainties, the mission to preserve as many hemlock trees as possible remains steadfast. Todd Bittner believes that even if there are hundreds of hemlocks left in the area a century from now, it will be considered a success.\n\nWith the combined efforts of researchers, the Cornell Botanic Gardens, and the natural area stewards, there is hope for the survival of the iconic hemlocks in Fall Creek and the restoration of balance to this vital ecosystem.

A researcher at Cornell University and her team have made a major breakthrough in plant productivity. By grafting key regions of highly efficient red algae into tobacco plants, they have successfully doubled plant growth. This amazing discovery has the potential to greatly increase carbon sequestration and improve our agricultural practices.\n\nThe focus of the study was on rubisco, the most abundant protein in all ecosystems. Rubisco plays a crucial role in photosynthesis by capturing carbon. However, it struggles to differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide, which limits plant growth and crop yield. This is where the red algae, Griffithsia monilis (GM), come in.\n\nGM contains rubisco that is 30% more efficient at fixing carbon than rubisco found in other organisms. Scientists have been trying to transfer this highly efficient rubisco into crops like rice, wheat, soybean, and tobacco for the past 20 years, but with little success. This is because rubisco requires specific \"chaperones\" to properly fold and function, and most of these chaperones in red algae are still unknown.\n\nHowever, in this recent study, the researchers were able to solve the 3D structure of GM rubisco and successfully graft certain regions into a bacterial rubisco. This bacterial rubisco, called rhodobacter sphaeroides (RS), closely resembles GM rubisco and can accept the grafted sequences without the need for special chaperones. As a result, the carboxylation rate (the speed at which rubisco begins the carbon fixation process) increased by 60%, carboxylation efficiency increased by 22%, and RS rubisco's ability to differentiate between carbon dioxide and oxygen improved by 7%.\n\nTo test their discovery, the team transplanted the bacterial mutant into tobacco plants. The result? Doubled photosynthesis and plant growth compared to tobacco plants with unaltered RS rubisco. Tobacco was chosen for this experiment due to its ease of manipulation. The goal is to develop a more efficient rubisco that can be transferred to other important crops.\n\nWhile the research is still in progress, this breakthrough is a step in the right direction. Even small improvements in rubisco performance can have massive impacts on plant growth and yield, leading to higher agricultural production, more efficient biofuel production, increased carbon sequestration, and even advancements in artificial energy possibilities.\n\nThis study was made possible with the support of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis, Formas Future Research Leaders, and the European Regional Development Fund. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the world of plant science! END"}

Hinestroza warns that if we continue at this rate, we will eventually run out of space to dispose of our textile waste. However, he believes that the solution lies within ourselves.\n\nYelin Ko, a doctoral student at Cornell, is working on a technique to repurpose polyester fabrics. By breaking down the fabric and extracting its monomers, she can create linkers that can then be assembled into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These MOFs can be used to create coatings on clothing that protect against germs and harmful gases, benefiting various industries such as firefighting. The chemistry behind this process involves the components naturally forming an ordered structure, known as self-assembly.\n\nThe team also believes that these new techniques can disrupt the unsustainable practices in the textile and apparel industry. By incorporating these MOFs into textiles, they can even help clean up polluted waters. Hinestroza, with his expertise in filtration and fiber science, aims to combine the new chemistry techniques with his previous research on capturing and decomposing harmful contaminants.\n\nIt's important to note that while these solutions offer hope for a cleaner future, it is crucial to address the waste and pollution already generated. It will not miraculously disappear, so it's our responsibility to take action. By harnessing the potential of polyester and implementing sustainable practices, we can work towards a healthier environment for ourselves and future generations. END"}

It was discovered that commercial bumblebee hives are posing a threat to their wild counterparts. However, this revelation has prompted one major pollination company to take swift action and adapt their bumblebee hive boxes to protect the wild queens.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology in February, revealed that the bright colors of commercial bumblebee nest boxes are attracting wild queens who are seeking to establish their own nests. Unfortunately, when these wild queens enter the commercial hives, the workers view them as invaders and kill them. This has led to the loss of valuable wild hives and pollinators in those areas.\n\nFortunately, the study also found a solution. By attaching a device known as an excluder to the nest box doorways, wild queens are prevented from entering the hives, with a 100% success rate. Plant Products, a North American subsidiary of Biobest, has already provided these excluders for all the hives they ship, along with clear instructions on how to use them. Additionally, the company has personally reached out to every client to explain the importance of the excluder, which creates a doorway too small for large queens but allows workers to pass.\n\nAccording to Dr. Heather Grab and Olivia Miller, the corresponding and first authors of the study respectively, the loss of each queen means the potential loss of an entire colony of bumblebees that provide crucial pollination services later in the season. On average, their data shows that about 10 queens are being killed per colony in the study region alone.\n\nInterestingly, the study also found that the use of commercial bumblebee colonies led to a decline in pollination services compared to areas where they were not used. This decline is believed to be caused by the loss of wild pollinators.\n\nThe excluders used to solve this problem were initially developed for a different purpose but proved to be incredibly useful in this situation. Originally designed to prevent commercial hive queens from escaping and mating with wild bees or spreading disease, they are now being used to keep wild bees out.\n\nOverall, this research has significant implications for the bumblebee industry. Bumblebees have been facing population declines across North America, so by saving queens early in the spring, we have the potential to combat some of these declines. The proactive measures taken by Plant Products and their quick adaptation to protect wild queens are an encouraging step towards positive change in the industry. END"}

However, its production comes at a cost: it contributes to over 8% of carbon emissions, which is almost four times more than the aviation industry. But now, thanks to the efforts of Greeshma Gadikota, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell, we have a plan to decarbonize the concrete industry.\n\nGadikota, along with her team, will be utilizing carbon dioxide-capture and mineralization technologies to produce low-carbon construction materials. This project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy through President Joe Biden's Clean Energy Plan, will receive $4 million in funding. Gadikota, who is also a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, will be leading this initiative as the project's principal investigator.\n\nConcrete production is notorious for its high carbon emissions, making it one of the most carbon-intensive products. Gadikota's goal is to reduce the carbon intensity of concrete production by at least 60%. If successful, this could decrease the global contribution of carbon dioxide from concrete production from 10% to just 4%, which is a significant reduction.\n\nWith the funding provided, Gadikota plans to build on her team's previous work in capturing carbon dioxide and converting it into solid products. Their expertise in this area has already produced construction materials that contain anthropogenic carbon dioxide. This project will further advance these integrated pathways for carbon capture and mineralization.\n\nThe Department of Energy has identified cement and concrete manufacturing as one of the key industries for decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. By addressing the copious amounts of heat required for concrete production and finding alternatives to coal and petcoke, which generate a significant amount of carbon dioxide, Gadikota's team aims to make a substantial impact.\n\nJoining Gadikota in this research project is Sriramya Nair, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, and a faculty fellow at Cornell Atkinson. Nair's expertise lies in developing and characterizing novel cementitious materials. The team will also collaborate with researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.\n\nAdditionally, industry partners such as concrete supplier Argos USA, steelmaker Nucor Corporation, and cement supplier Votorantim Cimentos North America are also involved in the project. With their expertise and resources, the team will be able to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the new technology at industrial conditions.\n\nOverall, this project represents a significant step toward decarbonizing the cement industry. The methods developed throughout this research will pave the way for full-scale implementation and commercialization of this new technology. Through collaboration and innovation, we have the opportunity to make a major positive impact on reducing carbon emissions in the concrete industry. END"}

Recent research conducted by Cornell University, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, and the University of Houston suggests that between 4,000 and 9,000 premature deaths and economic losses of $36 to $82 billion occur annually in the United States due to smoke particulates from wildfires. The study, titled \"Quantifying the Premature Mortality and Economic Loss from Wildfire-Induced PM2.5 in the Contiguous U.S.,\" was published in the Science of the Total Environment journal on June 1st.\n\nWhile we often attribute air pollution to sources like car exhaust and factory emissions, it's important to recognize the impact of natural sources such as wildfires. Climate change is contributing to extreme weather events like storms and hurricanes, as well as an increase in wildfires. For example, the Quebec wildfires in early June affected the health of people living hundreds of miles away in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington.\n\nWildfires release fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, which consists of organic compounds, aerosols, and metals that are less than 2.5 microns in size, even smaller than a human hair. These particles can enter our lungs and bloodstream, posing health risks. Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to PM2.5 from wildfires is linked to increased mortality and respiratory diseases.\n\nTo understand the impact of wildfire smoke on human health and economies, the researchers used satellite data on wildfire emissions and air quality from 2012 to 2014. Their updated model revealed that metropolitan regions located near fire sources, such as Los Angeles, Houston, and Atlanta, would bear a significant health burden and economic loss. For example, Los Angeles, which is downwind from fires in the western U.S., could experience 119 premature deaths and a financial burden of $1.07 billion annually. Similarly, Atlanta and Houston could see 76 and 65 premature deaths, respectively, with corresponding economic fallout.\n\nThe model also predicted that New York City, which was recently affected by the Quebec wildfire, would have 86 premature deaths and $780 million in economic costs resulting from similar events. California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina are likely to have the highest number of premature deaths due to the volume of particulate matter carried by the smoke.\n\nHowever, there are measures that can be taken to reduce the harmful effects of wildfires. Implementing laws and regulations, such as planned events to thin forests, can help mitigate the impacts. Creating green fire breaks and reducing fuel for fires in populated areas can substantially decrease the harm caused by downwind smoke. Local policies and guidance are also crucial in reducing wildfire risk and protecting people's health from exposure.\n\nThis study involved collaboration with other institutions, including the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Pusan National University, Ambri Inc., and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The research was funded by the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. END"}

With the federal government encouraging domestic manufacturing, policymakers are eager to reduce dependence on imports and create a more resilient battery supply chain.\n\nCurrently, the majority of EV batteries are manufactured overseas, but reshoring production could have a significant impact on the country's renewable energy transition and climate goals. The study, published in Science Advances on June 14, provides a comprehensive analysis of reshoring lithium-ion EV batteries, considering every stage of the life cycle from raw material acquisition to distribution and transportation.\n\nOne of the exciting findings is that reshoring could reduce the carbon footprint of US EV batteries and the energy required to produce them. By utilizing recycled aluminum and nickel, the carbon footprint of the pre-pandemic US electric vehicle fleet could be reduced by up to 26%. This highlights the power of data science and sustainability analytics in shaping future energy, climate, and manufacturing policies.\n\nAdditionally, the study explored the potential of an ally-shoring strategy, which involves reallocating production capacities to Japan, South Korea, and European Union countries. The findings revealed that increasing the shares of onshoring and allay production in the future US EV battery supply chain could further reduce the carbon footprint by up to 27% compared to the current configuration.\n\nFurthermore, integrating advancements in battery technology with supply chain restructuring could result in a remarkable 54% improvement in climate change mitigation benefits. By increasing the share of renewable energy in the power grid and reducing reliance on coal and lignite-fired electricity, the environmental sustainability of EV batteries could be significantly enhanced.\n\nIt's important to note that while reshoring offers benefits, there are also challenges to consider. Increasing overseas transportation distances for materials may lead to a decrease in some environmental performances. However, the overall positive impact on reducing ecotoxicity and fine particulate matter formation makes reshoring a promising step forward.\n\nOverall, this study underscores the significance of reshoring EV battery production for achieving our energy, climate, manufacturing, and environmental goals. By making informed policy decisions based on data science and sustainability analytics, we can shape a brighter, cleaner future for the United States. END"}

And now, new research from Cornell University suggests that the metaverse could even have positive environmental benefits, potentially reducing global surface temperatures by up to 0.02 degrees Celsius before the end of this century.\n\nThe study, titled \"Growing Metaverse Sector Can Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 10 GT CO2e in the United States by 2050,\" was published on June 14 in Energy and Environmental Science, with Ning Zhao, a doctoral student, as the lead author. The research team, led by Fengqi You, a professor in energy systems engineering, aimed to understand the potential of the metaverse from an energy and climate perspective.\n\nTo analyze the data accurately, the team used AI-based modeling to evaluate key sectors such as technology, energy, environment, and business. They specifically examined the impact of the metaverse's most promising applications, including remote work, virtual traveling, distance learning, gaming, and non-fungible tokens. By projecting the growth of the metaverse through 2050 along three different trajectories (slow, nominal, and fast), the researchers were able to gain insights into its potential adoption rate and energy consumption.\n\nSurprisingly, their modeling showed that the metaverse is expected to be adopted by more than 90% of the population within 30 years, growing much faster than anticipated. By drawing comparisons with previous technologies like television, the internet, and smartphones, the team recognized the explosive nature of technological advancements.\n\nCurrently, meta (formerly known as Facebook) and Microsoft are the major driving forces behind metaverse development, contributing to the study as well. While meta focuses on enhancing individual experiences, such as gaming, Microsoft specializes in business solutions like remote conferencing and distance learning. According to You, limiting business travel would yield the most significant environmental benefit. For instance, conferences that required long-distance journeys may become redundant with the advancement of virtual meetings in the metaverse.\n\nThe research paper highlights the potential environmental impact of the metaverse industry by 2050. It could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10 gigatons, lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by 4.0 parts per million, decrease effective radiative forcing by 0.035 watts per square meter, and lower total domestic energy consumption by 92 ej, surpassing the energy consumption of all end-use sectors in previous years.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the metaverse alone cannot solve all our environmental challenges. While it can certainly contribute in a meaningful way, we must utilize this technology responsibly and in combination with other initiatives. Ultimately, leveraging the metaverse reasonably could help lower global surface temperatures by up to 0.02 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe research was made possible with support from the National Science Foundation.

This is a crucial step in improving climate models to predict emissions from inland waterbodies, and it highlights the need for further research on small waterbodies. \n\n\"This study helps us understand what drives greenhouse gas concentrations and why some ponds have more variable concentrations,\" said Meredith Holgerson, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. She is also the senior author of the study. Previously, Holgerson and her colleagues estimated that shallow lakes and ponds may contribute about 5% of global methane emissions. However, without accurate measurements from many water bodies, this number could vary significantly. \n\nIt turns out that some lakes and ponds emit greenhouse gases in consistent amounts, while others are highly variable. Some ponds emit a lot, while others emit very little. Understanding these dynamics is crucial because carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Methane, in particular, is 25 times more potent at heat trapping than carbon dioxide. \n\nTo conduct the study, Holgerson and her collaborators at the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network designed the research and enlisted the help of 16 study co-authors across Europe and North America. These co-authors collected gas samples from a total of 30 small ponds and lakes, which were then analyzed. Each body of water was sampled three times in three locations over the summers of 2018 and 2019. \n\nOne key finding of the study was that the smaller the waterbody, the higher the emissions are likely to be. For carbon dioxide, samples were consistent throughout the waterbody, meaning researchers only needed to collect one sample to accurately predict the whole body of water. On the other hand, methane required samples from multiple locations to obtain accurate measurements. Shallow systems showed higher variability in methane emissions, suggesting that deeper water may prevent gases from rising to the surface. \n\nThe presence of plant life in the water influenced the variability of carbon dioxide emissions over time, while water depth played a bigger role in methane emissions. These findings lay the groundwork for informing strategies to mitigate climate change, such as building more ponds to help farmers cope with droughts in New York State. Researchers are now working to identify ways to minimize emissions through better pond construction and management techniques. \n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the impact of small lakes and ponds on climate predictions. By understanding and managing these waterbodies more effectively, we can make significant progress in mitigating climate change. END"}

Currently, vineyards are facing the potential for a reduced crop and economic loss. The freeze, which occurred between May 17-18, caused significant damage to the budding grapevines, as seen in the aftermath about a week later.\n\nTo further assess the damage and provide guidance, one of the experts, who is also a doctoral student in horticulture at Cornell, toured three freeze-damaged vineyards in the Finger Lakes region on May 26 alongside Richard A. Ball, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. This firsthand account will enable Ball to advise the governor, state legislators, and agricultural groups on the extent of the damage.\n\nAccording to weather data from Cornell's Northeast Regional Climate Center, the freezing temperatures occurred from midnight to dawn in the central Finger Lakes and Hudson Valley wine regions. The Keuka Lake area vineyards were hit the hardest, with approximately 50% of the vineyard acreage affected, while the damage varied in Seneca and Cayuga Lake vineyards. Damage was more severe going south toward the Finger Lakes, particularly in areas farther from Lake Ontario, which usually provides a heat buffer.\n\nExperts are also assessing the impact of the frost on other crops, including apples, blueberries, raspberries, and cherries. During a meeting with officials from the Farm Services Agency, efforts were discussed to obtain a federal-disaster designation. However, this process may take several months to over a year due to the necessary economic fact-finding and data collection. In the meantime, growers were advised to document the extent of the damage, take photographs, and map the affected fields in case crop insurance claims or disaster declarations are needed.\n\nGrapevine shoots, which contain leaves, tendrils, and tiny fruit, emerge from buds during the warmer spring days. Jason Londo, an associate professor at the School of Integrative Plant Science Horticulture at Cornell Agritech, explained that the shoots grow by swelling as water within the cells stretches them. Unfortunately, during a sudden cold snap, it becomes difficult to prevent the water-filled cells from freezing. Londo noted that the damage seems to be affecting the early cultivars, as those shoots were further along in their development.\n\nAlthough the last major spring freeze in New York's Lake Erie grape region occurred in 2012, protecting vineyards from frost remains an ongoing area of research. Londo emphasized that it's a challenging task, as there are limited methods to make plants resistant to freezing once they have filled cells with water. Frost timing and plant development vary each year, making it challenging to develop universal mitigation techniques for every freeze. However, researchers and experts continue to explore solutions to better protect vineyards in the future. END"}

The renowned \"Weeds of the Northeast\" guide, written by a team of researchers from Cornell University, has finally received a well-deserved update. Since its first publication in 1997, this comprehensive identification guide has become a staple for botanists, home gardeners, landscape managers, allergists, and even pest control specialists, helping them identify invasive plant species in the region.\n\nOne of the popular perennial weeds featured in the guide is the ground ivy, also known as creeping charlie, which is commonly found in turfgrass. With over 500 species included in the original edition, the book has been a tremendous success, selling nearly 100,000 copies over the last 25 years and ranking as one of the top sellers for Cornell University Press.\n\nHowever, times change, and so does the flora! In March, the press released a second edition of \"Weeds of the Northeast,\" which adds more than 200 new species that have slowly invaded the region, including waterhemp, Japanese stiltgrass, and garlic mustard. The new edition also addresses previously omitted weeds, apologizing to the wild parsnip for its previous exclusion. Additionally, the book updates terminology and expands its coverage to include more species from the mid-Atlantic states and upper Midwest.\n\nThe creation of this updated edition is truly remarkable, thanks to an extraordinary coincidence. It's a tale of two ditommasos, Richard Uva and Joseph Ditomaso! Richard Uva, the author of the original edition, collaborated with faculty members from the departments of horticulture and crop, soil, and atmospheric sciences to develop the manuscript. They reached out to a network of researchers throughout the northeast to gather suggestions and color images of various weeds, ensuring the guide's accuracy and usefulness in the field.\n\nChoosing which information to include in the book was no easy task. The team wanted to provide as much relevant information as possible while keeping the guide portable and user-friendly. Joseph Ditomaso, one of the team members, expressed his enthusiasm for including the wild parsnip, a common weed that surprisingly had not been mentioned in the first edition. It turns out that many others had noticed its absence too. The updated edition also features troublesome weeds like pigweed and lesser celandine, alongside familiar culprits such as swallowwort, kudzu, and common ragweed.\n\nWhile these weeds can certainly be a nuisance to gardeners, Ditomaso hopes that \"Weeds of the Northeast\" will also foster an appreciation for them. He even uses both editions of the book in his weed biology and management course, making it a fitting resource. As an undergraduate and graduate student, Ditomaso relied on the first edition, so seeing his own name in the updated version brings him great joy. He humorously shares, \"Now everybody I see here, it’s like, oh, yeah, this is my book. I’ve signed so many copies. Now I know what it feels like to be a star.\"\n\nWith the release of this updated edition, the \"Weeds of the Northeast\" guide continues to be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in identifying and managing invasive plant species. Its clear and comprehensive information, combined with the passion of the authors, ensures that it will remain a must-have for botanists, gardeners, and nature enthusiasts alike. END"}

This discovery has significant implications for tackling climate change and improving soil health for agriculture and food production. In fact, microbes are at least four times more crucial than any other process, including decomposition, when it comes to storing carbon in the soil.\n\nThis is valuable information because Earth's soils actually hold three times more carbon than the atmosphere, acting as a vital carbon sink in our fight against climate change. The study, titled \"Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency Promotes Global Soil Carbon Storage,\" was published in the scientific journal Nature on May 24. It presents a new approach to understanding soil carbon dynamics by combining a microbial computer model with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to analyze large amounts of data related to the carbon cycle.\n\nThe researchers specifically measured microbial carbon use efficiency, which tells us how many carbon microbes use for growth versus how much is used for metabolism. When carbon is used for growth, it becomes sequestered by microbes in cells and ultimately stored in the soil. On the other hand, when carbon is used for metabolism, it is released as carbon dioxide into the air, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, the growth of microbes is more important than their metabolism in determining the amount of carbon stored in the soil.\n\nProfessor Yiqi Luo, the senior author of the paper, emphasized the significance of their findings, stating, \"This work reveals that microbial carbon use efficiency is more important than any other factor in determining soil carbon storage.\" This insight directs agricultural researchers to study farming practices that can influence microbial carbon use efficiency, leading to improved soil health and greater food security. Additionally, future studies may explore ways to increase overall soil carbon sequestration by microbes and investigate how different types of microbes and substrates, such as those high in sugars, impact soil carbon storage.\n\nWhile soil carbon dynamics have been studied for centuries, this research is the first to evaluate the relative importance of microbial processes compared to other factors. The team achieved this breakthrough by integrating big data into an advanced computer model using data assimilation and machine learning techniques. The model revealed that the overall carbon use efficiency of microbe colonies is at least four times more important than other components, such as decomposition and carbon inputs. This new process-based model and machine learning approach open up possibilities for analyzing various types of big data sets.\n\nThe study was a collaboration between researchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, and Cornell University in the United States.

This allows visitors to explore and appreciate the beauty of this unique forest.\n\nThe university acquired the original 31.2-acre forest in 1997 after negotiating with the Cotton-Hanlon Lumber Company. This acquisition saved the ancient trees from being cut down. The forest was later named in honor of Richard B. Fischer, a beloved Cornell professor known for his passion for environmental protection. To create a buffer around the forest, Cornell purchased an adjoining 10 acres in 2000. Further expansions were made through generous donations in 2015 and 2017.\n\nWalking through this preserve is like stepping back in time. The trail starts near the remains of an old barn foundation, giving a glimpse into the area's history. As you venture deeper, you'll come across shrubs from past agricultural use and a young forest that was abandoned decades ago. Finally, you'll reach the mature old-growth forest with its remarkable 300-year-old trees.\n\nThis acquisition is not only about preserving the beauty and history of the area but also about protecting it from future challenges. With increased precipitation and extreme weather events, wetlands play a crucial role in flood protection. By managing and preserving the 25-acre wetland as a natural area, it will continue to provide flood protection for everyone downstream.\n\nCornell Botanic Gardens is dedicated to safeguarding and appreciating the natural wonders of this region. With the support of our partners and the community, we are excited to continue protecting and sharing the beauty and history of the Fischer Old-Growth Forest Natural Area for generations to come.

Sonnenberg, an esteemed professor of medicine and head of basic research in gastroenterology and hepatology at Weill Cornell Medicine, has received a generous grant of $3.26 million from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. This grant, awarded under the Method for Extending Research in Time (MERIT) program, will support Sonnenberg's investigation into the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n\"It is truly an honor to be recognized and nominated for a NIH MERIT award, and I am grateful for the opportunity to continue this important research with my laboratory over an extended period of time,\" said Sonnenberg. The MERIT program provides researchers with outstanding records of research accomplishment a five-year award, with the possibility of extending it for up to five more years without the need for another competitive review.\n\nSonnenberg's proposal builds on the groundbreaking research his laboratory has conducted over the past decade, studying key immune cell pathways in the intestine. One of the major mysteries in the field is understanding how tumor necrosis factor (TNF), an immune-derived factor, shifts from being beneficial to becoming a major driver of chronic inflammatory diseases. Sonnenberg and his team aim to uncover the answer to this question.\n\nCurrent therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD, often involve blocking TNF to reduce inflammation. However, these treatments are only effective in a subset of patients and can lose efficacy over time. Sonnenberg's team has discovered that gut inflammation induced by TNF is linked to the depletion of a specific class of cells called group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which are abundant in a healthy intestine. This finding led to the hypothesis that ILC3s play a crucial role in keeping TNF in check and preventing tissue inflammation.\n\nThrough a series of experiments, Sonnenberg and his laboratory will investigate the cellular and molecular signals that allow ILC3s to protect against TNF-induced inflammation. They will study this pathway in both mouse models and patient-based organoids, which are complex human cell culture systems that mimic the intestines of healthy individuals or those with IBD.\n\nIt is important to note that researchers cannot directly apply for MERIT grants. Sonnenberg and his laboratory initially applied for a standard \"R01\" grant from the NIH, which received a positive score after peer-review. Subsequently, the NIH program staff nominated their project for the MERIT award. Each year, NIAID awards approximately 15 new MERIT grants.\n\nThis new grant will further Sonnenberg's investigation and lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of IBD. Ultimately, it will pave the way for new therapeutic strategies to help individuals suffering from this challenging condition. END"}

This funding will support a groundbreaking study that focuses on comparing the benefits of two different heart procedures in underrepresented groups such as women, black, and Hispanic patients who suffer from coronary artery disease.\n\nCoronary artery disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States, occurs when the coronary arteries become narrow or blocked due to plaque buildup. Every year, over 1 million Americans undergo a procedure to restore normal blood flow to their hearts. One option is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a minimally invasive procedure that uses stents placed in the coronary artery through a small incision in the groin or wrist. This procedure requires minimal anesthesia, and patients can typically return home the same day.\n\nAnother option is coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), which is a more invasive procedure that involves opening the chest and may require the use of a heart-lung bypass machine. This surgery is performed under general anesthesia, and grafts are created using arteries or veins from the chest, arms, or legs to bypass the blocked coronary arteries. While CABG involves a longer hospital stay and recovery time, as well as higher rates of complications during surgery compared to PCI, it does offer longer-lasting benefits such as a reduced risk of heart attack and the need for additional interventions.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that more than half of the patients facing a decision between PCI and CABG are women or individuals from racial groups that have been underrepresented in previous clinical trials. This lack of representation has left these patients with limited guidance when making an informed decision.\n\nTo address this issue, Dr. Gaudino, who is also a cardiothoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian\/Weill Cornell Medical Center, will lead the Recharge (Revascularization Choices among Underrepresented Groups Evaluation) research program. This program will conduct two parallel clinical studies, Recharge Women and Recharge Minorities, with the goal of recruiting 600 participants at up to 60 study sites, primarily in the United States. Eligible patients, as determined by their local heart team, will be randomly assigned to receive either PCI or CABG. The trials will span over five years, following an 18-month feasibility phase.\n\nPrevious studies evaluating surgical options for coronary artery disease mainly focused on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attacks, strokes, and the need for repeat procedures. However, Dr. Gaudino and his colleagues discovered through focus groups that what matters most to patients when choosing between PCI and CABG is survival and quality of life.\n\n\"Patients care most about living longer and better,\" said Dr. Gaudino, who is also the director of the Joint Clinical Trials Office and the director of Translational and Clinical Research in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine. He will oversee the Recharge program, including study startup and patient recruitment strategies. Dr. Gregg Stone, the co-principal investigator, will be responsible for data collection and analysis.

In two separate publications, astronomers from the JWST's Early Release Science program have made exciting discoveries. They have detected hydrogen peroxide on Ganymede and sulfurous fumes on Io, both influenced by Jupiter's dominant presence.\n\nDr. Samantha Trumbo, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Astronomy at the College of Arts and Sciences, led the study on Ganymede. Their findings, published in Science Advances on July 21, reveal the presence of hydrogen peroxide at Ganymede's poles. By analyzing measurements captured by the JWST's near infrared spectrometer, the team observed light absorption caused by charged particles from Jupiter and Ganymede impacting the ice covering the moon. This interaction alters the surface chemistry of Ganymede's polar caps. Dr. Trumbo explains, \"This discovery shows for the first time that charged particles funneled along Ganymede's magnetic field are specifically affecting the surface chemistry of its poles.\"\n\nThe astronomers explain that the peroxide is produced when charged particles collide with the frozen water ice around the poles, breaking the water molecules into fragments. These fragments then recombine to form hydrogen peroxide. This process, known as radiolysis, is believed to occur primarily around the poles of Ganymede due to the moon's magnetic field, which directs charged particles towards those regions. Dr. Trumbo compares this phenomenon to Earth's magnetic field guiding charged particles from the sun to the highest latitudes, resulting in the aurora. Similarly, Ganymede's magnetic field influences charged particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, leading to aurorae on Ganymede and impacting its icy surface.\n\nDr. Trumbo and Prof. Michael Brown from the California Institute of Technology also previously studied hydrogen peroxide on Europa, another of Jupiter's moons. However, they found that the peroxide was detectable over a larger portion of Europa's surface, possibly because Europa lacks a magnetic field to shield its surface from fast-moving particles near Jupiter. Dr. Trumbo suggests that these observations of Ganymede offer valuable insights into how water radiolysis influences chemistry on icy bodies throughout the outer solar system, including neighboring Europa and Callisto.\n\nIn a second paper accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, JWST observations of Io unveil ongoing volcanic activity, including a brightening at a volcanic complex called Loki Patera and an exceptionally intense eruption at Kanehekili Fluctus. Io stands out as the only moon in the solar system with active volcanoes, thanks to the gravitational forces exerted by Jupiter. Studying Io's volcanic activity provides planetary scientists with unique perspectives that cannot be gained from studying Earth's volcanoes.\n\nLead author Prof. Imke de Pater, Professor Emerita of Astronomy and Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley, highlights the significance of these findings. She explains, \"This demonstrates that the James Webb Space Telescope can contribute valuable scientific knowledge about solar system objects, even when observing very bright objects like Jupiter or very faint objects near Jupiter.\" Prof. de Pater and Thierry Fouchet from the Paris Observatory serve as co-principal investigators for the Early Release Science Solar System Observation Team, one of the 13 teams granted early access to the telescope.\n\nOverall, the James Webb Space Telescope's remarkable capabilities are illuminating the mysteries of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede and Io. The sensitive infrared cameras and high-resolution spectrometer allow astronomers to explore the unique chemistry and volcanic activity of these celestial bodies, providing valuable insights into our understanding of the outer solar system.

By using data science and artificial intelligence tools, researchers were able to analyze court transcripts and uncover differences in how prosecutors questioned potential jurors based on their race and gender, with a focus on preventing women and black individuals from serving on juries.\n\nThis groundbreaking study utilized natural language processing (NLP) tools to examine the jury selection process. The researchers discovered clear and measurable disparities in how prosecutors questioned black and white individuals in the jury pool. This innovative technology, once validated, has the potential to provide evidence for appeals cases and even be used in real time during jury selection to ensure more diverse juries.\n\nProfessor Blume, an expert in the field, explained the significance of this advancement: \"NLP software allows us to examine whether prosecutors question black and white jurors differently in a more sophisticated manner than ever before. We can now analyze not only the quantity, but also the manner in which the questions are posed.\"\n\nProsecutors sometimes employ tactics to disqualify black and female jurors, assuming they may be more sympathetic to the defendant, especially if they share the same race. For instance, they may present a particularly gruesome description of the execution process and then ask potential jurors if they would be willing to sentence the defendant to death. If the answer is no, that person is struck from the jury pool.\n\nTo determine if NLP software could identify such biased questioning and other indicators, Professor Blume collaborated with Professor Wells to analyze transcripts from 17 capital cases in South Carolina. Their extensive dataset consisted of over 26,000 questions posed by judges, defense attorneys, and the prosecution to potential jurors. The researchers examined not only the number of questions asked to individuals based on race, gender, and ethnicity, but also the complexity of the questions, the topics covered, and the language used.\n\nProfessor Wells noted the consistent racial differences observed in various measures: \"When we conduct job interviews, we typically ask everyone the same set of questions. However, in jury selection, this is not the case.\" The analysis revealed significant disparities in the length, complexity, and sentiment of the questions asked by prosecutors to black potential jurors compared to white ones, indicating an intention to shape their responses. Importantly, there were no racial differences observed in the questions asked by judges and the defense.\n\nFurthermore, the study found evidence that prosecutors attempted to disqualify black potential jurors by delving into their views on the death penalty. Black potential jurors, especially those who were ultimately excused from serving, were subjected to more explicit and graphic questions about execution methods compared to their white counterparts.\n\nThese findings provide compelling evidence that NLP tools can successfully detect biased jury selection. Moving forward, the researchers hope to conduct similar studies on larger datasets encompassing a wider range of case types. Once the validity of this method is established, Professor Wells envisions it being used in real time during jury selection, stating, \"This could be done almost instantaneously, whether to monitor the process or provide evidence for an appeal.\" Ultimately, this groundbreaking software has the potential to be a powerful tool in diversifying juries, particularly for defendants facing the death penalty.

{"prompt":"creatively enhancing a cv , known as “resume padding , ” has the potential to cast the sender in a bad light . but can this “self-reported signaling” – the conveying of information that may or may not be true – ultimately have a positive effect in the grand scheme of things ? two cornell researchers think so . “if you wind up using resume padding to get a higher-level job that you’re not qualified for – and that job is really important , like the [u . s . rep . ] george santos case – that’s not a good thing , ” said michael waldman , the charles h . dyson professor of management in the samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management , in the cornell sc johnson college of business . but , waldman said , resume padding can ultimately have a positive effect – if the long-term result is decreased misrepresentation . waldman is co-author of “self-reported signaling , ” which published july 27 in american economic journal microeconomics . the other author is thomas jungbauer , assistant professor of strategy and business economics at johnson . the difference between the two concepts in spence’s world , the signal is always valid . in self-reported signaling , the signal can be a lie , as in the santos case . a cv is an example of self-reported signaling most of the information on it is not widely known , and the recipient expects it to be accurate and truthful . there are items that can be verified via investigation – education level , previous employment – and others that cannot , such as leadership qualities and work ethic . but verification is costly . in their modeling , the researchers considered a single sender ( job applicant ) and a pool of identical receivers ( hiring officers ) . the sender chooses an action ( education level ) that is not publicly known but can be verified , although at a potentially high cost in time and money . assumptions regarding the veracity of the resumes , the hiring officers’ willingness to verify the information , and the risk-benefit of dishonesty regarding education levels are factored into the model . their modeling uncovered two major results 1 . the possibility of resume padding reduces the return to investing in higher education levels . this is because , even if the claim of a higher education level is truthful , the possibility that it could be untruthful lowers the amount hiring officers are willing to pay and 2 . the subsequent reduction in investments in education can “undo” the overinvestment typically associated with signaling , thus increasing the “social welfare , ” as the researchers call it , of all senders . “there is the possibility , ” jungbauer said , “that all this misrepresentation just lowers the incentive of investing in the signal , whether it be education or other standard activities that serve as signals , which could have a positive effect on the economy . ” the researchers also applied this modeling to college admissions – particularly in the area of applicants’ self-reported extracurricular activities and leadership roles . their modeling and analysis revealed that the possibility of misrepresentation reduces overinvestment in these types of activities , and may actually increase overall social welfare . “we typically think of lying as being unambiguously bad , ” the authors wrote . “at the same time , however , we know that signaling results in distortions which serve to lower social welfare . if self-reports of actions serve as signals … there can be a social welfare benefit as the misrepresentation reduces the signaling distortion . ” waldman said the nonstop news regarding santos’ misrepresenting his past could trigger a lessening of that type of behavior . waldman and jungbauer are both affiliated with the field of economics at cornell , in addition to their primary appointments at johnson . ->","completion":" Enhancing your CV, also known as \"resume padding,\" can sometimes give a negative impression. However, there is a possibility that this \"self-reported signaling,\" which involves sharing information that may or may not be true, can actually have positive effects in the long run. Two researchers from Cornell University believe so.\n\nMichael Waldman, a professor at Cornell, acknowledges that using resume padding to secure a high-level job that you may not be qualified for, like the George Santos case, is not a good thing. However, Waldman suggests that resume padding can have a positive impact if it ultimately reduces misrepresentation. This insight comes from his co-authored research paper, \"Self-reported Signaling,\" published in the American Economic Journal Microeconomics, which also involved Thomas Jungbauer from Johnson College of Business.\n\nThe main difference between the concepts of signaling and self-reported signaling is that, in signaling, the information shared is always true, while in self-reported signaling, there is a possibility of dishonesty, as in the Santos case. A CV is an example of self-reported signaling because most of the information provided is not widely known, and the recipient expects it to be accurate. Some aspects of the CV, such as education and previous employment, can be verified, while others, like leadership qualities and work ethic, cannot be easily checked.\n\nIn their modeling, the researchers considered a scenario where there is a job applicant and a pool of hiring officers. The applicant has the choice to include information (such as education level) in their CV, which is not publicly known but can be verified at a cost. The researchers factored in assumptions about the truthfulness of the resumes, the willingness of hiring officers to verify information, and the risks and benefits of dishonesty regarding education levels.\n\nTheir modeling revealed two major findings. First, the possibility of resume padding reduces the value of investing in higher education because even a truthful claim of higher education may be doubted, leading to lower offers from hiring officers. Second, this reduction in investment in education can counterbalance the tendency of signaling to create an overinvestment, leading to increased social welfare for all job applicants.\n\nThe researchers also applied their modeling to college admissions, specifically in relation to applicants' self-reported extracurricular activities and leadership roles. They found that the possibility of misrepresentation reduces overinvestment in these activities and may actually increase overall social welfare.\n\nThe authors of the research paper acknowledged that lying is generally seen as negative. However, they argued that if self-reports serve as signals, misrepresentation can reduce distortions caused by signaling, resulting in a social welfare benefit.\n\nWaldman believes that the continuous media coverage of cases like Santos' could discourage such misrepresentations in the future. Both Waldman and Jungbauer are affiliated with the field of economics at Cornell and hold primary appointments at Johnson College of Business. END"}

This situation, known as \"load imbalance,\" was more likely to occur in hospitals that served a higher number of black patients and patients enrolled in Medicaid, according to a recent study conducted by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators.\n\nThe study, published on July 5 in Health Affairs, sheds light on the need for better coordination of patient transfers, which can help address overcapacity and ensure equal access to care. \"The research highlights the need for better coordination of patient transfers, which can alleviate overcapacity and ease inequities in care,\" said senior study author William L. Schpero, Assistant Professor of Population Health Sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n\nThis study is the first of its kind to closely examine the prevalence of load imbalance in hospitals during the pandemic and the specific hospitals that were affected, according to the study's lead author, Dr. Adam S. Vohra, an interventional cardiology fellow at Weill Cornell Medicine. The researchers analyzed data from 290 hospital referral regions (HRRs), which are geographic areas that define hospital markets. The data on hospital capacity came from the COVID-19 reported patient impact and hospital capacity files, produced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe study found that 154 HRRs, or 53.1% of the regions studied, experienced load imbalance between July 31, 2020, and March 4, 2022. Regions with the highest load imbalance had a higher proportion of black residents. Additionally, hospitals with a larger proportion of Medicaid patients and black Medicare patients were more likely to be overloaded while other hospitals had available capacity.\n\n\"We believe that our estimate of load imbalance is conservative, so it's possible that the actual prevalence is even higher,\" said Schpero. Some overwhelmed hospitals likely lacked sufficient staff, beds, or supplies to meet patient needs safely. \"While resources were available elsewhere, many states didn't have the infrastructure to address capacity constraints across hospitals and facilitate patient transfers,\" Schpero added. \n\nHowever, some states, such as Arizona, Minnesota, and Washington, have implemented centralized coordinating hubs to manage transfer requests during periods of high surge to alleviate the burden on overwhelmed hospitals. These systems rely on critical care or emergency department nurses and technicians to facilitate patient transfers. Although the study did not assess the causal effect of these coordinating hubs on outcomes, they hold promise in addressing this issue.\n\nFacilitating patient transfers between hospitals can be challenging, and an effective transfer system requires real-time data on patient needs and bed availability. Weekly reporting mechanisms are too slow to respond adequately. \"There needs to be an agreement among hospitals, either voluntary or mandated by state law, to share real-time data on hospital capacity and facilitate transfers,\" said Schpero.\n\nAs the urgency of the pandemic has decreased, now is the time to reflect on the lessons learned and invest in policies and practices that prioritize equitable patient care. \"Whether it's another pandemic or a natural disaster, we should never have to compromise on providing equal access to care,\" emphasized Schpero.

Cornell University Hospital for Animals has recently introduced a state-of-the-art service that can greatly benefit your furry companions. They have added a cutting-edge technology that can cleanse your pets' blood outside their bodies. This breakthrough opens up a world of new treatment options, including dialysis for animals with kidney failure and immune-mediated diseases.\n\nThe new technology, known as an Extracorporeal Blood Purification (EBP) unit, became available this spring for cats and dogs. It's worth noting that only about 35 other animal hospitals in the entire country have this capability, making Cornell's hospital the only one in the region. The closest facilities offering this advanced technology are located in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\nDr. Jethro Forbes, an assistant clinical professor in the section of emergency and critical care, expressed his excitement about this game-changing addition. He mentioned that being able to provide dialysis and other extracorporeal blood purification treatments to the patients in the upstate New York region is a significant step forward for their veterinary hospital. The EBP unit allows them to act as your pet's artificial kidneys for a few weeks, giving their resilient organs a chance to heal.\n\nWhile kidney dialysis is a common treatment for people, it hasn't been as prevalent in veterinary practices due to the extensive training required to operate the technology. However, the community of high-level practitioners in this field is rapidly growing, according to Dr. Forbes.\n\nThe EBP unit brings numerous benefits to the lives of animals. One of the most common uses is dialysis for pets suffering from kidney failure. This technology essentially cleanses the patient's blood of toxins, just as a real kidney would. For animals whose kidneys cannot function properly, being put on dialysis can make a life-saving difference.\n\nAnother essential application of the EBP unit is removing toxins or drugs from the bloodstream. Sometimes our pets accidentally ingest substances they shouldn't, like medications or chemicals. In these cases, the EBP unit can cleanse the blood of these harmful elements in just a few hours of treatment, preventing any damage to your beloved pet's organs.\n\nFurthermore, the technology can also assist in managing an animal's immune system through therapeutic plasma exchange. This therapy is particularly helpful for diseases like immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, where the immune system destroys the body's own red blood cells. With therapeutic plasma exchange, the dangerous elements of the malfunctioning immune system are removed, allowing medication to have a greater impact.\n\nThe possibilities for expanding the capabilities of the EBP unit are endless. They are considering configuring it for more species, such as horses, pigs, and goats. Additionally, by using different components, the unit could potentially clear a patient's blood of bacteria and viruses. In the future, this unit may even contribute to cutting-edge cancer therapies and bone marrow transplants.\n\nDr. Forbes expressed his excitement for what lies ahead, particularly with the potential to offer this treatment to a wider range of animals. Currently, they are thrilled to provide this advanced care for dogs and cats at Cornell while also training the next generation of veterinary specialists to offer these treatments to even more pets.\n\nOverall, this new technology at Cornell University Hospital for Animals offers hope and improved outcomes for companion animals in need of advanced medical care.

To answer this question, researchers decided to test AI models and humans using entries from The New Yorker magazine's cartoon caption contest. Three tasks were given: matching a joke to a cartoon, identifying a winning caption, and explaining why a winning caption is funny. In all three tasks, humans consistently outperformed machines, despite advancements in AI like ChatGPT that have closed the performance gap.\n\nAlthough machines are making progress, they haven't fully reached the point of \"understanding\" humor yet. Jack Hessel, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2), explains that testing AI models is done through multiple choice tests or other evaluations with an accuracy score. Even if a model surpasses human performance on these tests, it's debatable whether it truly understands humor since understanding is a human trait. Nonetheless, it's still remarkable how well machines perform on these tasks.\n\nFor the study, the researchers compiled over 700 captions contests from The New Yorker spanning 14 years. Each contest included a cartoon without a caption, the entries for that week, the three finalists selected by New Yorker editors, and crowd quality estimates for some contests. The researchers tested two types of AI models for the three tasks: \"from pixels\" (computer vision) and \"from description\" (analysis of human summaries of cartoons).\n\nThe unique aspect of The New Yorker's cartoons is that the relationship between the images and the captions is indirect, playful, and often references real-world entities and norms. This requires a higher level of sophistication in understanding the relationship between these elements. In the experiment, the matching task involved AI models selecting the finalist caption for a given cartoon from various distractions that were finalists in different contests. The quality ranking task required models to differentiate between a finalist caption and a non-finalist one. Lastly, for the explanation task, models had to generate free text explaining how a high-quality caption connects to the cartoon. Hessel was primarily responsible for writing the explanations himself after crowdsourcing proved unsatisfactory. He created 60-word explanations for over 650 cartoons, which may not seem like a large dataset in the context of machine learning, but it was a substantial effort.\n\nAlthough AI may not completely grasp humor yet, the authors of the study believe it could serve as a collaborative tool for humorists to brainstorm ideas.

The Cornell Botanic Gardens and the New York State Hemlock Initiative have released 700 silver flies in the Fall Creek South natural area in June. In 2022, they plan to release a beetle as well. The hope is that these insects will provide a long-term biological solution to the hemlock woolly adelgid, which is a major threat to hemlock populations.\n\nWhile both species have been released separately in the past, this is the first time they will exist together in Fall Creek South, which gives researchers valuable insights into whether they can effectively combat the hemlock woolly adelgid. Hemlocks play a crucial role in the local ecosystem. Their dense canopy provides a cool and shaded habitat for specific plants and animals to thrive. The tree's roots also filter water and prevent soil erosion, improving water quality. Additionally, the shade from hemlocks delays snow melt in the spring, ensuring sufficient stream-flows for trout and other fish.\n\nThe beetle, known as laricobius nigrinus, and the silver fly, called leucotaraxis piniperda, are both native to the American Northwest and naturally adapted to colder climates. They prey on adelgids and reproduce twice a year, allowing them to feed on hemlock woolly adelgids as they reproduce. Researchers are studying the niche specialization between these two predator species, as they have co-evolved with each other and are likely to find similar niches on the East Coast as in their native Northwest.\n\nTo protect hemlocks in Fall Creek, the natural area stewards at Cornell Botanic Gardens have treated over 2,000 trees with insecticides. However, they have strategically left some trees untreated in preparation for the introduction of biocontrol agents. These untreated trees will help maintain stable populations of hemlock woolly adelgids, providing a steady supply of food for the predator populations to establish themselves. The short-term goal is for the predators to remain in the area for three years, demonstrating their successful establishment.\n\nIn the future, researchers hope that the silver fly, which is a strong flier, will spread and assist hemlocks in the surrounding area. As the effects of pesticide applications usually last for five to seven years, many trees in Fall Creek will require reapplication of insecticides within the next few years. The team plans to reassess the area in 2024 to determine if pesticides are still necessary after the biocontrol agents have been released and allowed time to establish their presence.\n\nThe long-term conservation plan for Fall Creek depends on factors such as the establishment of the predator populations, the status of hemlock woolly adelgid populations, and the condition of the trees. Despite uncertainties, the mission remains clear: to conserve as many hemlock trees as possible. As Bittner, one of the researchers, says, \"If, in 100 years, we have hundreds of hemlocks in this area, that's a success.\" END"}

They successfully transferred important components from a highly efficient red algae into a tobacco plant with the help of bacteria. This exciting study, co-authored by Laura Gunn, an assistant professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science, Plant Biology Section, was featured on the cover of the June 8 issue of Nature Plants.\n\nThe focus of the study was on a protein called rubisco, which plays a vital role in photosynthesis and can be found in various organisms, including plants, algae, and bacteria. Rubisco has some limitations, such as being slow and struggling to differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide. This often hinders plant growth and crop yield. However, a specific type of red algae called Griffithsia monilis (GM) has a highly efficient rubisco that is 30% better at fixing carbon than rubisco found in other organisms, including crops like rice, wheat, soybean, and tobacco.\n\nScientists have been interested in introducing this efficient GM rubisco into plants for over 20 years, but until now, they have been unable to do so successfully. The reason is that rubisco requires multiple \"chaperones\" to function properly, and many of these chaperones in red algae are still unknown. However, Gunn and her co-authors were able to solve the structure of GM rubisco and use this information to graft certain regions from a bacterial rubisco called Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RS rubisco) into it.\n\nRS rubisco, although not very efficient, is closely related to GM rubisco, making it compatible with the grafted sequences. It also doesn't need specific chaperones to fold and assemble in plants. This change significantly increased the speed and efficiency of the carbon fixation process, as well as improved the ability to differentiate between carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the researchers transplanted this modified bacterial rubisco into tobacco plants, they observed a doubling of photosynthesis and plant growth compared to unaltered RS rubisco.\n\nTobacco was chosen for this experiment because it is easier to manipulate rubisco in this plant. The researchers are using it as a test case to develop a more efficient rubisco that can be transferred to other economically important crops. Although they haven't surpassed the performance of wild-type tobacco yet, they are heading in the right direction. Even small improvements in rubisco performance can have a significant impact on plant growth and yield over a growing season, which can benefit various sectors such as agriculture, biofuel production, carbon sequestration, and artificial energy possibilities.\n\nThis research was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis, Formas Future Research Leaders, and the European Regional Development Fund.

This comprehensive study in healthy adults provides the strongest evidence to date of the link between omega-3 fatty acids and lung health. The researchers emphasize the importance of including omega-3 fatty acids in our diets, especially considering that many Americans do not meet the recommended guidelines.\n\nWhile we already know a lot about the impact of diet on cancer and cardiovascular diseases, the role of diet in chronic lung disease has been somewhat overlooked, says Patricia A. Cassano, the Alan D. Mathios Professor in the College of Human Ecology and Director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences. This study adds to the growing evidence that omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for a healthy diet, may also be important for maintaining lung health.\n\nThere is a growing interest in exploring if nutritional interventions can help prevent lung disease, according to the researchers. Previous studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial, primarily due to their anti-inflammatory properties, but robust studies on this association have been lacking. To address this gap, the researchers conducted a two-part study to investigate the relationship between omega-3 fatty acid levels in the blood and lung function over time.\n\nIn the first part of the study, the researchers conducted a longitudinal, observational study involving more than 15,000 diverse Americans from the NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study, which is a collection of NIH-funded studies focusing on personalized risk for chronic lung disease. This study showed that individuals with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood experienced a reduced rate of lung function decline. The strongest associations were observed for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and sardines. DHA is also available as a dietary supplement.\n\nIn the second part of the study, the researchers analyzed genetic data from over 500,000 participants of European descent from the UK Biobank. They examined specific genetic markers in the blood as an indirect measure of dietary omega-3 fatty acid levels and their correlation with lung health. The results showed that higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, were associated with better lung function.\n\nIt's important to note that this study only included healthy adults. As part of the ongoing project, the researchers are collaborating with the COPDGene study to investigate blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids in relation to the rate of lung function decline in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including heavy smokers. This will help determine if the same beneficial associations apply to these individuals.\n\n\"We are starting to make strides in nutritional research and moving towards personalized nutrition for treating lung diseases,\" says Patchen, a researcher involved in the project. \"In the future, this could lead to tailored dietary recommendations for individuals at high risk for chronic lung disease.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's \"Dietary Guidelines for Americans\" recommends consuming at least two to three servings of fish per week, a goal that most Americans do not meet. In addition to fish and fish oil, other sources of omega-3 fatty acids include nuts and seeds, plant oils, and fortified foods. END"}

Their mission? To develop a groundbreaking new generation of biosynthetic lubricants that could potentially revolutionize arthritis treatment and alleviate the painful friction experienced with artificial joints.\n\nTo give you a visual representation, a confocal reflectance micrograph has captured the bioengineered lubricant, depicted in a vibrant green color, seamlessly coating the surface of articular cartilage.\n\nThe inception of this collaboration was sparked by a serendipitous \"aha\" moment a decade ago. Dr. Bonassar attended a presentation given by one of Dr. Putnam's doctoral students, who discussed innovative biomaterials that could prevent surgical adhesions. Among these materials, Dr. Bonassar noticed a synthetic polymer that strikingly resembled lubricin, a natural glycoprotein secreted in the synovial joint. This resemblance prompted an idea - could these polymers be modified to become effective lubricants for cartilage?\n\nFor nearly twenty years, Dr. Bonassar has dedicated his research to studying the mechanics and repair of cartilage. This remarkable tissue possesses an incredibly low coefficient of friction, making it even more slippery than ice on ice or Teflon on Teflon. The scientific community is still unraveling the mysteries behind this exceptional property.\n\nDr. Bonassar's lab has developed specialized instrumentation capable of measuring these minuscule friction coefficients, as well as identifying the crucial molecular components responsible for cartilage's exceptional lubrication. Two key players in this process are lubricin and hyaluronic acid. Together, they form a hydrophilic complex that attracts water to the tissue surface, providing lubrication. In cases of arthritis and traumatic injuries, this biopolymer layer becomes disrupted, reducing lubrication and subjecting the tissue to increased stress, ultimately damaging its cells.\n\nThrough their collaboration, Dr. Bonassar and Dr. Putnam successfully engineered a synthetic polymer that emulates the function of lubricin. Over time, their teamwork expanded to include Dr. Paszek, an expert in glycoprotein engineering, and Dr. Reesink, a specialist in validating therapeutics using animal models. Each member of the team brought their unique skills to the table, forming a critical mass of talent that operates much more effectively as a cohesive unit than as individuals working in parallel. This synergy allows for a continuous loop of innovation, with David and Matthew designing new molecules, testing them for lubricating abilities in the lab, while Heidi examines their therapeutic potential in live animals.\n\nThese biosynthetic lubricants have the potential to go beyond arthritis treatment and joint pain relief. They could address a myriad of physical ailments, including dry eyes, skin abrasions, inflammatory bowel disease, and specific digestive and reproductive issues - essentially anything related to mucosal layers unable to retain moisture effectively.\n\nLooking ahead, Dr. Bonassar envisions a bright future for their research. In five years, they hope to have promising candidates for injectable arthritis treatments, supported by compelling data obtained from animal studies. They also aim to establish general paradigms that can be applied to customize various lubricants for a wide range of medical applications.\n\nWith this ambitious and groundbreaking project, the interdisciplinary research team is poised to make a significant impact on the field of medicine, improving the lives of countless individuals suffering from joint pain and other related conditions.

The turnover of doctors, whether they are moving to new practices or retiring, can have a significant impact on the continuity and quality of patient care. Dr. Lawrence Casalino, a co-author of the study and professor emeritus of population health sciences, explains, \"Over time, a strong bond of mutual trust develops between doctors and their patients, making it challenging to replace that connection.\"\n\nTo estimate turnover, the study authors, led by Amelia Bond, developed a new method using Medicare data on provider practice and specialty. This information includes details on clinician characteristics, such as age, sex, physician specialty, and tax identification numbers of the practices in which physicians work. Through this data, the researchers created an algorithm that allowed them to estimate physician turnover from 2010 to the third quarter of 2020. Dr. Casalino believes this method may become the gold standard for identifying turnover in the future, as previous survey-based estimates have proven unreliable.\n\nThe researchers discovered that between 2010 and 2018, the annual rate of turnover increased by 43%, representing a substantial change. Most of the turnover occurred between 2010 and 2014 and resulted from doctors who stopped practicing. The reasons for this increase during those years remain unknown. Additionally, turnover poses challenges for accessing healthcare, especially for people living in rural areas and underserved communities. The researchers noted that doctors in rural areas were more likely to move or stop practicing compared to their urban counterparts. Female doctors also experienced higher turnover rates than male doctors. Furthermore, physicians in larger practices were more susceptible to turnover than those in single-doctor or two-physician practices. Doctors who served more patients eligible for Medicare and Medicaid were also more likely to experience turnover.\n\nDespite the stability of turnover rates between 2014 and 2017, there was a slight increase in 2018. However, data from the second and third quarters of 2020 show a slightly lower turnover rate compared to the same period in 2019. While turnover seemed relatively unaffected early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Casalino emphasizes the need for more data to understand any potential trends.\n\nThis new method for measuring doctor turnover not only sheds light on the impacts of the pandemic but also provides insights into turnover following acquisitions by private equity companies, health insurers, or hospitals. Dr. Casalino explains, \"Once we understand the reasons behind doctor turnover, individual practices or hospitals can develop better programs to retain their providers.\" In a spirit of collaboration, the researchers are making their algorithm public for other researchers to utilize.

The study also found that written stories that include both career successes and setbacks are more effective at creating a connection than videos.\n\nThe researchers define \"journey\" as a long and challenging process of growth and learning, where individuals acquire new skills and develop personally. According to Ovul Sezer, an assistant professor at Cornell, including obstacles you've faced or lessons you've learned in your personal story can be valuable information to share. This is because sharing your journey helps to communicate humility, which can counteract the perception of arrogance often associated with self-promotion.\n\nSezer and her co-authors wanted to understand how people can introduce themselves in a way that is highly effective and successful. They conducted several studies using publicly available data from LinkedIn and found that users prefer written introductions that describe a journey because personal stories make individuals appear more humble. Humility is a crucial ingredient for creating a connection and conveying warmth.\n\nIn four pilot studies, the researchers surveyed working professionals to gain insight into how introductions are viewed. They found that introductions are seen as opportunities for self-promotion, but many people also express concerns about appearing arrogant. The researchers discovered that people not only aim to make a positive impression in general, but they are especially interested in creating a favorable impression on those who make hiring decisions.\n\nIn one study, the researchers tested whether human resource specialists evaluate written introductions that reference a professional journey more favorably than those that only focus on achievements. The specialists were provided with LinkedIn introductions to evaluate, and it was found that those with more journey information were perceived as warmer and more humble. This perception of warmth played a significant role in the specialists' desire to connect with the jobseeker.\n\nThe researchers wanted to explore how to strike a balance between presenting professional competency and avoiding arrogance. According to Sezer, while delivering an effective written introduction is important, the specific approach is less clear. The essence of their research aligns with Mark Twain's quote, \"Success is a journey, not a destination,\" highlighting the value of emphasizing one's professional journey rather than just the end result.

He soon discovered that this was due to highly toxic dyes, pigments, and finishes being dumped by a nearby textile factory. Inspired by this experience, Hinestroza, along with a team of chemists and engineers from Cornell University, is now tackling another environmental challenge – polyester textile waste.\n\nUsing their knowledge of chemistry, the team has found a way to break down old polyester clothing and repurpose its compounds to create fabrics with desirable properties such as fire resistance, antibacterial capabilities, and wrinkle-free attributes. By doing so, they are helping to reduce the amount of garment waste ending up in landfills. This circular approach aligns with the United Nations Environment Programme's efforts to combat overconsumption of clothing in developed countries. In fact, studies show that the number of times clothing is worn has decreased by 36% over the past two decades.\n\nIn the United States alone, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that each person discards over 70 pounds of textiles annually, with more than 85% ending up in landfills. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions.\n\nYelin Ko, a doctoral student working in Hinestroza's laboratory, demonstrates the team's groundbreaking technique. Using a combination of chemicals and carefully controlled processes, old polyester fabric is transformed into a lab soup, where its monomers are extracted. These monomers are then used to create metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) – versatile structures that can be utilized to create coatings on clothing to protect against germs, hazardous gases, and even for specialized uses like fire protection.\n\nThe potential of this technique is vast, and the team believes it can revolutionize the textile and apparel industry, which currently follows unsustainable practices. By incorporating these new processes, the material can be recycled instead of discarded. However, the team recognizes the importance of ensuring their technique is compatible with existing industry practices, as introducing new equipment and processes can be met with resistance.\n\nThe vision is for manufacturers to incorporate MOF chemistry into their existing infrastructure, ultimately creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly textile industry. By applying this innovative approach, the team aims to not only reduce textile waste but also contribute to a cleaner and healthier future for our planet. END"}

That's the approach of a new collaboration led by Cornell University. The researchers attached large fragments to these notoriously temperamental molecules, increasing their size to insulate them from their hyperreactive partners.\n\nBy adding groups of carbon and hydrogen atoms to the surface of these highly reactive radical molecules, they effectively gave each molecule a set of \"antlers.\" This allowed the molecules to maintain their native reactivity while keeping their partner at a safe distance. This technique could be incredibly valuable for creating new and improved derivatives of pharmaceutical compounds.\n\nThis project, led by Professor Song Lin, emerged from the Lin group's previous experiments with synthetic electrochemistry. In that process, electrodes pass an electrical current through a chemical reaction to activate inert molecules and form chemical bonds that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. Electrochemistry is also one of the most efficient ways to generate highly reactive radicals from simple chemical feedstocks.\n\n\"We thought, hey, when we have these radicals, how can we control them as well? If we can harness them and use them to react with a pharmaceutical, they can do really cool chemistry,\" Lin explained. \"It's our interest in electrochemistry and radical chemistry that allowed us to think about these fundamental problems.\"\n\nRadicals are highly reactive, but they have the potential to bond in pairs by sharing a pair of single electrons. The challenge lies in getting them close enough to cooperate without destroying each other. The researchers' solution was to bulk up the radicals by attaching groups of carbon and hydrogen atoms to their surface, effectively frustrating them. This allowed the radicals to preserve their reactivity while maintaining a safe distance from their partner.\n\n\"We use frustrated radicals to activate carbon-hydrogen bonds and convert them into other chemical bonds, which can alter the properties of the original molecule,\" Lin said. \"This strategy can be used to improve the efficacy of drug molecules, for example.\"\n\nCarbon-hydrogen bonds are ideal candidates for this task because they are commonly found in organic molecules. A carbon molecule, for example, can have upwards of 20 or 30 bonds. These bonds are also quite strong, which makes them valuable for pharmaceutical development. However, separating them out can be challenging due to their strength and abundance.\n\nLin's group collaborated with researchers from the San Francisco-based company Genentech to identify substrate targets that would enable the desired chemical reactions. They installed large functional groups on the frustrated radicals, such as trimethylsilyl, to control reactivity. This simple idea of using size to control reactivity has proved to be highly effective.\n\nOnce the products were created, the team analyzed their reactivity and selectivity using advanced techniques such as high-level nuclear magnetic resonance and gas and liquid chromatography. This technique can help medicinal chemists initiate various chemical transformations for different applications. It can assist in derivatizing more efficient pharmaceutical products, enhancing their biological activity, and even tracking how drugs degrade in the human body.\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and Genentech.

However, one major pollination company has swiftly taken action to adapt their bumblebee hive boxes in response to these findings. The study, which was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology in February, discovered that the bright colors of commercial bumblebee nest boxes attract wild queens, who may be looking to establish their own nests. Unfortunately, when these wild queens enter the commercial nest boxes, they are treated as invaders and are killed by the workers. This loss of wild hives and valuable pollinators has a negative impact on the ecosystem. \n\nFortunately, the study also found a solution. By attaching a device called an excluder to the nest box doorways, wild queens can be prevented from entering the hives. In fact, the excluders were found to be 100% effective in keeping the wild queens out. Plant Products, a North American subsidiary of Biobest, has already taken action by providing excluders for all the hives they ship, along with instructions on how to use them. Additionally, they have personally contacted every client to explain the purpose and benefits of the excluders. \n\nHeather Grab, a senior lecturer at the School of Integrative Plant Science at Cornell University, emphasized the importance of protecting the wild queens and the bumblebee colonies they could potentially establish. Each queen lost due to this behavior results in the potential loss of an entire colony of bumblebees that provide vital pollination services later in the season. The study revealed that an average of 10 queens per colony were being killed in their study region alone. \n\nInterestingly, the study also showed that the use of commercial bumblebee colonies actually led to a decline in pollination services compared to areas where they were not used. This decline is believed to be a result of the loss of wild pollinators. \n\nScott McArt, an associate professor of pollinator health at Cornell University, contacted Plant Products and Koppert, the only two North American commercial bumblebee suppliers, prior to the study's publication to inform them of the findings and suggest the use of excluders as a solution. By the time the study was published in February, Plant Products had already implemented the use of excluders in their shipments and had begun research and development to further improve their strategies. \n\nMcArt expressed his admiration for how quickly Biobest responded to the study's findings and implemented effective changes throughout their company. The excluders, originally developed for a different purpose, have proven to be instrumental in solving this issue. \n\nOverall, bumblebees have been experiencing population declines across North America, making it crucial to save queens early in the spring to help counteract these declines.

However, Gary Phan '23 is determined to change this mindset with his company, Sleeve. Sleeve helps sustainable boutique and small clothing stores reach larger markets for their clearance items or excess inventory.\n\nWhile many companies recommend sustainable clothing products, none of them address the affordability question. Phan believes that a lot of people are interested in purchasing sustainable fashion, but price becomes a barrier. This motivated him to create Sleeve, and his efforts were recognized when his company was chosen as one of 700 semifinalist teams for the Hult Prize.\n\nThe Hult Prize challenges young people to solve pressing global issues through social entrepreneurship, and this year's theme was sustainable fashion. Phan saw this as the perfect opportunity to apply. Although his team wasn't selected as a finalist, Phan described the experience as amazing, as they learned about innovative approaches to sustainable fashion from other countries.\n\nPhan's passion for sustainable fashion stems from his childhood dreams of creating his own ethical clothing brand. However, he realized that being 100% sustainable and ethical can be expensive, especially coming from a low-income background. When Phan joined the Social Enterprise Group at Cornell, they came up with the idea for a Chrome extension that would guide consumers away from fast fashion and towards more sustainable alternatives.\n\nEventually, Phan's team shifted their focus from the Chrome extension to an online marketplace after conducting extensive research and customer discovery. They specifically target smaller sustainable clothing companies because they face more marketing challenges. Currently, the Sleeve site features 25 brands, but Phan mentioned that more will be added soon.\n\nTo reach their target audience of college students and young adults, Sleeve utilizes platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and email campaigns. They also collaborate with social media influencers in the sustainable fashion space. Additionally, the company plans to launch ambassador programs at universities by the end of the year.\n\nPhan's team consists of students from Cornell University, as well as UCLA, USC, Cal State Pomona, and Cal State Long Beach. They also have graduates with experience in sustainable fashion and web development. Phan expressed his gratitude towards his team, the elab program, and Nancy Almann from Blackstone Launchpad for their support throughout Sleeve's development.\n\nOnce Phan graduates in December, he hopes to work on Sleeve full-time. He has a passion for entrepreneurship and is excited to continue building and growing the company. Sleeve is actively seeking partnerships with sustainable and ethical fashion brands, and Phan encourages interested brands to reach out.\n\nAs for Phan's personal fashion sense, he admits that he has become more fashionable over the years. However, what matters most to him is the durability and longevity of the clothes he wears. END"}

Thanks to an algorithm developed by researchers at Cornell University and Google Research called Dynibar, this software can synthesize new views using the original video's pixel information, even with moving objects and unstable camerawork.\n\nThis breakthrough is a major advancement compared to previous efforts. Earlier attempts only produced a few seconds of video and often resulted in blurry or glitchy images of moving subjects. However, Dynibar tackles these challenges and offers promising results.\n\nAlthough this research is still in its early stages and not yet integrated into commercial video editing tools, the code for this project is freely available. Noah Snavely, a research scientist at Google Research and an associate professor of computer science at Cornell Tech, is enthusiastic about the potential future applications for both personal and professional use.\n\nThrough the years, there have been significant strides in view synthesis methods. These algorithms can take a collection of images capturing a scene from different viewpoints and generate new views. However, most of these methods struggled with scenes that involve moving people, pets, or swaying trees. This limitation is a significant concern since many interesting things in the world are constantly in motion.\n\nTo tackle this problem, the researchers incorporated a computer graphics approach called image-based rendering. This method, developed in the 1990s, allows for the rendering of complex scenes with many small parts, such as a leafy tree. By altering and recombining the parts of an image, new images can be generated, thus capturing the complexity of the scene. This classic idea of image-based rendering formed the foundation for Dynibar, taking it a step further by estimating object movements over time.\n\nDespite this significant advancement, these features may not be available on smartphones anytime soon. Even on a powerful computer, the software requires several hours to process just 10 or 20 seconds of video. In the short term, it may be more suitable for use in offline video editing software. The next challenge for the researchers is to find ways to render new images when original video lacks pixel information, such as when subjects move too fast or users want to rotate the viewpoint 180 degrees. Snavely and Wang believe that incorporating generative AI techniques, like text-to-image generators, could help fill in these gaps.\n\nThis research project also received contributions from Forrester Cole and Richard Tucker from Google Research.

However, researchers from Cornell University have discovered that it can also be incredibly helpful for improving the algorithm behind a new financial prediction model.\n\nIn their recent paper titled \"News-Based Sparse Machine Learning Models for Adaptive Asset Pricing,\" which was published in Data Science in April, the researchers combine expertise from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and finance to develop a new and easily understandable machine learning framework. This framework captures specific information about stocks and industries, allowing for more accurate predictions of financial returns compared to traditional models.\n\nLead author Liao Zhu, who is now working in the finance industry, explains that the text helps to organize and understand the chaotic results that algorithms can sometimes produce. The researchers hypothesize that financial news can provide valuable insights into which stocks are related to certain tradable assets.\n\nThis paper builds upon Zhu's previous research conducted during his early doctoral studies. He worked alongside Wells and Robert Jarrow, esteemed experts in investment management at Cornell University. Co-author Peter Wu also contributed to this groundbreaking research.\n\nWhile it is not new to apply traditional statistical methods to market data in order to explain stock returns, nor is it new to analyze texts for sentiment analysis, this research takes a different approach. It introduces a flexible prediction framework that combines market data and text data without relying on sentiment analysis. Instead, it utilizes interpretable machine learning algorithms.\n\nTo achieve this, the researchers adopted the concept of \"word embeddings\" from natural language processing and applied it to financial news to create \"asset embeddings\" for specific tradable assets. By converting both text and market data into numerical form, the researchers were able to develop custom-designed algorithms to analyze the data.\n\nZhu clarifies that their algorithm does not rely on sentiment from the news, but rather uses it as a guide to determine which assets and words to consider for each specific stock or industry. This reveals more precise information about stocks and industries.\n\nIn order to develop their models, the researchers collected a vast amount of online financial news articles from 2013 to 2019 and fed them into their algorithm. This allowed them to map out specific assets and words associated with particular stocks and industries. Armed with an AI-optimized language map, the researchers gained invaluable insight into which assets and words to focus on.\n\nUsing this innovative approach, the team created two separate models. The first is called the News Embedding UMAP Sparse Selection (NEUSS) model, which predicts returns for individual stocks. The second model, the News Sparse Encoder with Rationale (INSER) model, identifies important words for each specific industry and uses them to make more accurate predictions about industry returns.\n\nFor example, the NEUSS model may conclude from financial news that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the semiconductor manufacturing sector is useful in predicting the stock returns of a particular tech company. However, it may not be as useful in predicting returns for other stocks in industries like retail or wholesale. On the other hand, the INSER model may identify the word \"plant\" as significant in the energy industry, but this word may not hold the same relevance for other industries such as social media.\n\nOverall, this research demonstrates the value of incorporating financial news into machine learning models for predicting financial returns. By bridging the gap between market data and text data, the researchers have developed a more accurate and interpretable framework that can enhance investment decisions. END"}

The processing of NFT transactions has become more sustainable thanks to a switch to a more energy-efficient algorithm. However, the anticipated increase in NFT activity could offset these energy savings. Currently, excess renewable energy goes to waste due to a lack of storage capability. Our proposal aims to utilize this untapped energy potential for a good cause. It's like lending a car that is not being driven to someone for carsharing. Similarly, we can use the underutilized wind, solar, and hydropower sources to power NFT transactions. While this decision ultimately lies with the industry and policymakers, technologically speaking, it is very feasible since these power sources already exist. \n\nOur key finding suggests that un- or underutilized power sources could partially power the increased NFT processing activity. For example, fifty megawatts of potential hydropower from existing dams in the U.S. that are currently not used to generate power, or a 15% utilization of wind and solar energy in Texas that cannot be currently used or stored, could support a significant increase in NFT transactions. Blockchain technologies, including NFTs, offer high security in various applications, but the energy required for each transaction is problematic in a world affected by climate change. Without any efforts to make NFT transaction processing more sustainable, the annual emissions from these transactions will reach a level equivalent to the CO2 emissions from 1 million flights from New York to London. \n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain responded to the need for sustainability by switching to a less energy-intensive consensus mechanism. This resulted in a drastic decrease in energy consumption. However, with an exponential rise in NFT transactions, the number of validators operating on the network will increase. By the end of this decade, the energy consumed by these transactions could be equivalent to that of 100,000 U.S. households. Despite lower energy consumption per transaction, the cumulative effect of increased validators on fossil fuel-dominant grids will lead to a further rise in carbon emissions. In fact, the carbon produced by NFT transactions could be similar to that produced by a 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant in a year.\n\nThe authors of the study also investigated the viability of two hydroelectric energy carriers, green hydrogen and green ammonia. The cost savings of these carriers depend on factors such as transportation distances and the utilization levels of renewable energy sources. Retrofitting these existing power sources may present challenges, but it would be beneficial for both energy carriers and the environment. \"NFT processing requires a significant amount of power,\" said one of the researchers. \"This turns out to be a great way to make use of these unused energy resources.\"\n\nThis research was made possible through a grant from the National Science Foundation.

Researchers conducted a study using a well-known model of limited computational power to simulate human behaviors. They created automatons that competed against each other in a wildlife poaching game, either as a rhino poacher or a ranger trying to prevent poaching.\n\nWhen the automatons had perfect memory, they developed an optimal strategy for the game. However, when their memories were limited, they took shortcuts in decision-making, just like actual humans playing the game. This supports the concept of bounded rationality, which suggests that sometimes we make mistakes or act in silly ways not because we're irrational, but because we have limited resources. We can't always remember everything or have enough time to make fully rational decisions.\n\nThe study was presented at the 2023 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems by Xinming Liu, the first author, and the senior author is Joseph Halpern, a professor of computer science. In the poaching game, there are several sites with varying probabilities of containing a rhino. The poacher and ranger choose a site to visit in each round based on previous data. The poacher gains points by catching a rhino, while the ranger gains points by catching the poacher.\n\nThe automatons' strategy wasn't perfect, but it still yielded decent results. Another behavior that seemed irrational, but led to good game performance, was overweighting significant results. This means that important or traumatic incidents have a stronger influence on memory. For example, a person might drive slowly on a road where they received a speeding ticket years ago. When the researchers programmed the poachers to overweight previous encounters with the ranger, it paid off in the game. They ended up avoiding sites where the rangers were most likely to be.\n\nTo compare these results to actual humans, Liu recruited around 100 people to play as the poacher on an online platform. Some participants chose the same site every time or picked randomly just to finish the game and receive payment. Others made decisions based purely on probability matching. A third group assumed the ranger was probability matching and visited sites accordingly to avoid the ranger. The similarity in gameplay between humans and automatons demonstrates that the model can replicate at least two human behaviors that, far from being irrational, actually improved performance.\n\nAnother way to interpret these findings is to understand that we all do the best we can give our computational limitations. This perspective suggests that our behavior is rational, considering the resources we have. END"}

With a generous $11.3 million grant from the Office of Naval Research, Cornell is establishing the Scientific Artificial Intelligence Center (SCIAI Center). This exciting initiative will bring together experts from various disciplines to collaborate on projects that use mathematics as a universal language.\n\nThe SCIAI Center is spearheaded by Christopher J. Earls, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell Engineering. The team also includes talented individuals such as Nikolaos Bouklas, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, Anil Damle, an assistant professor of computer science, and Alex Townsend, an associate professor of mathematics. All of these accomplished researchers are faculty members of the Center for Applied Mathematics.\n\nThe rise of AI systems, with their complex algorithms and vast amounts of training data, has left scientists concerned about the lack of transparency in AI's decision-making process. How AI recognizes patterns in data and makes scientific predictions remains somewhat mysterious. This situation contradicts the essence of scientific discovery, according to Earls. Scientific theories are not just explanations of observed phenomena, but also powerful tools for predicting future observations. Unfortunately, standard AI falls short in this aspect.\n\nTo address this issue, the SCIAI Center will pioneer innovative AI approaches for scientific discovery. The team will use mathematics as a shared language between humans and machines. As Alex Townsend explains, mathematics has long been the foundation of scientific modeling, allowing us to understand the world around us. Instead of relying solely on data, the SCIAI Center will teach AI to speak the language of calculus and derive the underlying differential equations that govern physical systems. By doing so, they hope to unlock the hidden patterns within nature and revolutionize our understanding of the world.\n\nThe SCIAI Center will focus on four main areas of research: scientific data, operator learning, closure models, and complex systems. These research thrusts will be applied to materials, turbulence, and autonomy, enabling advancements in fields such as materials science and autonomous systems.\n\nBeyond its research pursuits, the SCIAI Center is committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity in science and engineering. Through student pathway programs, they aim to provide underrepresented groups with access to AI tools and prepare the next generation of researchers to thrive in emerging industries. This dedication to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and supporting a broad range of researchers makes Cornell an ideal home for the SCIAI Center.\n\nThe venture also involves the participation of esteemed institutions such as the United States Naval Academy, the University of California, Santa Cruz, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Cambridge, Brown University, the University of California, Berkeley, and Integer Technologies. Together, these institutions form a formidable alliance in the pursuit of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nIn summary, Cornell's SCIAI Center is at the forefront of harnessing the potential of AI to drive scientific innovation.

This breakthrough offers scientists a streamlined approach to analyze potential candidates for quantum computing and microelectronics, among other applications. \n\nScientists are particularly interested in nanotextures that are distributed non-uniformly throughout a thin film because they can give the material unique properties. Traditionally, studying these nanotextures required complex electron microscopy, which often did not preserve the sample. However, the new imaging technique, detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, overcomes these challenges.\n\nBy utilizing phase retrieval and machine learning, the researchers can now transform conventionally-collected x-ray diffraction data, such as that produced at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, into real-space visualizations of the material at the nanoscale. This use of x-ray diffraction not only makes the technique more accessible to scientists but also allows for imaging a larger portion of the sample.\n\nAccording to Andrej Singer, assistant professor of materials science and engineering and David Croll Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow in Cornell Engineering, \"Imaging a large area is crucial as it represents the true state of the material. The nanotexture measured by a local probe could depend on the chosen spot.\"\n\nAnother advantage of this new method is that it does not require breaking apart the sample, enabling dynamic studies of thin films. For example, introducing light to observe how structures evolve becomes possible. Ziming Shao, a doctoral student involved in the research, stated, \"This method can be readily applied to study dynamics in-situ or operando. For example, we plan to use the method to study how the structure changes within picoseconds after excitation with short laser pulses, which might enable new concepts for future terahertz technologies.\" \n\nThe effectiveness of this technique was demonstrated through testing on two thin films. In one instance, the researchers successfully validated the imaging results by studying a thin film with a known nanotexture. Additionally, when exploring a mott insulator film associated with superconductivity, they discovered a previously unseen strain-induced nanopattern that forms naturally during cooling to cryogenic temperatures.\n\nZiming Shao emphasized the significance of the findings, stating, \"The images are extracted without prior knowledge, potentially setting new benchmarks and informing novel physical hypotheses in phase-field modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations.\"\n\nThe research team included co-authors Lena Kourkoutis, the late associate professor of applied and engineering physics, Kyle Shen, the James A.

They have discovered and visualized a new phase of matter in a unique superconductor called uranium ditelluride (UTE2). Using advanced technology, they found a crystalline yet superconducting state, which they call a \"spin-triplet electron-pair crystal.\" This discovery has significant implications for the study of topological quantum matter.\n\nThe researchers at Cornell's Macroscopic Quantum Matter Group used a powerful scanning microscope to observe this state at the atomic level. Their findings, titled \"Detection of a Pair of Density Wave State in UTE2,\" were published in the prestigious journal Nature.\n\nQiangqiang Gu, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell, led this research alongside Joe Carroll from University College Cork and Shuqiu Wang from Oxford University. Gu explains that topological superconductors, which have odd parity pairing potential, are being researched extensively as a potential platform for ultra-stable quantum computers. However, identifying materials that exhibit this behavior has been challenging.\n\nUranium ditelluride has recently emerged as a promising candidate for topological superconductivity. However, its superconductive order parameter remains elusive. Theoretical physicists proposed that UTE2 could be in a topological pair-density-wave state, a form of quantum matter that had never been detected before.\n\nIn simple terms, a pair-density wave is like a stationary dance of paired electrons in a superconductor. These pairs form periodic crystalline patterns in space. Gu's team at Cornell, who invented the scanning Josephson tunnelling microscope, were the first to observe a pair-density wave in 2016. They have since pioneered studies at extremely low temperatures with high energy resolution.\n\nFor the UTE2 project, they directly visualized the spatial modulations of the superconducting pairing potential at the atomic scale. They found that these modulations aligned with the predicted behavior of a pair-density wave state. This new quantum matter state, known as a topological pair density wave, is composed of spin-triplet Cooper pairs.\n\nCooper-pair density waves differ from conventional superconductors as pairs of electrons freeze into a superconductive state rather than freely moving. Gu describes the discovery of the first pair-density wave in spin-triplet superconductors as exciting. Uranium-based heavy fermion superconducting compounds provide a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity. This discovery also indicates that this intriguing quantum state exists in a variety of superconductors, opening up new possibilities for studying these states in different materials.\n\nOverall, this groundbreaking research expands our understanding of topological quantum matter and brings us closer to developing ultra-stable quantum computers. The discovery of the pair-density wave state in UTE2 has significant implications for the field of condensed matter physics and could lead to exciting new advancements in quantum computing and spintronics.

By analyzing factors such as time of day, neighborhood demographics, proximity to police stations, and commercial districts, they were able to identify patterns in police deployment. Their findings revealed that Gramercy Park in midtown Manhattan had the highest number of police vehicles captured in dashcam images, while Arden Heights\/Rossville in southern Staten Island had the fewest. Interestingly, areas with more police vehicle images included both wealthy commercial zones and low-income neighborhoods with higher proportions of Black and Latino residents.\n\nThe senior authors of this research are Wendy Ju, an associate professor of information science, and Emma Pierson, an assistant professor of computer science, both at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech. They are field members in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. The researchers emphasized that while data on police stops, use of force, searches, criminal incidents, and arrests is publicly available, information regarding the deployment of officers is not typically disclosed due to security concerns. They noted that disparities in deployment can lead to biases, such as increased arrests in certain neighborhoods where policing is more prominent. It is important to recognize that a neighborhood with a higher police presence may not necessarily have higher crime rates; rather, it may result in a higher number of people being arrested.\n\nIn 2020, the team, which included J.D. Zamfirescu-Pereira, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, obtained 24.8 million dashcam images from Nexar, a company that provides dashboard cameras to rideshare drivers. Companies like Uber actually recommend drivers to install cameras for their own protection. Nexar made their proprietary images, taken between March 4, 2020, and November 15, 2020, available for research purposes. Originally, the Cornell team used this dataset to gather information on how people in New York City were practicing social distancing during the pandemic. However, they later used thousands of annotated images to train a deep learning model to identify marked police vehicles. It is important to note that while the model could identify the presence of police vehicles, it could not determine their reasons for being there.\n\nThe researchers identified over 233,000 images containing marked police vehicles, which were taken across all five boroughs of New York City and at various times of the day. They then studied these geotagged images in the context of specific factors such as neighborhood, borough, and zone type, as well as whether the pictures were taken in bustling commercial areas, manufacturing areas, or primary residential locations.

How this inner core formed and evolved over time is still a mystery, but a team of researchers is working diligently to uncover its secrets using seismic waves from natural earthquakes.\n\nAlthough the inner core is relatively small, comprising less than 1% of the Earth's total volume, it has a profound impact on our planet. It is responsible for generating Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for maintaining the conditions necessary for life. Without the inner core, our planet would be a vastly different place.\n\nContrary to previous assumptions, the inner core is not a homogeneous mass. It is more like a tapestry of different materials, as described by Guanning Pang, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Engineering. Pang and his team recently published a groundbreaking study in Nature, which sheds light on the deep realms of our planet. Their findings confirm that this heterogeneity exists throughout the inner core.\n\nStudying the Earth's interior is challenging because we cannot directly access it. However, earthquakes provide valuable seismic waves that allow us to explore this hidden realm. As explained by Keith Koper, a researcher involved in the study, the Earth formed from asteroids colliding in space, generating immense energy and melting the entire planet. Eventually, the heavier iron sank to the middle to form the core, while the liquid rock surrounded it and solidified over time.\n\nThe magnetic field surrounding Earth is created by the convection within the liquid outer core, which extends above the solid inner core. This circulation causes molten metal to rise, cool as it reaches the rocky mantle, and sink back down. This process results in the formation of bands of electrons that protect our planet. Without the solid inner core, this protective field would be weaker, exposing the Earth's surface to harmful radiation and solar winds that could strip away our atmosphere and make it uninhabitable.\n\nIn their study, Pang and Koper analyzed seismic data collected from 20 arrays of seismometers placed worldwide, including two in Antarctica. By studying the seismic waves generated by over 2,400 earthquakes of magnitude 5.7 or higher, they were able to map the internal structure of the inner core. This was made possible by the strategic placement of the seismometers, similar to the way parabolic antennae work.\n\nThe use of seismic waves to determine the solidity of the inner core was first established in 1936 by Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann. Prior to her discovery, it was widely believed that the entire core was liquid due to its extremely high temperature, reaching nearly 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, similar to the surface of the sun.\n\nThe study was a collaborative effort involving researchers from the University of Southern California, the Université de Nantes in France, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. It was funded by the National Science Foundation, highlighting the importance of continuing scientific exploration and understanding of our planet's inner workings. END"}
{"prompt":"an atlas that catalogues gene activity and the levels of small molecules called metabolites in tumor samples offers a new way of identifying the deep mechanisms of cancer , according to researchers at weill cornell medicine and memorial sloan kettering cancer center . the researchers , who published their work june 19 in nature metabolism , created the cancer atlas of metabolic profiles ( camp ) by combining new and existing datasets on metabolites and gene activity . the atlas contains data from 988 tumor and normal-tissue control samples across 11 different cancer types . the scientists’ analysis of the data revealed two broad classes of gene-metabolite connections that point to mechanisms at work across cancer types . “this new atlas will help us build a core understanding of how tumors function , ” said study co-senior author jan krumsiek , assistant professor of physiology and biophysics and a member of the sandra and edward meyer cancer center at weill cornell medicine . the pattern of metabolite levels in tissues is one of the important layers of information in biology , and researchers already know that key events in cancer , such as tumor development and the acquisition of drug resistance , are accompanied by significant changes in metabolites . relating these cancer-associated metabolite changes to changes in gene activity helps scientists understand why these metabolite changes occur – for example , which enzymes or other proteins are driving the changes . in some cases , disrupting those mechanisms could help fight the cancer . the camp database the scientists created is meant facilitate such analyses , for it is the largest-ever harmonized collection of data on metabolite and gene-activity levels in primary tumor samples . putting it together was a serious challenge , though . “the methods used in studies of metabolites have been much less standardized than the methods in , say , rna sequencing studies , ” krumsiek said . “it’s often the case that two different cancer metabolite studies won’t measure the same set of metabolites , and even the metabolites that are measured in both studies will sometimes have different names in the datasets . ” having painstakingly aligned the disparate features of the individual datasets , the scientists sought clues to broad cancer mechanisms by looking for gene-metabolite relationships that were prominent across all cancer types covered in the database . one pattern they found was expected some metabolites were strongly correlated with genes encoding enzymes and other proteins with roles in producing metabolites or otherwise regulating their levels . identifying genes that control cancer-associated metabolite levels can help in further investigations of these metabolites’ possible roles in driving cancer , krumsiek said . in the other prominent pattern the team discovered , some metabolites were strongly linked to the activities of broad sets of genes – genes not clearly related to metabolite production and processing . looking closely at the genes involved , krumsiek and reznik realized that this pattern likely reflected the presence of immune cells , which commonly infiltrate solid tumors . the results underscore the importance of understanding the contributions of different cell types in tumor samples , he added . to that end , he and reznik and their teams now plan to move to more advanced techniques that can “map” gene activity and metabolite levels at precise locations across tumor samples . many weill cornell medicine physicians and scientists maintain relationships and collaborate with external organizations to foster scientific innovation and provide expert guidance . the institution makes these disclosures public to ensure transparency . for this information , see profile for dr . krumsiek . ->","completion":" Researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have developed a new tool called the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles (CAMP) which catalogs gene activity and levels of small molecules in tumor samples. This atlas provides a novel way of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer. The researchers compiled data from 988 tumors and normal-tissue control samples across 11 different types of cancer, creating the largest-ever collection of data on metabolite and gene-activity levels in primary tumor samples.\n\nBy analyzing this data, the scientists discovered two broad classes of gene-metabolite connections that are present across various types of cancer. This knowledge will help us gain a core understanding of how tumors function. The patterns of metabolite level in tissues are crucial in biology, as significant changes in metabolites often accompany key events in cancer, such as tumor development and drug resistance. By linking these changes to gene activity, scientists can identify the enzymes or proteins that are driving these changes. Disrupting these mechanisms could potentially aid in fighting cancer.\n\nCreating the CAMP database was a challenging task as the methods used in metabolite studies are less standardized than other types of studies. However, the researchers overcame this by aligning the different datasets and looking for gene-metabolite relationships that were consistent across all types of cancer. They also found that some metabolites were strongly linked to the activities of broad sets of genes, which likely indicated the presence of immune cells in solid tumors. This highlights the importance of understanding the contributions of different cell types in tumor samples.\n\nMoving forward, the researchers plan to use more advanced techniques to map gene activity and metabolite levels at specific locations across tumor samples. This will provide even more detailed insights into the mechanisms of cancer. Weill Cornell Medicine prioritizes collaboration with external organizations to foster scientific innovation and provide expert guidance. Transparency is important, which is why disclosures are made public. For more information, please refer to the profile for Dr. Krumsiek. END"}

A recent study conducted by psychology researchers at Cornell University revealed that when decision-makers were shown \"sexy\" photos of female applicants for scholarships or jobs, these applicants were viewed less favorably compared to their male counterparts. This highlights a \"sexual double standard\" that is rooted in societal norms and assumptions about gender and sexuality.\n\nThis finding raises a dilemma for young people, especially those who are just starting their careers or are still in college. You want to focus on your professional and academic outcomes, but at the same time, you also care about your social life and communicating with friends. It's easy to unintentionally post photos that may have negative effects on other aspects of your life.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that women are more likely than men to post photos on social media. This could be because women seek validation, but unfortunately, there can be a potential penalty for doing so.\n\nIn today's digital age, where more than 4 billion people have social media accounts, it's becoming increasingly common for recruiters and hiring managers to research job candidates on these platforms. In fact, a national survey conducted in 2018 found that 70% of recruiters have used social media to research candidates, and over half of them have found content that made them decide not to hire someone.\n\nThe researchers at Cornell conducted four separate experiments to investigate this issue. The first two experiments involved college-age participants acting as scholarship recipient decision-makers, while the other two experiments involved older individuals with hiring experience acting as job recruiters. In all four experiments, participants were shown different sets of photos depicting men and women in either semi-professional or sexualized attire.\n\nThe results showed that participants preferred the female candidates in the semi-professional images. However, when it came to the sexualized images, the preference shifted towards the male candidates. This finding was consistent across all the studies.\n\nIt's important to note that this preference for female candidates in the semi-professional context is not surprising, as past research has shown similar results. However, what is interesting is the complete reversal in preference when participants were exposed to sexy social media photos.\n\nThis study sheds light on the potential consequences of posting certain types of photos on social media. It reminds us to be mindful of the image we project online, as it can impact our professional opportunities.\n\nThis research was supported by Cornell University and the National Science Foundation.

They have found the first evidence of gravitational waves, which are like ripples in space-time. These waves are likely caused by pairs of supermassive black holes merging. This discovery is a result of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center's research. They had previously detected hints of these waves, but the signal was too faint to confirm their existence. However, now, after 15 years of observations using radio telescopes and rapidly spinning pulsars, they have compelling evidence of gravitational waves that last for years to decades.\n\nOne important tool in their research was the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, which unfortunately collapsed in 2020. It was the largest and most sensitive radio telescope in the world and contributed to about half of NANOGrav's gravitational wave sensitivity. The detection and ongoing measurements of these waves will greatly advance our understanding of the universe's evolution on both large and small scales. This includes gaining insights into how often galaxies collide, what drives black hole mergers, and even the fundamental nature of gravity itself.\n\nThe newly detected gravitational waves are different from the ones detected in 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The earlier waves were high-frequency and created by the collision of black holes that were 30 times more massive than the sun. In contrast, the waves discovered by NANOGrav are low-frequency and likely generated by orbiting pairs of the universe's most massive black holes. These black holes can be millions or billions of times more massive than the sun and have sizes larger than the distance between the Earth and the sun.\n\nSupported by the National Science Foundation, NANOGrav collected data using various observatories, including the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico (prior to its collapse in 2020), the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. These ground-based observatories measured radio waves emitted by a network of 68 pulsars located within a few thousand light years of Earth. Pulsars are ultra-dense remnants of massive stars that emit beams of radio waves at precise intervals, similar to a lighthouse beacon.\n\nOne of the researchers involved in this project, Thankful Cromartie, highlighted the significance of millisecond pulsars, stating that they not only provide insights into astrophysics but also allow for the study of various physics phenomena, from gravitational waves to the behavior of matter in neutron star cores. The precision of measurements obtained from these pulsars is remarkable, approaching atomic-clock precision.\n\nThe NANOGrav collaboration's discovery of low-frequency gravitational waves is a significant breakthrough. This was made possible through 15 years of pulsar observations, effectively turning the Milky Way into a gravitational wave detector on a galactic scale. These waves cause slight deviations in the timing of pulsar beams as they stretch and compress the space between the pulsars and Earth. The researchers found consistent correlations in these timing deviations, confirming the presence of gravitational waves. Interestingly, the waves were detected as a background \"hum\" rather than originating from a single source. It's like hearing overlapping voices in a crowd or instruments in an orchestra.\n\nAs the measurements continue to improve, the NANOGrav project expects to identify individual pairs of supermassive black holes for further investigation. This is similar to picking out specific notes from a cosmic orchestra. This discovery is just the beginning, and there is still much more to learn.\n\nSeveral Cornell researchers, including Stella Ocker and Sashabaw Niedbalski, have contributed to the NANOGrav collaboration, along with many former undergraduates, doctoral students, and postdoctoral researchers.

A recent study by one of the leading consulting firms confirms that the mere presence of Shop Pay, even if not used by a buyer, increases conversion rates by 5%.\n\nAccording to Kaz Nejatian, VP Product and Chief Operating Officer of Shopify, enterprises that don't take advantage of Shop Pay are missing out on potential revenue. In a highly competitive retail environment, this flexibility is crucial. Big brands need the ability to select and implement the tools that will boost their sales without undergoing a complete platform overhaul.\n\nSo, what makes Shop Pay so powerful? We've been able to create the world's best-converting checkout because of four key advantages: Shopify's extensive identity network, unmatched scale, consumer trust, and commitment to constant innovation. When someone with a Shop Pay account visits an online store, Shopify recognizes them with just one click. If they've used Shop Pay recently, our checkout process can recognize them without any additional steps. This means Shop Pay can automatically fill in all their information for a seamless, one-click checkout experience, which is four times faster than a guest checkout.\n\nWe understand that different businesses have different payment requirements, which is why Shopify currently offers over 1,000 payment gateways. Adyen has been one of our trusted gateways for years, and we're now taking our integration to the next level specifically for enterprise retailers. With Adyen, it becomes easy to accept a wide variety of payments in markets around the world, including credit cards, popular wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, and international payment methods like iDEAL in the Netherlands and Cartes Bancaires in France. This enhanced integration is expected to be available later this year. END"}

I understand the impact this decision has on each of you, and it was not made lightly.\n\nWithin the next 5 minutes, you will receive a follow-up message informing you whether you are affected by these changes. I want to acknowledge that there is no way to make this news good, but we have put together a package to make it the best possible version of a challenging day. I have included details below on how we will support you through this transition.\n\nAt Shopify, we often talk about main quests and side quests. The main quest represents our mission, the reason for our company's existence. Side quests are everything else. While side quests can be distracting, sometimes they are worth pursuing if they contribute to the success of our main quest. However, as companies grow larger, they tend to accumulate more side quests and distractions, which can slow them down. We have been actively removing anything that hinders us from creating the best possible product, as we anticipate a decade of rapid change and innovation.\n\nOur main quest at Shopify is to simplify, democratize, and make commerce more accessible. We believe we have built the best commerce platform in the world to achieve this. With the AI era upon us, new possibilities have emerged, and Shopify has the opportunity to use AI to support our customers' entrepreneurial journeys. Our main quest now demands that we adapt and embrace these new capabilities.\n\nTo those who will be leaving Shopify today, I understand that this news will be difficult to process. We all cope with such changes in our own way, and it is tough for everyone, whether you are affected or not. As an employee who is leaving, you will receive a minimum of 16 weeks severance, with an additional week for every year of tenure at Shopify.

According to a recent survey commissioned by Google Cloud, when a customer can't find what they're looking for and leaves, it costs retailers around the world over $2 trillion annually. This is a significant amount that no enterprise business with a wide range of products can afford to lose.\n\nThat's why we're excited to announce that we have strengthened our partnership with Google to bring their advanced search and discovery tools to enterprise brands using Shopify's commerce components. This means that the largest brands in the world will now have access to Google Cloud's Discovery AI solutions, which can integrate directly with their online stores.\n\nBy utilizing these AI solutions, retailers can expect significant improvements in their search functionality. For instance, the retail search capability enhances the understanding of even the most complex queries, ensuring fast and relevant product discovery. Additionally, AI-powered personalization optimizes the display and ordering of products based on individual shopper preferences, leading to a more personalized shopping experience.\n\nOur collaboration with Google Cloud presents a trillion-dollar opportunity for brands. We understand that customers heavily rely on a store's search feature when shopping, with 69% of consumers in the US alone stating it as their primary method. However, only around 10% of them receive consistently accurate search results. This is a massive problem that we are determined to solve through our continued work with Google.\n\nThe integration of Google Cloud with Shopify empowers brands to deploy the power of AI quickly and effortlessly. This allows shoppers to find exactly what they want faster, resulting in a more satisfying shopping experience. Rainbow Shops, an apparel brand with a significant presence in the US and an extensive product range, is one of the first retailers to utilize this integration. Since implementing the Google-quality search, their search volume has increased by 48%.\n\nCommerce components by Shopify, our modern and flexible stack for enterprise retail, was launched earlier this year. We are proud to have renowned brands like Mattel, Glossier, JB Hi-Fi, Coty, Steve Madden, Spanx, and Staples already benefiting from our platform.\n\nTo learn more about commerce components by Shopify, please visit our website.

In celebration of International Women's Day, we want to introduce you to five inspiring women who are making a significant impact on the world economy. Women are vital in powering economies worldwide, and at Shopify, 53% of our entrepreneurs are women. It's incredible to think that there are now over 413 million women entrepreneurs globally, a far cry from when the idea of women in business was once unthinkable.\n\nWhile women still face challenges in raising venture capital and wage inequality persists, data shows that businesses led by women actually earn more for every dollar invested compared to their male counterparts. At Shopify, we are proud to support and champion women-led businesses not just this month, but every month.\n\nIn March, we want to shine a spotlight on three exceptional companies led by determined women who are catalysts for change in their respective industries. We will be cheering them on as they continue to make a difference in their corners of the world and beyond.\n\nOne such example is Sandra Velasquez, who launched Nopalera, a beauty brand that celebrates her Mexican heritage, in 2020. In just three years, Nopalera is now available at major retailers like Credo Beauty, Nordstrom, and Free People. Velasquez had a bold vision to disrupt the historically Euro-centric beauty space and create a high-end Latina brand. She believes that our culture is rich, beautiful, and deserving of the same recognition and value.\n\nRaised in California as the daughter of Mexican immigrants, Velasquez found inspiration in the nopales, the prickly cacti that lined her hometown streets. At 43 years old, after a successful career as a musician and a job in sales, she yearned for more but wasn't sure how to achieve it. She took a risk, delving into the world of organic skincare formulation in her Brooklyn apartment-turned-laboratory. Using the oil from nopales, she created a range of soaps, exfoliants, and moisturizers. Today, you can still find Nopalera on her kitchen table and in over 400 boutiques across the US. Velasquez's driving force is the hope that in the future, another Latina entrepreneur will see Nopalera's logo on their own pitch deck, proving that they too can achieve success.\n\nKathryn Shah, on the other hand, discovered her inspiration during her travels across the Middle East and India, where she admired how other cultures presented fruit, nuts, and dates as luxurious indulgences. This contrasted with the way these products were stored in dusty bulk bins back home in the US. When diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 35, Shah had a revelation. She received countless boxes of chocolates and cookies, but upon reading the labels, she realized the negative impact these foods could have on her health. This sparked the idea for something better – delicious, beautiful, and nutritious treats.\n\nShah's journey began in her kitchen, experimenting with recipes and using only the finest ingredients. This process remains at the heart of their product development, which now includes six bars of date-sweetened chocolate. Any leftover ingredients are used to create muesli, a favorite among the toddlers in Shah's household. It's exciting to see how Shah's vision has come to life, offering people a healthier and enjoyable alternative to traditional sweets.\n\nThese are just two examples of the incredible women who are changing the world through their businesses. At Shopify, we are committed to supporting and empowering women-led enterprises, not just during Women's History Month, but throughout the year. Join us in celebrating these remarkable women and their contributions to their respective industries. END"}

According to data from Shopify, 1.81% of black entrepreneurs believe they must push past the noise of racism and stigma to succeed. Additionally, 61% acknowledge the difficulty in finding access to capital, and 83% feel that now is their time to shine.\n\nAt Shopify, we recognize the importance of diverse voices in commerce, both for businesses and consumers. However, we understand that our current commerce landscape is not equitable for all. Imagine the incredible impact if every aspiring entrepreneur had the resources and support they needed to thrive. The potential for generational wealth creation and life transformation is immense.\n\nTo address these issues, we recently conducted a survey and interviews with over 500 black entrepreneurs across North America. Our research study, \"In Pursuit of Equitable Commerce: Insights on Black Entrepreneurship in 2023 and Beyond,\" sheds light on the barriers that black-owned businesses still face.\n\nAccess to capital, on fair terms, is crucial for black entrepreneurs. While there has been increased public support for black businesses in recent years, securing loans and investments remains a significant challenge for 61% of entrepreneurs. Even grants specifically meant for black businesses are difficult to obtain for nearly 60% of black entrepreneurs. Many resort to personal savings, costly credit cards, and hard-to-access grants to keep their businesses running. Easier access to financing and better loan terms emerged as the top priorities for these entrepreneurs.\n\nThe inequity in our commerce system comes at a high cost for the economy. Providing more financial resources and mentorship to black entrepreneurs could unlock selling opportunities and drive the economy by an estimated $190 billion. Shopify's data reveals that 78% of black business owners struggle to find customers who are not black. Empowering them with access to digital platforms and service providers would expand their advertising avenues.\n\nTo support black entrepreneurs, we have partnered with the non-profit organization Operation HOPE to create one million new black-owned businesses (1MBB) by 2030. We acknowledge the challenges faced by black entrepreneurs and their determination to succeed despite an uneven playing field. Over half of the entrepreneurs surveyed (56%) agreed that they must work harder and smarter to achieve their goals. They understand the importance of ignoring the background noise of racism and stigma. While they face barriers, they refuse to let them prevent their success. In fact, 83% believe that now is their time to shine, and 68% express optimism about their business growth potential.\n\nBrandon Davenport, Head of Equitable Commerce for Shopify, highlights the increased support for black businesses due to the public's awareness of social justice movements like Black Lives Matter. He encourages aspiring entrepreneurs to seize the moment and turn their ideas into reality.\n\nAt Shopify, we firmly believe that entrepreneurship should be inclusive for all, and it has the power to inject billions into the economy. Our research indicates that 59% of entrepreneurs prefer taking control of their businesses independently, while 41% seek expert guidance. Our Equitable Commerce initiative aims to create an ecosystem that provides access to capital, expert mentors, and unique selling opportunities.

While stopping emissions alone won't be enough, we recognize that there is still a significant amount of carbon in the atmosphere. We believe that no single solution can solve this problem on its own. That's why we are dedicated to scaling carbon removal technologies and putting in the necessary work.\n\nSince we introduced our sustainability fund in 2019, we have been actively investing in carbon removal initiatives to support the growth of this emerging industry. Today, we are thrilled to announce that, together with Stripe, we are investing $11 million in carbon removal from six new companies: Arbor, Captura, Carbon to Stone, Cella, Crew, and Inplanet. This marks an exciting development in our efforts to reverse climate change, and we are inspired by the caliber and number of new companies entering the market.\n\nThrough these investments, we are providing these companies with the opportunity to demonstrate their impact and expand their operations. With the addition of these six new partners, Shopify has now backed a total of 28 companies. You can learn more about each of these new partners below.\n\nThese recent investments are just one part of the important work we have been doing this year to accelerate the carbon removal market. In 2022, our sustainability fund added nine new businesses to our portfolio, helping them bring their visions to life and increase adoption of their offerings. Through our fund activities, we have helped multiple companies raise over $50 million in capital and significantly expand their workforce, enabling them to grow their carbon removal capacity by over 1000x.\n\nIn the spring, we launched Frontier, an advance market commitment (AMC), alongside Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability. As founders of Frontier, we committed to investing a combined $925 million in carbon removal by the end of 2030. This commitment stands as a signal to innovators, investors, and project developers that there is a viable market for carbon removal, and we must all work together to scale the industry.\n\nIn June, we released Planet, an app that enables Shopify merchants to offset their shipping emissions. Planet calculates the estimated shipping emissions for each order, and merchants can fund the same carbon removal companies supported by Shopify to neutralize these emissions. Since its launch, over 8,000 Shopify merchants have used Planet to offset the shipping emissions of more than six million orders, resulting in over 5,000 tonnes of carbon removal.\n\nTo further support the adoption of carbon removal, we recently published a comprehensive guide called \"Buying Carbon Removal, Explained.\" This guide covers everything from researching suppliers to establishing carbon removal contracts and addressing concerns from finance teams. We are committed to generating demand for carbon removal, enabling new companies to prove their impact and scale, and investing millions each year to drive down future prices.\n\nI recently had the privilege of speaking about these initiatives at the TED Countdown London session.

It's clear that shoppers are looking for products that are durable and long-lasting, while businesses are eager to connect with customers across various channels. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards climate-conscious shopping on a large scale, and brand loyalty is up for grabs.\n\nAs we prepare for the upcoming 2022 Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend, a time when millions of shoppers purchased from independent brands on Shopify last year, we surveyed over 24,000 consumers and 9,000 small and medium-sized businesses worldwide. Our goal was to understand how the rising cost of living affects spending habits and industry trends. The results were loud and clear: both businesses and shoppers are planning to be more thoughtful, conscious, and connected this holiday shopping season.\n\nThis year, expect to see consumers making more intentional purchases. There is a significant increase in climate-conscious shoppers who actively seek out brands with sustainable practices. Businesses, on the other hand, are strategizing for a successful Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend by reaching customers through multiple platforms, including social media, in-store, and everywhere in between. This event is not just a weekend, but a season that represents the pinnacle of commerce throughout the year. Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify, emphasized the importance of selling wherever customers spend their time to build strong relationships and secure their loyalty.\n\nConsumers have made their motto clear this year: quality over quantity. A staggering 76% of those surveyed expressed a desire to invest in higher-quality products that will withstand the test of time. Despite reducing their spending over the past few months, 57% of consumers plan to spend as much or more this Black Friday Cyber Monday compared to last year. This is a promising sign for businesses worldwide, as 75% of them are planning to offer even better deals during this weekend.\n\nIn response to the economic challenges faced by consumers, businesses are finding innovative ways to cater to their needs without compromising on quality. For example, Taylor Morris Eyewear is offering more budget-friendly options like subscription-based prescription glasses and adapting existing lenses instead of selling entirely new frames. This demonstrates their commitment to accessibility while addressing customers' changing prescription needs.\n\nConsumers are also mindful of their budgets and the planet. A significant majority (84%) compare prices before making a purchase, with millennials exhibiting a penchant for finding the best bargains. Despite financial constraints, 65% of Gen Z consumers are setting aside more money for a festive holiday season. Additionally, while consumers are prioritizing smaller purchases that bring them joy, sustainability remains a non-negotiable factor. Globally, 40% of shoppers are willing to pay extra for climate-conscious products, and 43% prefer buying from brands with sustainability practices. This presents an opportunity for businesses as word-of-mouth recommendations increase when customers know that a product is environmentally friendly.\n\nFurthermore, shoppers are investing more time and effort into researching brands' environmental commitments, focusing on recyclable packaging and supporting local businesses to reduce their environmental impact.\n\nIn summary, Shopify's Black Friday Cyber Monday survey highlights the evolving preferences of consumers and the strategies of businesses. Shoppers are looking for products that last, while businesses aim to connect with customers across multiple channels. Climate-conscious shopping is gaining momentum, and loyalty to brands is up for grabs. By understanding these trends and aligning with consumer values, businesses can tap into the potential of a successful holiday shopping season. END"}

However, for tech companies, it can be a bit more complicated. Typically, the process involves extending a job offer, the employee accepting it, and then being paid according to the agreement. Unfortunately, this often results in a confusing mess of paystubs, equity portals, and benefits portals.\n\nAt Shopify, we realized that this outdated system no longer made sense. We saw an opportunity to revolutionize compensation and create a better story. That's why we developed Flex Comp, an approach that changes how we reward talent, not just within Shopify, but beyond as well.\n\nFlex Comp is built on three key elements: agency, clarity, and impact. We believe that employees should have agency over their total reward package. Why should a company decide how much should be in cash or equity? Now, our employees have the power to choose how they want to allocate their rewards. Whether they want to save for a house or focus on their career growth, they have the flexibility to make those decisions. We've also eliminated the one-year cliff on equity, so vesting begins immediately. And, to accommodate life's changes, we offer allocation windows a few times a year, allowing employees to adjust their choices as needed.\n\nClarity is another crucial aspect of Flex Comp. In the past, understanding how much you earned was a tedious process, involving multiple sources of information and complex calculations. With our user-friendly design, all aspects of total rewards are clearly laid out in one place. Now, employees have a simple and straightforward way to understand their pay.\n\nLastly, we believe that rewards should be tied to our mission, not external factors like market value or world events. As employees contribute to our mission and advance in their careers, their compensation will grow accordingly. We have a vision for what can exist, and we are committed to building it.\n\nDeveloping Flex Comp was no easy task. We had to navigate industry-wide challenges, such as compensation tied to market value and salary disparities across different locations. However, we embrace challenges at Shopify. We set a bold vision and then work tirelessly to make it a reality. Our dedicated team, consisting of individuals from various departments, came together to bring this massive overhaul to life. Their hard work and commitment paid off, and we now have a system that works for all employees, regardless of their roles, locations, or unique needs. And we continue to innovate and improve, with room for future enhancements.\n\nAt Shopify, we believe in rewriting the story of compensation.

Shopify Capital has just launched in Australia, offering a fantastic opportunity for thousands of merchants to access quick and easy funding of up to $2.5 million AUD. This funding will enable businesses to accelerate their growth, expand into new markets, and prepare for the upcoming peak sales season.\n\nWe understand that the current business landscape can be challenging, with concerns about inflation, consumer spending, cash flow, and supply chain issues. However, now more than ever, it's crucial for businesses to remain agile and explore new ways to generate revenue and foster growth.\n\nAs we approach the peak sales season, Australian merchants are busy preparing their businesses by ordering inventory, planning campaigns, organizing shipping, and hiring talent. However, securing timely funding for these investments is often one of the biggest hurdles for entrepreneurs.\n\nAccording to Shopify research, 62% of Australian merchants are comfortable seeking funds to invest in their business. However, two-thirds (67%) are deterred by high interest rates, and more than half (53%) are put off by lengthy application processes and timeframes. Traditional lenders often require business owners to navigate complex procedures, adding unnecessary stress and obstacles.\n\nBut with Shopify Capital, things are different. There's no need to go through a lengthy application process, no personal credit checks, no equity taken from your business, and no need to provide cash flow projections. Instead, merchants receive funding offers up to $2.5 million AUD through the same Shopify platform they already use to run their store.\n\nAt Shopify Capital, we have a team of experts who review data-informed and machine learning models to ensure that merchants receive the funding they need to grow their business. Once approved, funds are deposited in as little as two business days, allowing merchants to invest in talent, inventory, and marketing to maximize growth or bridge cash flow during seasonal dips.\n\nThink of Shopify Capital as the missing piece of the puzzle that traditional lenders can't provide. We understand the urgency of your funding needs and aim to provide support when you need it most - now, not months from now.\n\nRepaying the funding is simple and flexible. Instead of dealing with compounding interest rates and hidden fees, merchants repay based on an agreed fixed percentage of their daily sales. This approach lowers cash flow risks and removes the uncertainty often associated with traditional loans.\n\nThere's no set time limit for repayment either, as merchants pay back the funding based on their sales. This payment structure ensures that repayments flex with your business, giving you the peace of mind to focus on growing your enterprise.\n\nSince our launch in 2016, Shopify Capital has provided over $3.8 billion USD in funding to tens of thousands of entrepreneurs in the US, UK, and Canada. In the past 15 months alone, our total funding has increased by an impressive 90%. Merchants who have received funding through Shopify Capital have experienced an average sales increase of 36% in the following six months compared to their peers.\n\nOne success story is Tracey Jewel, the manager at Batherapy. With the help of two rounds of funding from Shopify Capital, Tracey transformed her business from selling online-only DIY bath kits to creating in-studio bath and body product workshops across Perth. She shared her experience, saying, \"Accessing funding has traditionally been a hassle, but now we can quickly access it through the same platform we use to run our business. Repayments are automatically made as a portion of each sale, so we can focus on our growth without worrying about repayment schedules.\" The first round of funding bolstered supplies to support the opening of their first studio space in inner-city Perth, and they have since repaid the initial round and accessed an additional round to expedite the opening of three new studios across the city.\n\nSo, if your business is in need of funding to fuel growth and seize new opportunities, Shopify Capital is here for you. Experience the ease and support of accessing funds through our platform, and let us help you take your business to new heights. END"}

A new partnership between YouTube and Shopify is bringing together commerce and community in a seamless way. This means that creators and merchants can now combine their efforts to reach even more customers around the world.\n\nWith YouTube Shopping on Shopify, merchants can easily integrate their online stores with one of the largest entertainment platforms available. And with over 2 billion monthly logged-in users on YouTube, the potential for reaching a wide audience is incredible.\n\nBut what exactly does YouTube Shopping offer? Well, Shopify merchants can now sell their complete range of products in three different ways. First, through live streams, where merchants can tag and pin products for viewers to see while they enjoy the stream. Second, through videos, where a curated list of products is displayed below on-demand content. And finally, through a store tab that will be added to a merchant's YouTube channel, showcasing their entire selection of products.\n\nThe partnership between Shopify and YouTube is a game-changer for both merchants and creators. It allows them to connect with consumers, build their businesses, and share their stories in a powerful way. By integrating their online stores with YouTube, merchants have the opportunity to meet their customers and viewers where they are.\n\nAnd the benefits don't stop there. Shopify acts as a retail operating system for merchants, ensuring that product details like names, images, pricing, and shipping are always up-to-date across channels. If a product sells out, it's automatically removed from YouTube. Merchants can also easily track the performance of their live and on-demand videos, giving them valuable insights into their multichannel sales.\n\nFor select eligible merchants in the U.S., there's even an option for on-site checkouts on YouTube, so consumers can make purchases without leaving the platform. This makes the shopping experience even more convenient and seamless.\n\nThis partnership between Shopify and YouTube is a great opportunity for independent brands in the creator economy. Commerce today is all about being multichannel, and YouTube is one of the most influential channels out there. By expanding the boundaries of direct-to-consumer commerce on YouTube, Shopify is opening up new possibilities for creators and merchants alike.\n\nCreators have long been building businesses around their YouTube content, and now they can easily reach their audience with their own products. This is a big step forward for the creator community and for shoppers who are increasingly turning to YouTube for their shopping needs.\n\nOverall, this new partnership between Shopify and YouTube is an exciting development in the world of commerce and content creation. It brings together two powerful platforms to create a seamless and engaging shopping experience for users. So get ready to shop and discover new products directly on YouTube! END"}

This internet-native approach revolutionized online shopping and gave rise to the global direct-to-consumer (D2C) phenomenon.\n\nNow, we are about to revolutionize commerce once again with the introduction of Shopify Editions. This is our new showcase of products, featuring new launches and improvements across our entire platform. With the Summer '22 Editions, we are ushering in a new era of commerce called connect-to-consumer (C2C). We pioneered the D2C movement by giving entrepreneurs a direct line to consumers, and now we are paving endless pathways for merchants to build their businesses.\n\nOur Summer '22 Editions includes over 100 product updates, showcasing the speed of innovation and the breadth and depth of what we have developed across online storefronts, offline experiences, web3, social commerce, checkout, and much more. We have exciting new releases that help merchants sell wholesale, take advantage of social commerce, strengthen their community, and expand offline. Let me give you a snapshot of some of our featured products.\n\nConnecting with consumers is not just limited to one-to-one interactions. Merchants have a world of opportunity when they connect with other businesses to sell wholesale. This opportunity is massive, with billions of untapped revenue potential. That's why we are introducing B2B on Shopify. B2B on Shopify makes it seamless for Shopify Plus merchants to sell to other businesses on the same platform they use for D2C. No more spreadsheets, one-off invoices, or manual data entry. We have also partnered with ERP providers like NetSuite, Brightpearl, and Acumatica to integrate merchants' essential data with our B2B solution.\n\nFor a merchant's wholesale customers, B2B on Shopify provides a similar online store experience that consumers love, but optimized for business buyers. It comes with tools that make it simple to purchase products in bulk. We have developed a checkout with payment flexibility tailored for B2B transactions. Merchants can set customer-specific prices at fixed rates or discounted retail prices for all their products. It's the familiar and loved Shopify experience, but tailor-fit for wholesale.\n\nNow, let's talk about tokengated commerce. NFTs are generating a lot of buzz these days, and we believe the most exciting experience is not just selling NFTs but activating them. That's where tokengated commerce on Shopify comes in. Our merchants have already built passionate communities and loyal fans for their brands, and now tokengated commerce offers a whole new way to deepen those connections and reward true fans and VIPs. By connecting their crypto wallets to a Shopify online store, consumers-turned-fans can use their NFTs to unlock exclusive products, perks, and experiences. Furthermore, merchants can activate Shopify tokengated commerce experiences everywhere, from online to mobile to physical retail through point of sale (POS) systems.\n\nWe are committed to breaking down barriers for entrepreneurs, making commerce accessible and exciting for everyone.

Maskne, scientifically known as acne mechanica, is a type of acne that occurs due to excessive friction, heat, and rubbing on the skin. It is commonly experienced by athletes who have to wear masks and straps for long periods. However, with the arrival of COVID-19, maskne has become more common as wearing face coverings has become a necessary part of our daily lives.\n\nWhy does your mask cause breakouts? Acne bacteria, known as propionibacterium acnes or p. acnes, naturally exists on everyone's skin. Although it may not sound pleasant, these bacteria is a normal part of our body's natural microbiome. Normally, acne bacteria coexists peacefully with other bacteria, but when it starts to colonize in the pores and hair follicles and feed on dead skin and oil, it can lead to an acne breakout. Sweating and the humidity created by breathing into your mask provide an ideal environment for p. acnes bacteria to grow. Masks can also increase the risk of clogged pores and breakouts because they act as a barrier, not allowing the skin to \"breathe\" and trapping oil, sweat, dirt, and makeup in the pores. Prolonged mask-wearing can cause friction on the skin, leading to inflammation and irritation, making it more susceptible to infection. All of this can be detrimental to maintaining clear skin.\n\nSo, what can you do to prevent maskne? \n1. The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings to reduce the spread of COVID-19 to others. Opt for 100% cotton masks as they are effective and breathable, reducing sweat and moisture on the skin.\n2. Wash your masks frequently to remove sweat, oil, and dirt buildup.\n3. Reevaluate your skincare routine and products. The occlusion caused by the mask can deliver active ingredients like retinols and acids deeper into the skin, increasing the risk of compromising your moisture barrier and causing irritation and breakouts. Only apply such products at night and reduce or stop usage if irritation occurs. A simpler skincare routine might be more suitable if you have to wear a mask for extended periods.\n4. Keep your skin well-moisturized to decrease friction from the mask.\n5. Take a break from wearing makeup. Since the lower half of your face will be covered by the mask, consider skipping foundation or concealer in that area to eliminate one more factor that could clog your pores. If you still desire coverage, try using a tinted moisturizer.\n6. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser every night to remove makeup, oil, and dirt that have accumulated throughout the day. Follow it up with a hydrating moisturizer.\n7. When required to wear a mask for a long time, keep several clean masks with you and switch them out periodically.\n8. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Hydration is essential for healthy skin.\n9. Reduce stress whenever possible. Stress is one of the main triggers for acne, and acne itself can cause more stress, creating a vicious cycle. Finding ways to decompress is crucial, especially during this challenging time, for both your skin and overall health.\n10. If you experience rashes, allergic reactions, or severe acne, consult your dermatologist for professional advice and assistance.\n\nBy following these tips, you can proactively prevent and manage maskne, ensuring your skin stays healthy and clear.

Laser tattoo removal is a safe and non-invasive procedure that uses laser energy to break down the ink particles in a tattoo. This allows your body's natural processes to eliminate the ink. During the procedure, pulses of light are sent through the top layer of skin and into the tattoo, where they are absorbed by the ink particles. This causes the ink to break down into smaller pieces, which your immune system can then remove naturally.\n\nIf you're looking for a laser tattoo removal near you, you have several options to consider. Dermatologists and plastic surgeons are skin care specialists who can treat a wide range of skin conditions, including tattoo removal. They have access to various tattoo removal devices and can choose the best treatment or combination for your specific needs. Tattoo removal clinics specialize in removing tattoos using devices like the Lutronic Hollywood Spectra. These clinics have experienced providers who focus solely on tattoo removal, which many people find beneficial. They usually offer a range of laser tattoo removal services and can help you select the right treatment plan. Med spas are wellness centers that often provide laser tattoo removal. They offer a relaxing and comfortable environment for tattoo removal and may also offer other aesthetic treatments that align with your interests.\n\nHow much does laser tattoo removal cost? The cost of tattoo removal can vary depending on factors such as the size and location of the tattoo, the color of the ink, the type of laser used, and the professional performing the procedure. On average, a single laser tattoo removal session can cost between $200 and $500 or more. Multiple sessions are usually required, spaced 6-10 weeks apart, for complete removal. The total cost will depend on the size, depth, and color of the tattoo, as well as the number of sessions needed. The number of treatments required varies based on factors like the color and size of the tattoo, the age of the tattoo, the depth of the ink, the type of ink used, and the patient's skin type. Generally, most people need between 5 and 10 treatments to achieve more than a 90% reduction in the appearance of tattoo ink. However, some individuals may require more or fewer treatments. It's important to note that complete removal of a tattoo may not always be possible, and there could be some residual ink or discoloration after treatment.\n\nIt's crucial to keep in mind that laser tattoo removal does not guarantee complete removal, and some residual ink or discoloration may be present. The success of the procedure also depends on your skin type, the tattoo's location, and its age. Nonetheless, laser tattoo removal is generally safe and effective. It has become a popular alternative to traditional methods like surgical excision or dermabrasion. END"}

One common complaint that I come across is melasma, which is a condition characterized by dark spots on the skin. These spots often appear on the forehead, cheeks, and upper lip. Unlike other forms of hyperpigmentation, melasma is worsened by sunlight and is hormonally-induced, making it quite challenging to treat effectively.\n\nWho is at risk of developing melasma? While up to 33% of the population can be affected by melasma, women are at a higher risk than men. In fact, women make up about 90% of the 33%. Pregnant women, in particular, are more likely to experience melasma, commonly known as the \"pregnancy mask.\" Fortunately, this typically fades after pregnancy. Melasma is most prevalent during a woman's reproductive years, usually appearing between the ages of 20 and 40. Women who take oral contraceptives also face a higher risk due to the hormones they contain. Additionally, individuals with darker skin types and those with hypothyroidism may be more prone to melasma due to increased melanin or hormonal imbalances, respectively.\n\nWhy does melasma seem to fade and then return? For anyone who has observed their melasma improve only to see it come back, the frustration is all too familiar. Due to the many contributing factors and the significant role of hormonal fluctuations, melasma is notoriously difficult to control. Many people experience a rebound in their melasma during the summer months when the condition is exacerbated by heat and sun exposure, while it may fade in the winter. Nevertheless, regardless of the season or weather, it is crucial to wear broad-spectrum SPF every day to minimize the negative effects of UV radiation.\n\nI wear SPF daily, but is there anything else I can do to improve my melasma? As we bid farewell to the last days of fun in the sun and approach the holiday season, many people are seeking laser treatments to fade their melasma and enhance their overall complexion. Thankfully, the Lutronic Hollywood Spectra laser has earned FDA clearance for treating melasma and is safe for all skin types. Not only will this laser improve your melasma, but it also stimulates collagen production, resulting in brighter, clearer skin with reduced fine lines and wrinkles!\n\nIf you are dealing with melasma, it's important to know that you're not alone. Although there is no cure for melasma, it is treatable and controllable. END"}

Our nuclear plants have been powering Canadian grids since the 1960s, but our involvement in nuclear science and technology began even earlier. Canadian Nuclear Labs in Chalk River, Ontario, has been leading the way in designing, building, and experimenting with nuclear reactors since World War II. Through continuous use and refinement, we have developed a strong industry with highly skilled individuals.\n\nAt Canadian Nuclear Labs, our ongoing research focuses on how our nuclear science and technology can benefit people worldwide. We strive to save lives and improve the quality of life for all. \n\nWhen it comes to our current energy mix, more than three-quarters of Canada's electricity grid is generated by nuclear power and renewable sources like hydroelectricity. This combination is carbon emission-free and helps us build a clean, low-carbon future. Nuclear energy is clean, reliable, and affordable, making it an essential component of a sustainable energy landscape. Prominent scientists and environmentalists recognize nuclear power as one of the few reliable sources that can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nIn fact, the world's use of nuclear power already reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 2.5 billion tonnes each year by avoiding fossil fuels. As nuclear power continues to work in partnership with other low-carbon sources, we can further decrease the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Nuclear power stations are the workhorses of our power grid, providing continuous and reliable electricity production. This steady supply allows for the expansion of other forms of power generation that may operate more intermittently.\n\nNot only is nuclear power cost-competitive with other forms of electricity generation, but its fuel costs are low and stable. In the grand scheme of nuclear power, fuel costs make up a small proportion of the total expense. This affordability makes nuclear energy a valuable asset in enabling the growth of renewable energy sources.\n\nTogether, nuclear power, wind, and solar can help us create clean and carbon-free electricity grids. Since electricity on the grid must be used immediately after it is generated, this partnership ensures our power needs are met, even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Canada's nuclear reactors provide baseload power, guaranteeing a steady supply of electricity to the grid. This stability creates room for renewables to respond to changing demand for electricity.\n\nExciting advancements in nuclear reactor designs are on the horizon. These improvements will enhance the capability for load following, meaning reactors will adapt to changing electricity demand throughout the day. This increased efficiency will further complement renewables, eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels to compensate for electricity supply and demand discrepancies. Such progress is critical in our fight against climate change.\n\nCanada has always been a leader in nuclear science and technology, and we are well-positioned to continue this legacy in the development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMR). With over 60 years of innovation, a world-class regulator, and a robust domestic supply chain, our nuclear industry has the potential to capture a significant share of the emerging global market. Experts estimate that this market could be worth $150 billion per year by 2040.\n\nBy embracing nuclear power and advancing SMR technology, Canada can play a crucial role in shaping a greener, more sustainable future while also fueling economic growth.

However, there is a solution that is both reliable and affordable - nuclear power. It is the only energy source that can easily be expanded while also being low-carbon. By turning to nuclear power, we can effectively combat climate change.\n\nTo achieve our climate goals, we must stop releasing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. There is a set limit, or carbon budget, for how much more carbon dioxide we can emit to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming under 1.5 °C. Currently, burning fossil fuels contributes about 37 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year. To meet our climate goals, we must quickly increase our use of carbon-free energy sources, such as nuclear, solar, and wind power.\n\nCountries around the world have committed to limiting their total carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement. However, some countries, like Germany and China, have struggled to meet these commitments. Even Canada is not on track to reduce its carbon emissions by 30% between 2005 and 2030. It is clear that we need to prioritize greener energy options to stay within the carbon budget.\n\nThere are three main strategies to achieve this. First, we need to reduce overall energy consumption, which has shown some success. Second, we should explore carbon capture technologies, like the one being used in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. However, these strategies alone are not enough to achieve a carbon-neutral future. We also need to transition away from fossil fuels and replace them with low- and zero-emission sources of energy generation.\n\nRenewable energy sources like solar, wind, and tidal power have made significant progress in the past decade, leading to more affordable prices. However, they still make up only a small portion of Canada's total power generation. Hydroelectric power is a zero-emission option that Canada has already utilized extensively, but there are limits to damming suitable locations. Nuclear power, on the other hand, does not emit greenhouse gases during operation and has a smaller land footprint compared to other options. Canada has an abundant supply of uranium and numerous potential sites for nuclear power plants. Therefore, nuclear power has great potential in our fight against climate change.\n\nWhen considering carbon emissions, it is essential to look at the entire life cycle of energy sources. This includes construction, the supply chain, operation, decommissioning, and disposal. When all these factors are taken into account, nuclear power compares favorably with renewable energy sources and far surpasses fossil fuels. According to the World Nuclear Association, the world's 445 reactors save 2.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Future reactors will be even more efficient, further reducing emissions.\n\nThe province of Ontario in Canada provides a successful example of how nuclear power can significantly reduce carbon emissions. In the past, Ontario heavily relied on burning coal for electricity, causing substantial emissions. However, thanks to their 18 nuclear power reactors, the province was able to eliminate coal from their energy mix by 2014. This switch not only led to cleaner air but also a sharp decrease in carbon emissions, even with a 30% population growth since 1990.\n\nBy embracing nuclear power, we have the opportunity to make a significant impact on climate change. It is a reliable, low-carbon, and expandable energy source that can help us achieve our climate goals. Let's follow the examples of countries like France, Sweden, and Ontario, and transition to a greener and more sustainable energy future. END"}

We have the potential to prosper in the global net-zero economy, but only if we act now and align climate objectives with economic growth and diversification.\n\nIndustrial competitiveness must be a key consideration in our climate strategy as we move towards a net-zero economy. We need to create the best possible environment for investment by offering incentives, clear requirements, and affordable clean energy sources. It is also crucial that we address the influx of carbon-intensive steel into our country if we want to maintain our competitive edge. Canada's steel industry produces the greenest steel in the world, but we cannot afford to lose ground to carbon leakage.\n\nWe have a unique opportunity to build a zero-emission vehicle industry, shaping the future of our industrial sector. Industry and government must work together to set economic and job targets in mining, battery production, and manufacturing, and develop action plans and investment strategies to meet those targets. By doing so, we can secure Canada's position in the global zero-emission vehicle industry.\n\nThe media briefing event also provided an opportunity for the media to connect with leading voices on the transition to a net-zero economy from various organizations. These experts are available for interviews on topics such as climate policy, electrification, zero-emission vehicle supply chains, sustainable finance, and sustainable agriculture. You can find a list of these experts, along with the latest news and events related to the transition to a net-zero economy, on the Ivey Foundation's website. END"}
{"prompt":"green procurement could boost canada-u . s . relations canadian politicians of every stripe now regularly state that a strong economy and a healthy environment can go hand-in-hand . at the same time , the pandemic has led to significant new commitments by governments across the country to increase infrastructure spending , often with a call to “build back better” and greener . this has raised the important question of the role public procurement can play in meeting both our economic and environmental objectives . last month , the c . d . howe institute hosted a policy seminar , in which leaders from labour , industry , government , and environmental groups were invited to discuss procurement solutions that benefit our economy , jobs , and climate . consensus can be hard to build , but we hope this collaboration shows policymakers that sensible solutions are at the ready , and the need for political leadership is now . one key solution is “green procurement” procuring goods and services that have a smaller carbon footprint . governments around the world now have the opportunity to include it in their plans to rebuild their economies from the devastation of the pandemic . with many canadian commodities being among the greenest in the world — including steel , because relatively little carbon is used and emitted in its production — it’s worth considering a system that prioritizes , even normalizes , green public procurement . we believe that doing so will help advance the ambitious climate objectives that are crucial to canada’s net-zero transformation in the coming years . not only would implementing a robust and green procurement framework help to dramatically reduce emissions and reach net neutrality , which governments in canada have promised to do so publicly , it could also strengthen the economic and environmental partnerships between canada and the united states . the biden administration has explicitly tied fighting climate change to creating good union jobs . both the steel sector’s low carbon emissions , and the good , unionized jobs it provides , should give canadian-made steel a clear advantage in u . s . plans . our two countries remain each other’s most important trading partners , with deep integration across supply chains and organized labour . we also share a vision for the climate . there is consensus among us all that more must be done to tangibly take the significant opportunity in front of us . it’s the main focus of the roadmap for a renewed u . s . -canada partnership , which prime minister trudeau and president joe biden launched earlier this year in the interest of advancing their countries’ mutual prosperity . and while canada and the u . s . did launch a greening government initiative in april , canadian officials need to pursue a deeper dialogue with their american colleagues about green procurement in order to strengthen supply chains and protect our strategic advantage , as well as to create and maintain community-sustaining jobs in both countries . for our part , industry and labour groups across the economy are ready to contribute to collective efforts on green procurement . we call on our governments to act on this opportunity and advance necessary progress , knowing it’s a national imperative if we want to ensure long-term competitiveness and success . we also do so because we realize that our national economic and environmental commitments are a culmination of our own pledges , be they the canadian steel producers association members’ aspirational goal to achieve net zero by 2050 , or the united steelworkers’ participation in blue green canada , which advocates for working people and the environment by promoting solutions to environmental problems that also benefit the economy and create good jobs . we are eager for a new vision of green public procurement , because we have an incredible opportunity now , but also an obligation to future generations to leave no stone unturned in the fight against climate change . ->","completion":" Green procurement has the potential to strengthen Canada-U.S. relations. Politicians of all backgrounds now recognize that a strong economy and a healthy environment can work hand-in-hand. The pandemic has prompted governments to make significant commitments to increase infrastructure spending and build back better and greener. This raises the question of how public procurement can contribute to both our economic and environmental goals.\n\nTo explore solutions, the C.D. Howe Institute recently hosted a policy seminar with leaders from labor, industry, government, and environmental groups. We hope that this collaboration demonstrates to policymakers that sensible solutions are readily available, and that political leadership is needed now. One important solution is \"green procurement,\" which involves purchasing goods and services with a smaller carbon footprint. Governments around the world have the opportunity to include this approach in their plans to rebuild their economies after the pandemic.\n\nCanadian commodities, including steel, are among the greenest in the world due to their low carbon emissions. Prioritizing and normalizing green public procurement could help advance Canada's ambitious climate objectives and contribute to its net-zero transformation. Implementing a robust and green procurement framework would not only reduce emissions and achieve net neutrality, but also strengthen economic and environmental partnerships between Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Biden administration has explicitly connected climate action to creating good union jobs. Canadian-made steel, with its low carbon emissions and unionized workforce, should have a clear advantage in U.S. plans. As each other's most important trading partners, Canada and the U.S. share a vision for the climate and recognize the significant opportunity before them. The roadmap for a renewed U.S.-Canada partnership, launched by Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden, places a strong focus on climate action to promote mutual prosperity.\n\nWhile Canada and the U.S. have already initiated a greening government initiative, Canadian officials need to engage in deeper discussions with their American counterparts to strengthen supply chains and protect our strategic advantage. This dialogue is essential to create and maintain jobs that sustain our communities in both countries. Industry and labor groups across the economy are ready to contribute to collective efforts on green procurement. We urge our governments to act on this opportunity and make necessary progress in order to ensure long-term competitiveness and success.\n\nOur commitment to green procurement aligns with our industry's goal of achieving net-zero by 2050 and the United Steelworkers' involvement in Blue Green Canada, an organization that advocates for solutions that benefit both the environment and the economy. We are motivated by the incredible opportunity before us and the responsibility we have two future generations. We must leave no stone unturned in the fight against climate change. END"}

Canada has all the necessary ingredients to become a global leader in low-carbon transportation fuels, including energy infrastructure, sustainable resources, and expertise. However, we currently lack a competitive investment environment compared to the United States, with whom we compete for investment.\n\nFor the past twenty years, the US has been successful in attracting investment in clean fuels through robust programs like tax credits. As a result, they have built a strong capacity for clean fuel production, while Canada has become increasingly reliant on imports. The Canadian Fuels Association (CFA) members are major producers of clean fuels today and have committed to producing even more in Canada since 2020.\n\nHowever, the US IRA, introduced last summer, has raised concerns. This act includes generous production tax credits (PTC) for low-carbon road transportation fuels and sustainable aviation fuel, which significantly tips the scales in favor of clean fuel projects in the US. This will likely lead to more Canadian feedstocks being exported to the US, causing economic losses for Canada and jeopardizing our energy independence. Unfortunately, this comes at a time when CFA members are planning large-scale renewable projects in Canada to help achieve our climate goals by 2050.\n\nOne example of the impact of the IRA is Parkland's recent decision to discontinue plans for a renewable diesel facility in Burnaby, BC. Clearly, without investment parity, more projects are at risk of being delayed or relocated to the US. It is imperative for the Canadian government to respond swiftly, which is why we are urging the introduction of a clean fuel production tax credit in Budget 2023.\n\nThis tax credit would apply to all clean fuels produced in Canada, including ethanol, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and hydrogen. It would provide the necessary certainty for investment, with the credit rate varying based on carbon intensity. This means that the higher the greenhouse gas reductions achieved, the greater the credit value.\n\nImplementing this tax credit would not only bring economic benefits throughout the value chain, from feedstock providers to distribution, but it would also reduce our dependence on imports and create thousands of jobs for Canadians. The economic and climate advantages of clean fuel production in Canada cannot be ignored or risked.\n\nIn a recent speech, Environment and Climate Change Minister Stephen Guilbeault emphasized that the IRA has made the race for innovation in clean technology more competitive than ever before. Our transportation energy sector has been crucial to Canada's economic success for over a century. Now, we have an incredible opportunity to become a world leader in clean fuel production while fulfilling the evolving energy needs and climate goals of Canadians. Budget 2023 is a critical moment, and we must address the IRA to safeguard our economy, energy, and climate security. END"}

This puts them at high risk of malnutrition and disease outbreaks.\n\nThe situation is particularly challenging for women and girls, who face additional obstacles in accessing healthcare due to restrictions on education and workforce participation.

{"prompt":"investing in global health a common objective 23 june 2023 in 2015 , world leaders committed to providing health services for all people by 2030 . in 2023 , the world is only halfway towards meeting the target set by the sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) of achieving universal health coverage by 2030 . more effort , from implementation to investment in health , is needed to meet this globally agreed goal . consider some figures . before the covid-19 pandemic , the world health organization estimated that low- and middle-income countries needed to increase their health spending significantly to reach the health-related sdgs , with an additional us$371 billion annually combined required by 2030 . this funding would allow populations to access health services , contribute to building new facilities and train and place health workers where they need to be . lately , however , a host of additional factors are increasing the need for additional funding to achieve universal health coverage , such as disruptions to health services caused by conflict , climate change and economic instability . it has also been estimated that preparing for future pandemics will require massive investment in the order of us$31 . 1 billion annually , with approximately one-third required from international financing . temporary increases in government spending driven up by the pandemic response contributed a rise on global health spending in the neighbourhood of $9 trillion in 2020 . that is nearly 11% of gross domestic product . public spending accounted for about 63% of this amount . while public spending will remain the main source of health funding , it will be difficult for countries to find the funds required to meet the ambitious goal of universal health coverage . at the same time , the world economy is under strain , as are national budgets . development assistance will also likely feel the squeeze . health services need new sources of funding , and innovative products that can help marshal the resources of the private sector . the challenge is enormous . individual countries cannot solve the health care conundrum on their own . we need global solidarity and collective efforts . for this reason , the african development bank , the european investment bank ( eib ) , the islamic development bank and the world health organization ( who ) are launching a new investment platform to mobilize more impactful and coherent investments to primary health care ( phc ) systems in individual countries and to improve countries’ resilience . we are also channeling resources from other partners , such as the european commission , to remove the risk from these investments and to make the conditions highly attractive for beneficiary countries . as this is a global challenge , the inter-american development bank , the leading source of development finance for latin america and the caribbean , is also considering joining this partnership in view to extending this initiative to the region . why focus on primary health care ?

However, we are currently only halfway towards meeting the target set by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of achieving universal health coverage by 2030. To reach this globally agreed goal, we need to put in more effort, both in implementing healthcare initiatives and investing in health.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that low- and middle-income countries needed to significantly increase their health spending to reach the health-related SDGs. An additional US$371 billion annually is required by 2030. This funding would not only allow populations to access health services but also contribute to building new facilities and training and placing health workers where they are needed.\n\nIn addition to these challenges, various factors such as conflicts, climate change, and economic instability have disrupted health services and increased the need for additional funding to achieve universal health coverage. Furthermore, preparing for future pandemics will require substantial investment, with an estimated US$31.1 billion annually, one-third of which is expected to come from international financing.\n\nThe pandemic response has already led to temporary increases in government spending, which contributed to a rise in global health spending of around $9 trillion in 2020, accounting for nearly 11% of the gross domestic product. However, it will be difficult for countries to find the necessary funds to meet the ambitious goal of universal health coverage, considering the strain on the world economy and national budgets. Development assistance will also likely be affected.\n\nTo address this enormous challenge, we need global solidarity and collective efforts. Recognizing this, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Islamic Development Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO) are launching a new investment platform. This platform aims to mobilize impactful and coherent investments in primary healthcare systems on a country level, improving resilience and overall health outcomes. We are also collaborating with other partners, such as the European Commission, to remove the risk from these investments and make them highly attractive for beneficiary countries. The Inter-American Development Bank is also considering joining this partnership to extend the initiative to Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nWhy focus on primary health care? Because around 90% of essential health services can be delivered through quality primary health care. By bringing health professionals, doctors, and nurses closer to communities and local clinics, we can promote health, prevent diseases, and reduce the need for more costly secondary and tertiary services. Primary health care is crucial in reaching even the most rural and remote locations, serving as the foundation of a country's health system.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its economic repercussions have taught us the importance of investing in health services that can reach everyone, as it is central to national security, development, and prosperity. Solidarity and equity are vital components of any health service solution, and cooperation between multilateral organizations and development banks is key to addressing the challenges we face. By utilizing innovative finance mechanisms and promoting domestic funding, we aim to drive measurable impact and contribute to our shared goal of health for all without pushing countries into unsustainable debt.\n\nWe will officially launch this new investment platform in Paris during the Summit on a New Global Financing Pact on June 22-23, 2023. At this event, we will call for the generation of much-needed finances to combat health inequalities, support the climate transition, and accelerate progress towards the sustainable development goals. Good health and well-being are aspirations shared by the entire world, and to achieve them, countries and institutions must work together. By strengthening our collaboration and promoting cooperation between nations and governments, as well as the private sector, we can make universal health coverage a reality. We invite our partners to join us in this global investment platform. END"}

These incredible individuals are the first to arrive on the scene and work tirelessly to provide relief and support to those affected by conflicts and disasters. They are the lifeline for people who have lost access to necessities, including healthcare. Through their dedication, they provide care, dignity, and hope to those in need.\n\nWe are proud to join the campaign led by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), our trusted partner, in paying homage to these heroes and their important work. This year's theme, \"Delivering No Matter What,\" reflects their unwavering commitment to making a difference.\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the OCHA for their strong leadership and financial support. With their help, the World Health Organization launched an appeal in February for $2.54 billion to continue responding to the needs of the most vulnerable during this unprecedented time of intersecting emergencies.\n\nOur contributions have had a significant impact over the past year. From reaching isolated populations in Haiti to prevent the resurgence of cholera, to delivering COVID-19 vaccines in Sierra Leone and the Solomon Islands, to supporting ongoing response efforts in Ukraine and neighboring countries, and even aiding earthquake response in Turkey, we have made a difference in difficult-to-access areas, including the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nWe want to extend our heartfelt thanks to all our contributors who have enabled the World Health Organization to alleviate suffering and help people thrive. Your support has been instrumental in our humanitarian efforts.\n\nIn Haiti, after experiencing a resurgence of cholera in October 2022, we worked with local authorities and partners to coordinate a logistical operation and strengthen patient care facilities on La Gonâve Island. Through our partnership with the NGO Humanité Inclusion and its Mer Logistique et Urgence Haiti (MERLUH) project, we were able to rapidly deliver essential medical supplies and equipment, supporting the management and treatment of cholera cases on the island.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, a nation still recovering from the Ebola virus, the COVID-19 pandemic posed new challenges in accessing medical care. Despite these difficulties, community nurses and mobilizers tirelessly worked to reach remote communities and villages, ensuring the delivery of vaccines. Nurse Kai and Nurse Koroma, from the Masselleh Community Health Post, traveled long distances over rugged roads to provide vaccines to those in need.\n\nSimilarly, in the Solomon Islands, healthcare workers faced the challenge of crossing rivers and enduring long journeys to reach mountain villages like Kuvamiti. Nurse Rosemary Raikekeni managed a health clinic in Totongo, which served as the closest permanent clinic for many villages in the region. Their dedication and determination were crucial in providing routine healthcare and immunization services to these remote areas.\n\nIn January 2022, WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi established the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership to provide intensified support for vaccine delivery. This partnership aims to ensure that vaccines reach even the most challenging and remote locations, bringing us one step closer to ending the pandemic.\n\nOnce again, we extend our deepest gratitude to all the donors and supporters who have made our humanitarian efforts possible. Your contributions have made a significant impact on the lives of those in need. Together, we can continue to make a difference and create a better future for all. END"}

The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging for increased testing and treatment, warning that if current trends continue, hepatitis could become more deadly than malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV combined by 2040. \n\nHepatitis is a disease that damages the liver and can lead to cancer, causing over a million deaths each year. Out of the five types of hepatitis, B and C are the most dangerous and responsible for most cases and fatalities. While hepatitis C can be cured, only a small percentage of those infected receive the necessary diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, a mere 10% of people with chronic hepatitis B are diagnosed and even fewer receive the lifesaving medicine. \n\nUnder the theme of \"One Life, One Liver,\" the WHO's World Hepatitis Day campaign emphasizes the importance of protecting our liver for a long and healthy life. Maintaining good liver health also benefits other vital organs like the heart, brain, and kidneys, which rely on the liver to function properly. It's disheartening to note that millions of people worldwide are living with undiagnosed and untreated hepatitis, despite having more effective tools than ever to prevent, diagnose, and treat it.\n\nDr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General, stresses the need for action, stating that the organization is dedicated to supporting countries in expanding the use of these tools, including cost-effective curative medications, to save lives and eradicate hepatitis. The WHO will also provide new guidance to track countries' progress towards eliminating hepatitis by 2030.\n\nTo reduce new infections and deaths from hepatitis B and C, countries must ensure access to treatment for pregnant women with hepatitis B, offer hepatitis B vaccines to newborns, diagnose 90% of people with hepatitis, and provide treatment to 80% of all diagnosed cases. It is also crucial to prioritize safe blood transfusions, injections, and harm reduction practices. Vaccination, testing, and treatment are all pivotal in safeguarding your liver from hepatitis.\n\nVaccinating children against hepatitis B is particularly important, as it helps limit the overall spread of viral hepatitis. In 2020, the goal of reducing hepatitis B incidence was the only health target of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that was met on track for 2030. However, many African countries still lack access to the birth dose hepatitis B vaccine. Gavi's recent investment strategy, which includes this vaccine, will revitalize newborn vaccination programs in West and Central Africa, where mother-to-child transmission rates remain high.\n\nWHO recommends testing pregnant women for hepatitis B during their pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission. If positive, treatment should be provided, and vaccines should be given to newborns. However, a WHO report reveals that only half of the countries with a policy actually implement screening and management for hepatitis B in antenatal clinics. Similarly, while 80% of countries have policies for hepatitis B screening and management in HIV clinics, and 65% for hepatitis C, there is still progress to be made.\n\nIncreasing hepatitis testing and treatment within HIV programs is vital in protecting those living with HIV from developing liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. While there has been progress in hepatitis C treatment rates, it is slowing down. WHO advocates for seizing the opportunity of reduced medication prices to accelerate the expansion of treatment. The cost of a 12-week course to cure hepatitis C has dropped from over $90,000 to a mere $60 in low-income countries. Treating hepatitis B costs less than $30 per year or $2.4 per month.\n\nFor those who wish to maintain liver health, the WHO recommends hepatitis testing, treatment if diagnosed, and vaccination against hepatitis B. Additionally, reducing alcohol consumption, achieving a healthy weight, and effectively managing diabetes or hypertension also contribute to liver health. \n\nBy taking action and working together, we can protect our livers and prevent the devastating consequences of viral hepatitis. Let's join forces and make a positive impact on global health. END"}

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a major economic crisis and set back progress on achieving decent work for everyone. While global economies have been slowly recovering since 2021, the road to full recovery is still uncertain and fragile, especially when it comes to improving employment opportunities for all.\n\nAs we reach the midpoint of the 2030 agenda, it's clear that multiple crises are putting significant pressure on the 17 sustainable development goals. According to the 2023 UN World Economic Situations and Prospect Report (WESP), economic growth has weakened in the United States, European Union, and other developed countries, which has had a ripple effect on the rest of the world. The projected world output growth rate for 2023 is only 1.9%, one of the lowest rates we've seen in decades. The growth in real GDP per capita has also declined sharply in 2020, although it has slowly increased since then. However, it is estimated that growth in 2023 will still be slower, falling short of the SDG target of 7%.\n\nThe impact on global employment opportunities has been significant, especially for women and youth. The UN Secretary General's 2023 SDGs report highlights a decline in unemployment rates in 2022, but there are still an estimated 192 million people unemployed globally. Job recovery in developing countries has been slower, with higher unemployment rates compared to pre-pandemic times. Climate change has also created additional challenges for countries trying to achieve productive employment and decent work for all. You can learn more about the impact of heatwaves on work environments in this week's interview.\n\nUnfortunately, the pandemic has also had a disproportionate impact on women and young people in the labor market. While some recovery has been observed, young people aged 15-24 still face difficulties in finding decent employment. In 2022, many young people, particularly young women, were not in education, employment, or training. This is particularly prevalent in areas like Central, Southern, and Western Asia, as well as Northern Africa.\n\nTo achieve SDG 8, it is crucial to have a financial system that not only addresses rising debt and economic uncertainty but also focuses on promoting fair pay and decent work for all young people.

Our assessments of the financial sector are examining the impact of increased borrowing costs and the possibility that central banks may maintain higher policy rates for longer than anticipated.\n\nRecently, there have been interest rate hikes by central banks around the world in order to address the largest inflation outbreak in four decades. Unfortunately, this has created challenges for banks in the United States and Europe. While rate hikes are generally beneficial for lenders, this time some banks experienced losses on bond holdings, including safe US treasuries. This caused concern among customers, leading to withdrawals that were amplified by technology and social media. As a result, a number of banks faced difficulties.\n\nOur financial sector assessment program plays a vital role in our surveillance by closely monitoring risks to financial stability on a country-by-country basis. We also evaluate the resilience of individual countries and whether their financial sector supervision, regulation, crisis management tools, and safety nets adhere to international best practices. Additionally, we stress test potential risks to banks and have recently expanded our risk assessment to include nonbank financial intermediaries like pension managers, insurers, and asset managers.\n\nIt is important to note that our work is taking place during a period of ongoing interest rate increases by central banks, which could lead to borrowing costs remaining higher for longer than expected by investors, businesses, and households. This situation may increase financial stability risks and have a dampening effect on economic growth, as we highlighted in July. Heightened market volatility and the potential for rapid tightening of monetary policy could result in volatility in bond and interest-rate derivatives markets. For instance, the value of safe US treasury securities may decline by up to 30% when yields increase by 400 basis points, which has happened since 2020.\n\nPrior to March, we had been focusing on the risks that shifts in bond markets posed to nonbank financial companies. Many of these companies have substantial investments in bonds and may experience losses in their valuations. Investment funds, in particular, may face rapid redemptions if their customers choose to exit unprofitable funds. While runs are rare for pension and life insurance companies, as policyholders would incur penalties for early withdrawal, companies that employ derivatives and other complex transactions to enhance returns may encounter margin calls if the value of these instruments decreases. We saw this happen to some UK pension funds last year.\n\nThe events of March served as a reminder of the importance of bank runs. Regulatory reforms following the global financial crisis required banks to hold more cash and bonds. Additionally, in many countries, banks have greater access to borrowing from central banks to avoid selling bonds when markets decline. However, in the case of Silicon Valley Bank, these safeguards did not function as intended.

Central banks may choose to maintain higher interest rates for a longer period than originally anticipated. This decision is influenced by investors' positive outlook on inflation and their belief in a gentle economic slowdown. However, this approach could lead to increased financial instability and have a negative impact on growth.\n\nIn recent months, inflation has significantly decreased in the United States and the euro area, primarily due to lower energy and food prices. Year-on-year headline inflation is now at approximately 3 percent in the United States and below 5.5 percent in the euro area. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has not declined as rapidly. Services inflation, in particular, has proven to be resistant to decrease.\n\nAccording to market pricing, investors expect headline inflation to continue decreasing rapidly in the coming quarters. However, some market participants still see potential for inflation to rise, likely due to the persistent core inflation. This viewpoint is reflected in the pricing of inflation options, where investors assign comparable probabilities to inflation either returning to the European Central Bank's 2 percent target or remaining around 4 percent. In the United States, investors believe there is a high chance of inflation exceeding the target at around 3 percent.\n\nDespite continued tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, financial conditions have eased in the United States and the euro area in recent quarters. This easing is a result of investors' positive outlook on price pressures, which has boosted market valuations. However, this poses a challenge for central banks in their efforts to bring inflation back to their 2 percent targets. Traditionally, tighter monetary policy has been transmitted to the real economy and subsequently to inflation through tighter financial conditions. While financial conditions are currently tighter than they were in mid-2021, the recent easing may complicate the fight against inflation by preventing the necessary slowdown in aggregate demand to control inflation pressures.\n\nAnother complication arises from the combination of an extended period of loose financial conditions and a tightening cycle of monetary policy in advanced economies, which began when inflation was already high. This may have weakened the transmission of monetary policy to financial conditions. For example, a large proportion of fixed-rate mortgages with low rates exists in the United States due to refinancings in recent years. Similarly, corporations took advantage of low borrowing costs and ample liquidity to extend their debt maturities. These factors may have reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, as many mortgage holders and companies are only now starting to face higher borrowing costs. This has contributed to the continued strength in labor markets and aggregate demand. It is important to note that other factors, such as structural changes in the labor market or housing markets following the pandemic, may have also played a role.\n\nWhile financial conditions based on financing costs in capital markets have eased, credit extension plays an important role in the transmission of monetary policy, particularly for borrowers who rely on bank lending. Bank credit growth has remained positive in both the United States and the euro area, although the pace of growth has significantly slowed, especially in the latter. Recent loan officer surveys in both regions indicate a considerably slower demand for credit and stricter underwriting standards by banks. This suggests that a further deceleration in bank credit provision may be on the horizon. \n\nDespite the strength shown in recent earnings reports of large banks, with higher interest rates charged on loans boosting earnings while deposit remuneration lags behind the pace of policy tightening, lending survey results suggest that profitability could decrease in the future.

With a population of 11,000 spread across nine islands that are less than five meters above sea level, the impact of this threat cannot be underestimated. \n\nDespite the limited health consequences of the pandemic, Tuvalu has faced a significant economic setback. Economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels, necessary climate adaptation projects have been delayed, fiscal pressures have increased, and outbound migration has clouded the country's growth potential. This makes addressing the risks facing Tuvalu, from climate change to fiscal sustainability, more difficult.\n\nAfter our recent visit to Tuvalu, we have identified a comprehensive set of policies that can help reduce uncertainty and promote private-sector activity and growth. This is important as the public sector currently plays the predominant role in the economy. By raising more revenues and maximizing government spending efficiency, we can promote fiscal sustainability. Fiscal reforms, such as strengthening oversight of spending plans, can also facilitate access to climate finance from donors, which is critical given the immense climate adaptation needs of Tuvalu.\n\nIn addition, reforms to enhance the domestic banking industry's connectivity to the global payments system, deepen trade integration, and invest in human capital through initiatives like scholarships for overseas study, can further strengthen Tuvalu's resilience. A more diversified economy will also help encourage Tuvaluans to utilize their skills within the country, reducing migration pressures.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that while domestic policies are essential for fostering growth in the short term, Tuvalu's long-term prospects rely on collective global action to prevent destructive global warming scenarios. With its existing infrastructure, under a high global emissions' scenario, Tuvalu may become uninhabitable by the end of this century due to rising sea levels. This is not just a threat to Tuvalu, but to millions of people worldwide living in low-lying areas.\n\nUltimately, Tuvalu's climate change plight highlights the urgent responsibility of the global community to intensify efforts in reducing global emissions. By working together, we can build a more resilient future for Tuvalu and other vulnerable regions around the world. END"}

The declaration to eliminate violence against women recognized that such violence violates women's rights and freedoms, and called on countries to work towards eradicating it. However, even after thirty years, women still face the risk of violence in their homes, on the streets, in schools, and at work. Shockingly, it is estimated that one in three women worldwide have experienced intimate partner violence or sexual violence from a non-partner in their lifetime. Gender-based violence also includes the millions of girls who are forced into marriage before the age of 18, as well as the hundreds of millions of girls and women who have undergone female genital mutilation. The negative impacts of this violence are immense, affecting not only the survivors but also their children and communities. It leads to a loss of economic potential and productivity, as well as a decrease in overall well-being. Fear of harassment also limits women and girls' mobility and prevents them from leading healthy and productive lives. The World Bank is committed to addressing this issue and has significantly increased its efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. We have implemented projects in various countries, working closely with local and international organizations, to provide immediate response services, shift community attitudes, and promote gender equality. For example, in Bangladesh, a health project ensures that displaced Rohingya women and girls have access to safe spaces and support services. In Haiti, we support essential services for survivors while empowering women and girls through community-based activities. In São Tomé and Príncipe, we promote safe schools and empower girls through clubs that foster positive masculinity. In India, our transport projects prioritize women's safety in public spaces. In Uzbekistan, we have established referral pathways for survivors of gender-based violence as part of broader labor market reforms. Through our social inclusion and sustainability operations, we are working to prevent gender-based violence at the community level and empower all individuals. In Nigeria, for instance, we focus on improving economic opportunities for women and addressing gender inequality through social capital-building and livelihood support. We use diagnostic tools to identify and shift social norms that perpetuate gender inequality. The World Bank has also released a report that highlights lessons learned from our decade of engagement in gender-based violence prevention and response. We have actively engaged with key actors in various sectors to address this issue, drawing on global knowledge and consulting with local women's groups. In the following sections, we will discuss these initiatives in more detail. END"}

This vision is becoming a reality as African leaders and young people come together with a shared commitment to invest in the continent's potential. Recently, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, there was a sense of excitement and optimism as 18 heads of state, heads of governments, and ministers from 43 countries gathered for the Africa Human Capital Heads of State Summit. They were joined by thought leaders, development partners, and talented young artists, all united in their belief that Africa's economic growth can be supercharged by investing in its young people.\n\nDid you know that Africa is the only continent where 70% of its population is under the age of 30? By 2035, over 400 million young people will enter the working age. This presents an incredible opportunity for Africa's future, but also a challenge that needs to be addressed. Victoria Kwakwa, World Bank Regional Vice President for Eastern and Southern Africa, acknowledges this challenge and urges us to rise up and accelerate progress in building human capital on the continent.\n\nTo tackle this challenge head-on, leaders from 43 countries endorsed the Dar es Salaam Human Capital Declaration of 2023. This declaration prioritizes ambitious investments in health, education, and job creation. The aim is to reduce learning poverty by at least a quarter and improve literacy rates to reach 75% by 2030. By increasing resources from countries and development partners, we can make these targets a reality.\n\nWhile progress has been made across the continent, Africa still faces human capital constraints. Almost 100 million children are out of school and lack the necessary nutrition and stimulation to learn effectively. Additionally, many students attending school are not receiving quality education. In fact, nearly 90% of 10-year-olds in Africa struggle to read and understand a simple text. This means that young people in Africa are missing out on 60% of their productivity potential.\n\nMamta Murthi, World Bank Vice President for Human Development, emphasizes the importance of investing in young people and providing them with quality education and job opportunities. This will require not only financial resources but also political commitment. The summit participants recognized the challenges in prioritizing human capital but agreed that education and health should be the cornerstones of these efforts.\n\nDuring the summit, discussions centered around improving the quality of instruction, particularly in reading and basic numeracy. Teacher training and secondary school completion, especially for female students, were also highlighted. There was a recognition of the need to strengthen the connection between education systems and labor markets. Additionally, investments in healthcare, nutrition, and stimulation were identified as crucial to prepare children for learning. Rwanda's community-driven model of educating low-income parents on caregiving, nutrition, hygiene, and stimulation was praised as an effective and affordable initiative supporting early childhood education.\n\nRealizing the full potential of Africa and achieving the goals of the Dar es Salaam declaration will require collective effort. Governments must lead and make bold policy choices, the private sector must provide skills and create jobs, civil society must drive momentum for change and ensure accountability, and donors and partners must mobilize resources and provide technical support. Together, we can create a bright and prosperous future for Africa, where the dreams of its young and energized population can truly come true. END"}

Governments in Sub-Saharan Africa have swiftly implemented measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Thermal cameras are being used to screen travelers, health agents have been deployed to increase surveillance, and countries have taken prompt action by reducing flights, closing schools and borders, and limiting public gatherings. Many African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is nearing the end of its fight against Ebola, are familiar with these measures.\n\nTo effectively combat the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19, cross-border collaboration and strong solidarity among neighboring countries and the international community are crucial. The 2014 Ebola crisis taught African countries the importance of investing in resilient health systems and effective surveillance mechanisms to handle epidemics. Building on these lessons, a strong response to COVID-19 requires collective effort.\n\nHealth experts in Nigeria and Senegal have shared their perspectives on the actions being taken to curb the spread of the pandemic in Africa and prepare for its impacts. Surveillance and screening play a vital role in containing the spread. In response to the Ebola crisis, the World Bank launched the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement (REDISSE) project, leveraging over $600 million to strengthen health systems and support disease surveillance in 16 West and Central African countries. The Institut Pasteur in Dakar became one of the first laboratories on the continent accredited by the World Health Organization for COVID-19 testing. Their team started preparations in January, as they are experienced in handling similar disease outbreaks.\n\nDr. Amadou Alpha Sall, Director-General at the Institut Pasteur, explained that they were assigned the regional role by the World Health Organization. They have trained 25 laboratories, with an additional 18 trained by another institute in South Africa. This has expanded the region's capacity to test for coronavirus, with more than 30 laboratories now equipped to do so. Through the REDISSE program, the Institut Pasteur has strengthened its surveillance system by acquiring more laboratory equipment, including biosafety equipment, to increase testing capacity and ensure safety and quality protocols.\n\nDr. John Oladejo, Director for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), emphasizes the importance of coordination among all partners, both within countries and across borders, to prevent the spread of outbreaks. The World Bank has been supporting the NCDC since 2017 to enhance the country's capacity for disease prevention, detection, and response. When COVID-19 was announced, a technical working group was formed to prepare for the virus. The partners worked together to assess infrastructure, drug schedules, and points of entry where suspected cases would likely come from. Dr. Oladejo shared that when the first suspected case emerged in February, they quickly activated their emergency operations center and strictly followed their incident action plan. The World Bank, UNICEF, WHO, and the NCDC worked as one to ensure a comprehensive response.\n\nThe World Bank, along with other regional partners, is supporting countries to take necessary steps in response to this global threat. Last week, a $14 billion fast-track financing package was approved to assist companies and countries in preventing, detecting, and responding to the rapid spread of COVID-19. This package will strengthen national systems for public health preparedness, including disease containment, diagnosis, treatment, and support for the private sector. END"}

Take the case of Madelyne Castillo, a psychology student at the public university in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Madelyne uses a wheelchair and faces a significant challenge because there are no elevators or ramps available on campus. To attend her classes, she has to rely on the kindness of her classmates to carry her up three flights of stairs. Unfortunately, Madelyne's situation is not unique.\n\nThroughout the region, there are many systems and infrastructure that are not designed to accommodate persons with disabilities. This becomes even more problematic when disasters strike. With natural hazards increasing in frequency and severity each year, it's crucial that our early warning systems and preparedness plans are accessible to all. What happens if these systems rely solely on sound or images, making them inaccessible to individuals with hearing or vision disabilities? And during a disaster, what if the shelters are not wheelchair accessible or do not allow service animals?\n\nAfter a disaster, it is equally important to consult persons with disabilities to ensure that the newly reconstructed infrastructure is accessible. With approximately 85 million people living with a disability in Latin America and the Caribbean, these are the kind of questions we must ask and find answers to.\n\nDisability affects 15% of the world's population, and in Latin America and the Caribbean, it is no different. The United Nations defines persons with disabilities as individuals facing long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that, in combination with various attitudinal and environmental barriers, hinder their full participation in society. Understanding this definition is crucial because it highlights the significance of the interaction between individuals and their environment. By making our environment more accessible and inclusive, we can empower persons with disabilities to participate fully in society.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, disability can result from various causes, such as car crashes, chronic diseases like diabetes, labor-related injuries, and different forms of violence, including gun violence and gender-based violence. Shockingly, women with disabilities are four times more vulnerable to gender-based violence, which can, in turn, lead to disabilities.\n\nPersons with disabilities often face significant challenges in education, health, employment, and poverty rates. In the Dominican Republic, there is a will to employ more persons with disabilities; however, the barriers to education and access to classes make it difficult to meet market demands and job requirements. For example, in Santo Domingo, there are only five buses equipped with ramps for wheelchairs. This means that individuals with disabilities have to rely on the assistance of bystanders to be carried onto other buses. This not only affects their dignity but also adds to the hardships they already face. It is important for us to recognize that persons with disabilities are worthy and capable individuals who deserve equal opportunities.\n\nThe good news is that there is strong commitment from governments in the region to address these challenges. Disabled people's groups are actively engaged with their governments, and countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Ecuador are leading the way in disability inclusion. This regional leadership and engagement demonstrate that progress is being made in creating a more inclusive society for all. END"}

These crises can arise from conflicts, economic shocks, natural disasters, and rising prices of fertilizer and food. Unfortunately, the poorest people are often the most affected by these crises. In 2023, it is expected that the situation will worsen even further. The Global Report on Food Crises 2022 mid-year update predicts that up to 205 million people in 45 countries will require urgent humanitarian assistance. To prevent the reversal of the progress we have made in development and to protect lives and livelihoods, urgent action is necessary. When these crises occur, time is of the essence. The longer it takes to respond, the more severe the crisis becomes and the harder it is to recover from it. That's why crisis preparedness is so important. It involves being able to anticipate, respond to, and recover from major shocks. To promote preparedness, the World Bank, along with the Global Alliance for Food Security and other organizations, is supporting countries in developing and implementing Food Security Crisis Preparedness Plans (FSCPPs). These plans define what constitutes a major food and nutrition security crisis for each country, and they outline the steps, roles, and timelines for responding to such crises. The FSCPPs bring together different elements of crisis preparedness into one comprehensive plan. When a crisis is recognized, the plan ensures that timely and coordinated action is taken across government, humanitarian, and development partners to prevent and minimize the impacts of the crisis. The FSCPPs are guided by seven principles: 1) Governments take the lead in developing and managing the plans, with support from international partners if needed. 2) The plans focus on major food and nutrition security crises rather than localized or limited impacts. 3) The plans are based on reliable and up-to-date information and data. 4) The plans consider the full range of actions and involve all relevant partners to save lives, protect livelihoods, and build resilience. 5) The plans take into account the local context and potential impacts on vulnerable populations.

This update includes new regional poverty data for Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia, and the group of advanced countries for the years 2020 and 2021. We now have sufficient survey data available during the COVID-19 pandemic for these regions.\n\nIn total, we have added 113 new country-years of data, bringing the total number of surveys to over 2,100. As part of this update, we have made the usual changes to the input data. This includes revisions to existing welfare distributions, the inclusion of new welfare distributions, and updates to price, national accounts, and population data used for global poverty monitoring.\n\nOverall, these changes have resulted in minor revisions to the global and regional poverty estimates. Table 1 provides a summary of the revisions between the September 2022 and March 2023 data for the reference year 2019, considering all three poverty lines.\n\nAt the $2.15 poverty line, the global poverty headcount ratio has increased slightly by 0.1 percentage points to 8.5%, which means there are now 659 million people living in poverty, 11 million more than previously estimated. This increase is mainly driven by South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nSimilar limited changes in poverty estimates are observed at the higher poverty lines of $3.65 and $6.85, which are typically used for measuring poverty in lower-middle and upper-middle-income countries. At the $3.65 line, the global poverty headcount ratio has increased by 0.1 percentage points to 23.6%, representing 28 million more people living in poverty. At the $6.85 line, the global poverty rate has increased by 0.2 percentage points to 46.9%, with 44 million more people now living in poverty. These upward revisions are largely driven by South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThis update from the World Bank revises global and regional poverty estimates from 1981 to 2019. Regional poverty estimates are now reported up to 2021, depending on the availability of sufficient data during the COVID-19 pandemic. For Europe and Central Asia, poverty data are reported until 2020, and for Latin America and the Caribbean, data are reported until 2021.

Global poverty has been decreasing since the 1990s, albeit at a slower rate since 2014. Extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions except the Middle East and North Africa, where conflict and fragility have posed challenges.\n\nIn 2019, approximately 60% of the world's extreme poor lived in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, while 81% of the global poor at the $3.65 poverty line lived in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia.\n\nFor more details on the regions covered in the post-2019 estimates, please refer to Figure 1.

With the urgent challenges of environmental degradation before us, there has never been a greater need to equip young people with the tools they need to promote sustainable development.\n\nOne key way to achieve this is through media and information literacy (MIL), which empowers youth with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to navigate the complex landscape of environmental issues and develop green skills that will contribute to a more sustainable future. As we mark International Youth Day, it is crucial to recognize the vital role of MIL in nurturing green skills among young individuals.\n\nBy providing youth with the ability to critically engage with media content and make informed decisions, MIL empowers them to become leaders in sustainable development. Not only does MIL enhance their understanding of environmental issues, but it also enables them to drive change, promote eco-friendly practices, and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come.\n\nGreen skills encompass a wide range of competencies and knowledge that are geared towards environmental sustainability. These skills enable individuals to contribute to eco-friendly practices, develop innovative solutions for environmental challenges, and actively participate in the transition to a greener and more sustainable economy. Areas such as renewable energy, waste reduction, conservation, and sustainable agriculture are all covered by green skills.\n\nMIL serves as a catalyst for the development and promotion of green skills among youth. In a world where information, misinformation, and rapidly evolving technologies abound, MIL equips young individuals with the ability to critically assess and analyze media content, discern credible sources, and make informed decisions. MIL empowers them to sift through the noise, identify reliable information, and gain a deep understanding of environmental issues and solutions.\n\nThrough various media channels, including websites, documentaries, podcasts, and social media, young people can learn about successful green initiatives, cutting-edge technologies, and inspiring stories of environmental stewardship. By developing media and information literacy skills, youth can amplify their impact by sharing accurate and impactful information with their peers, communities, and the wider world.\n\nMedia and information literacy also encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for tackling complex environmental challenges. With MIL skills, young people can analyze data, evaluate policy proposals, and think creatively about sustainable solutions. By critically engaging with information, they can contribute to informed discussions and decision-making processes related to environmental issues, advocating for policies that prioritize sustainability.\n\nMIL empowers young individuals to become agents of change by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Armed with accurate information and critical thinking abilities, youth can identify gaps in the market for sustainable products and services. They can develop and launch green start-ups, creating solutions that address environmental challenges while generating economic opportunities. MIL enables them to navigate the business landscape, connect with mentors, and access resources that support their entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nUNESCO, the leading organization promoting media and information literacy, is a strong supporter and champion of MIL initiatives worldwide.
