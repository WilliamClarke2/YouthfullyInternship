Content happens frequently and consistently.\\n\\nOne of the toughest aspects of an effective content marketing strategy has nothing to do with the substance of what’s being communicated. It has to do with how much and how often you publish content.\\n\\nThe goal is to master the art of volume and consistency. It’s tough to do both, especially just starting out, so I find it best to start with the consistency aspect to start building the habit.\\n\\nIf you’re starting from ground zero on your content strategy, pick one or two avenues you want to focus on first. Let’s say you decide on company blog posts and thought leadership articles from your CEO. Pick an achievable goal based on your team capacity—maybe two 500-word blog posts, and one thought leadership article per week. Stick to that volume for six to eight weeks before implementing any other content marketing strategies.\\n\\nOnce you master that, you can either increase or expand your strategy. To increase is to continue what you’re doing but in greater volume. If your company blog posts and thought leadership articles are performing well, try adding two more blog posts per week and one more thought leadership article per week, or whatever’s manageable on a consistent basis.\\n\\nExpanding is jumping into other types of content like podcasts or video interviews, leveraging other types of material to maximize output. For example, can you think of all the material you can create from one hour-long filmed podcast episode?\\n\\nThe video of the podcast can be uploaded to YouTube, and segmented into tons of small video clips for Instagram and TikTok. The audio can be used to promote as a podcast on Apple or Anchor.FM. The transcripts of the audio can be turned into multiple thought leadership articles or company blog posts, as well as short-form status updates for LinkedIn.\\n\\nOf course, not all companies need to market on Instagram or YouTube, but expanding your strategy is always worth brainstorming internally to set yourself up with a plan to keep content ideas flowing.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, your preparedness is what’s going to keep you publishing on a frequent and consistent basis.']\n"
