However, by listening, adapting, and planning effectively, we were able to successfully navigate the semester with my students. One crucial decision that greatly facilitated my remote teaching experience was preparing a front-loaded syllabus. Although this choice was made prior to the pandemic, I did not anticipate its implications at the time.\n\nThe aim of developing a front-loaded syllabus was to empower students with a wide range of tools early on in the semester, allowing the remaining time for individual project development. This strategy proved to be highly effective for remote teaching. Throughout my years of shaping classrooms through agency, adaptation, and tooling, I have observed that front-loaded classes and workshops tend to yield much better results in many aspects. When combined with a longer exploration process, these classes transform into a teaching formula that cultivates high-quality outcomes.\n\nWhen preparing the syllabus for the 2020 spring semester at MIT's School of Architecture and Planning, I had three key considerations in mind. Firstly, agency plays a vital role in front-loaded classes or workshops. By introducing students to a comprehensive range of material in a short period, they are provided with the opportunity to choose and engage with the material that resonates with them. This sense of agency enables students to become integral participants in the teaching process. It is crucial to ensure that the teaching material is adaptable, allowing students to either easily adapt or align with the dynamics of the classroom.\n\nSecondly, teaching is a bidirectional adaptation. While students adapt to the class and teaching material, instructors must also be willing to adapt to the overall needs and drive of the class. Often, instructors expect students to solely adjust, but both parties need to be active participants for a symbiotic relationship to thrive. A front-loaded class enables both students and instructors to make informed choices and adjustments early on in the semester. By revealing the goals and mechanics of the subject from the start and diving into the material right away, instructors can quickly gauge the effectiveness of their teaching choices. Simultaneously, students can assess whether the class aligns with their learning objectives. Additionally, a fast-paced start helps identify students who may struggle to adapt or may not be suited for the class, allowing for a more refined and engaged group of students.\n\nLastly, fluency is crucial, particularly in classes that involve skill-building components. There are two fundamental tracks instructors can follow in this regard. The first option is to gradually introduce and distribute skill-building sessions throughout the semester, allowing students to learn and digest skills over an extended period. While this approach may be low-stress and low-risk, it can detract from the time that could be dedicated to honing and refining skills. The alternative approach is to front-load the syllabus with skill-building sessions and closely monitor students' progress. While this approach comes with risks, as not all students may be able to keep up with the pace of the class, it significantly increases the chances of achieving breakthrough accomplishments. In a fast-paced setting, students experience a steeper learning curve and become more comfortable with the tools of the class earlier. This accelerated learning process is particularly advantageous for application and creation-focused classes.\n\nThroughout my 15 years of piecemeal teaching, I have had the opportunity to teach a diverse range of classes and workshops, bridging the gap between academia and professional practice. These experiences have highlighted the efficacy of front-loaded scenarios time and time again. Starting with a vertical approach, delving deep into the subject, and gradually expanding horizontally has proven to be highly successful. In my latest teaching adventure, I challenged students to develop a \"design\" that required them to re-think and let go of preconceived notions. This concept was driven by my ongoing exploration of part-whole relationships, which I have explored further in my recent work. By organizing the teaching material into four tracks - presence, function, quality, and the whole - I was able to effectively deploy the curriculum.\n\nIn conclusion, preparing a front-loaded syllabus and fostering agency, adaptation, and fluency have been instrumental in enhancing the remote teaching experience. By empowering students with the freedom to choose and engage with material, actively adapting to the needs of the class, and promoting a swift integration of skills, instructors can create a dynamic and productive learning environment. Through continuous reflection and the application of effective teaching strategies, we can ensure a high-quality education for our students, even in the face of unprecedented challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seaborne: A Practical Guide with Multiple Example Plots\n\nData visualizations play a crucial role in the field of data science. They are powerful tools for exploring variables and understanding the relationships among them. When it comes to delivering results and findings, data visualizations are preferred over plain numbers. In this article, we will explore how data visualizations can be used to analyze the distribution of variables. To do this, we will utilize a widely-used Python data visualization library called Seaborne.\n\nUnderstanding the distribution of variables is essential for interpreting data. For instance, some machine learning models perform better when variables follow a normal distribution. Therefore, understanding the distribution of variables guides our approach to problem-solving. Distributions are also integral to exploratory data analysis. They help us identify outliers, assess skewness, and gain an overview of central tendency measures such as mean, median, and mode. Considering the importance of data distributions, let's now delve into some examples.\n\nFor our examples, we will be using an insurance dataset which can be obtained from Gaggle. The first step is to import the necessary libraries and read the dataset into a Pandas data frame:\n\n```python\nimport NumPy as NP\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborne as SNS\n\nSNS.set(style='dark grid')\n\ninsurance = pd.read_CSV('/content/insurance.csv')\ninsurance.head()\n```\n\nThe dataset contains various measures (features) related to the customers of an insurance company, as well as the corresponding insurance charges.\n\nOne of the types of visualizations we will explore is the histogram. A histogram divides the value range of continuous variables into discrete bins, showing the frequency of values within each bin. Let's consider the example of the \"BMI\" variable:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='BMI', kind='hist', aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nThe histogram above visually represents the distribution of the \"BMI\" variable. We can observe that the distribution is approximately normal, except for a few outliers with values above 50. By using the `displot` function, we can also add a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot on top of the histogram:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='BMI', kind='hist', KDE=True, aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can create just the KDE plot by setting the `kind` parameter of the `displot` function to 'KDE'. In this case, the `KDE` parameter is not needed.\n\nWe can further explore the distribution of a variable based on the categories of another variable. One way to achieve this is by utilizing the `hue` parameter. For example, let's compare the \"BMI\" variable distribution for smokers and non-smokers separately:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='BMI', kind='hist', hue='smoker', aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nTo show the bars side-by-side, we can use the `multiple` parameter:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='BMI', kind='hist', hue='smoker', multiple='dodge', aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nThe `displot` function also allows us to create a grid of plots, which is a highly useful feature. By using the `hue` and `col` parameters in combination, we can generate more informative visualizations. Let's examine the distribution of the \"charges\" variable in different scenarios:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='charges', kind='hist', hue='smoker', col='sex', height=6, aspect=1)\n```\n\nThe figure above demonstrates the distribution of the \"charges\" variable across various settings. It is evident that individuals who smoke tend to have higher charges compared to non-smokers. Additionally, there seems to be a higher ratio of male smokers in comparison to female smokers.\n\nWe can also create two-dimensional histograms to gain an overview of the cross-distribution between two variables. The `x` and `y` parameters of the `displot` function are employed here. Let's consider the example of the \"charges\" and \"BMI\" variables:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='charges', y='BMI', kind='hist', height=6, aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nThe resulting figure displays the joint distribution of the \"BMI\" and \"charges\" variables. The darker regions indicate higher density in terms of the number of data points they contain.\n\nAnother feature we can utilize to enhance our understanding of distributions is the rug plot. This plot adds ticks along the x and y axes to represent marginal distributions. Let's incorporate the rug plot into the previously created two-dimensional histogram:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='charges', y='BMI', kind='hist', rug=True, height=6, aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nBy including the rug plot, the visualization becomes more informative. In addition to the two-dimensional histogram, the rug plot on the axes provides an overview of the distribution of individual variables.\n\nThe `hue` parameter can also be utilized with two-dimensional histograms, providing further insights. Let's examine the joint distribution of \"charges\" and \"BMI\" while differentiating smokers and non-smokers:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='charges', y='BMI', kind='hist', rug=True, hue='smoker', height=6, aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nWe can also create bivariate KDE plots. The following plot is the KDE version of the previously discussed two-dimensional histogram:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='charges', y='BMI', kind='KDE', rug=True, hue='smoker', height=6, aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nThe density of lines in this plot gives us an idea about the distribution. To make it resemble a histogram, we can utilize the `fill` parameter:\n\n```python\nSNS.displot(insurance, x='charges', y='BMI', kind='KDE', rug=True, hue='smoker', fill=True, height=6, aspect=1.2)\n```\n\nScatter plots are commonly used to examine the correlation between two numerical variables. However, they can also provide insights into variable distributions. Seaborne offers great flexibility when it comes to combining different plot types to create more informative visualizations. For instance, the `joint plot` function combines scatter plots and histograms:\n\n```python\nSNS.joint plot(data=insurance, x='charges', y='BMI', hue='smoker', height=7, ratio=4)\n```\n\nThe `joint plot` visualization above offers a combination of scatter plots and histograms, providing valuable information about the relationship between \"charges\" and \"BMI\" variables.\n\nIn conclusion, Seaborne provides numerous capabilities for analyzing data distributions through a wide range of visualizations. By leveraging these tools, data scientists can gain deeper insights into the variables they are exploring. END"}

This model aims to identify which human replies are more engaging than others in order to improve the interactiveness of conversational models. The authors of Dialog RPT addressed this issue by training the model on 133 million pairs of human feedback data, resulting in a ranker that outperforms several baselines.\n\nThe need for such a pretrained transformer model arises from the challenge of creating human-like conversations in AI. With recent advancements in the field, human annotators sometimes struggle to distinguish between human- and machine-generated responses. However, human responses are not limited to being relevant to the context; they can also be interesting enough to elicit a rich listener reaction. On the other hand, chatbots or conversational AI models often produce vague and unengaging comments to prevent the creation of inappropriate content.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, the authors utilize existing human feedback data from online social communities, such as Reddit. They use metrics like the number of replies and up votes (also known as \"likes\") to determine the engagingness of comments after careful normalization and formulation. By training large-scale transformer-based feedback ranking models on a dataset of 133 million pairs of human comments and their associated feedback metrics, the authors achieved superior performance compared to several baselines.\n\nThe feedback metrics mentioned earlier, such as width (number of direct replies), depth (maximum dialogue length after a turn), and uptown (number of up votes minus down votes), cannot be directly used as measures of reply engagingness. Studies have shown that while popularity, measured by uptown, generally increases with quality, posts of similar quality can have very different up vote counts. Hence, the task involves predicting a ranking based on these three separate metrics, along with measuring how human-like the response is.\n\nTo train the model, a contrastive learning approach was adopted. The model is trained on pairs of samples, where one response (r+) is considered better than another response (r-) given the same context (c). The aim is to predict a higher score for the more appropriate response.\n\nFor machine-generated responses, the authors used a model ensemble technique. The probability of joint distributions was utilized to rank the machine generations based on their human-like nature and preference by humans.\n\nTo estimate the correlation between the feedback scores and human response preferences, human calibration was conducted. Human annotators were asked to select the response they would prefer to send or receive for the same context.\n\nThe model used in this study is a 12-layer transformer model based on the GPT-2 architecture, initialized with DialogPTMedium model weights. The training process involved training each model for uptown, width, depth, and human-vs-rand tasks, totaling 354.8 million parameters. The training was conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 4-core GPU with a batch size of 256. Each model took around 70 hours to converge.\n\nThe findings of the study indicate that responses with fewer replies or up votes tend to be less content, while comments that attract more feedback are typically more engaging and lead to longer conversations. The models trained on width data showed good performance on depth prediction, and vice versa, indicating a high correlation between these metrics. However, the uptown label showed less correlation with width and depth, suggesting a complementary relationship between the models.\n\nIn the human-vs-generated task, the authors evaluated the model's ability to distinguish between human and generated responses. A model trained only on human-vs-rand data performed poorly, indicating that the generated responses are contextually relevant and receive higher scores compared to random responses. The feedback prediction models (Dialog RPT) demonstrated higher accuracy in the human-vs-generated task, even though they were not trained on generated responses. This suggests that the ranking models predict that the generated responses from Dialog PT may not be as proactive or engaging as human responses.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors utilized Reddit human feedback data to create a large-scale training dataset and trained the Dialog RPT model on 133 million pairs of human feedback data. This model outperformed several baselines and demonstrated higher human preferences in the evaluation of machine-generated responses.

While not all spiders build webs, these silky homes manifest in various forms, serving multiple purposes such as protecting offspring and aiding in hunting. Spider silk, a material stronger than steel and Kevlar, possesses unique qualities that have captured the interest of researchers seeking to harness its potential in diverse applications. Furthermore, recent studies conducted on spiders in space have shed light on their web-building behavior in the absence of gravity, providing intriguing insights.\n\nBody:\nSpiders have long been admired for their ability to construct asymmetrical webs. Interestingly, the hub, where the webs converge, is typically positioned at a higher level, allowing spiders to benefit from gravity when hunting prey. The question arises: what happens when spiders are placed in a low or zero gravity environment? Scientists were determined to find out.\n\nIn a pioneering study, juvenile golden silk orb-weavers, known for their intricate web-building skills, were transported to the International Space Station. Despite the absence of gravity, the spiders set out to construct webs, albeit with some unique differences compared to their earthly creations. As anticipated, the young spiders' webs exhibited a higher degree of symmetry. However, significant variability in terms of spatial web symmetry was observed.\n\nUpon closer examination, researchers discovered that webs initiated with lights on were asymmetrical, while those started in darkness were symmetrical. Webs constructed under illuminated conditions showcased a hub positioned asymmetrically close to the light source, and the spiders themselves faced away from the light. In the absence of light, the spiders randomly positioned themselves in terms of their gazing direction. This intriguing finding highlights the role of light as a secondary engineering guide for spiders, complementing their instinctive abilities.\n\nConclusion:\nThe study conducted on spiders in a microgravity environment has provided valuable insights into the orientation and behavior of web-building spiders. Contrary to the asymmetrical webs and downward-facing positioning observed on Earth, these spiders demonstrated an ability to utilize light as an additional reference point during web construction and while waiting for prey. These findings not only expand our understanding of spiders' adaptability in unconventional settings but also emphasize the remarkable interplay between biology and physics. This fascinating research showcases yet another testament to the wonders of scientific exploration. END"}

Specifically, the game features two races: humans and orcs, each with their own unique armor, weapons, and skills. Without applying the builder pattern, we would typically define a long list of parameters in the hero class constructor to accommodate these variations, resulting in the need for extensive conditional logic to determine the race-specific attributes. As a consequence, any modifications to the business logic would necessitate rewriting extensive amounts of code, leaving limited room for code reuse.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we turn to the builder pattern. By implementing the builder pattern, we can untangle the problem at hand. We begin by presenting a UML diagram that outlines the solution and move forward with its implementation.\n\nIn this video game hero creation problem, we follow the same approach as the previous example. We initiate the process by focusing on the model or object that necessitates flexible construction. In this case, the hero class comprises properties such as race, armor, weapon, and skills. For the sake of simplicity, these attributes are represented as character strings rather than objects. The hero builder interface is then defined, housing methods for specific builders. Through methods like set armor, set weapon, and set skills, we gradually configure the hero object. Ultimately, the build method finalizes the object's configuration and retrieves the hero object.\n\nOnce the builder is established\u2014either as an abstract class or interface\u2014we proceed to create two specific builders: HumanHeroBuilder and OrcHeroBuilder. In the provided demo code, different strings are assigned based on the respective builders. Notably, each builder's build method returns the constructed object (hero) and resets the object's state to enable the building of additional objects.\n\nCompleting the pattern, we introduce the HeroDirector class, which facilitates the storage of commonly repeated configurations throughout the code. In our presented example, we elaborate on three hero creation setups. The create hero method, for instance, constructs a complete hero by assigning armor, abilities, and weapons. Alternatively, the createherobasic method generates a hero devoid of any equipment. Lastly, to exemplify yet another configuration, we define the createherowitharmor method, which solely assigns armor to the hero.\n\nBy employing the builder pattern in this manner, we effectively address the complexity involved in creating video game heroes with varying attributes.

From mobile device cameras to office attendance systems, the demand for face detection systems has led to the development of numerous online APIs, services, and apps designed to perform this task. Some well-known examples include Firebase ML Kit, Google Cloud Vision, Microsoft Face API, and IBM Visual Recognition.\n\nHowever, for seasoned machine learning developers, training their own models using custom data may be necessary. This could be because the task their model needs to perform differs from the services and APIs offered by tech giants. In such cases, existing datasets may not provide sufficient varied samples, resulting in poor performance in real-world scenarios.\n\nIn this article, we will guide you through a short story on how to collect images from the internet like a professional. We aim to provide an end-to-end solution for this problem. By providing a keyword, you will obtain a .spy file containing cropped and resized images. You can find the Python implementation of this process in the provided Google Cola notebook.\n\nGoogle Image Search is the platform we will utilize to search for the desired images. However, we won't simply download images at random and manually crop faces out of them. Instead, we will employ a web crawler that will systematically download each image from the Google search results and save them on your machine. To achieve this, we will utilize the crawler package, which is readily available in pip and is designed for scraping images from Google.\n\nIn Snippet 1, you can observe that there are additional attributes available for specifying the type, size, and license of the images. Feel free to explore these options if necessary.\n\nOne issue you may encounter is that the downloaded images might be too large. However, for face classification systems, we require cropped and aligned face images, similar to the examples shown below:\n\n[Cropped Face Images]\n\nTo address this, we can utilized lib, a face detection system for Python. Given an image, lib outputs a bounding box that we can use to crop and store the face image separately in a list. Additionally, we can resize the cropped image using PIL (Python Imaging Library) to the required size for our model, such as 224x224 pixels.\n\nSnippet 2 demonstrates how to accomplish this.\n\nAnd there you have it! Your image dataset is now ready for use as a .spy file. If desired, you can visualize the cropped images using Matplotlib, as shown in Snippet 3. The output will provide a visual representation of the cropped faces.\n\nWith this comprehensive approach, you can efficiently collect and preprocess images from the internet for your face recognition tasks.

It was a time when grapefruit for breakfast, slimming shakes for lunch, and meager salads for dinner became the norm. However, their commitment to this diet regimen was short-lived, and had it been in present times, grapefruit might not have been on the menu. This is due to the emergence of the low-carb high-fat (LCHF) diet movement, which has become the most prominent dietary trend of the past decade. LCHF diets encompass a range of variations, such as paleo and keto \u2013 short for paleolithic and ketogenic respectively \u2013 and generally follow the principles initially outlined by Atkins in the 90s, albeit with varying amounts of bone broth and kale. These diets have come to be considered healthy and have been promoted as a potential remedy for diabetes by various sources, from reputable publications like The Guardian to established news outlets like The New York Times.\n\nHowever, it is important to state emphatically that these claims are nothing short of nonsensical. As someone who often delves into the realm of scientific studies and analyzes the pros and cons, the true meaning behind the findings, and the potential discrepancies perpetuated by the media, I feel compelled to shed light on the matter. Let's examine the study in question.\n\nThe study in question was, in fact, a survey. More precisely, it involved surveying members of a Facebook group dedicated to following LCHF diets for diabetes control. A total of 316 participants were asked whether this dietary approach helped them in managing their diabetes, and they responded affirmatively. Yes, you read that correctly \u2013 that was the entire extent of the study. No, this is not a joke. The study's methodology was extremely straightforward, making it unnecessary to delve into the intricacies of bias, statistics, or control groups. Surveys, by their very nature, merely provide a glimpse into people's opinions. The researchers did take the time to confirm these opinions, but whether the reported success of LCHF diets is a genuine phenomenon or simply limited to this small, self-selected group remains undetermined. This study is comparable to asking a group of cyclists whether they believe cycling is beneficial and then sensationalizing the results with headlines proclaiming \"Cycling Cures All Human Diseases, New Study Claims.\" It's complete rubbish.\n\nIn this instance, the media cannot be solely blamed for misrepresentation. Even the scientists involved in the study made some rather peculiar statements. For instance, they claimed that individuals achieved \"exceptional\" diabetes control. However, their basis for making such a statement was solely reliant on self-reported before-and-after blood sugar values. There are numerous known issues with relying on people's subjective responses for accurate data, and thus, concluding that this diet had any effect on blood sugar regulation is nothing more than an unfounded guess.\n\nUltimately, this is yet another tiresome example of how preliminary findings are blown out of proportion. The media distorts the context, presenting the results as groundbreaking when they are anything but. Unfortunately, the phrase \"research doesn't yield substantial conclusions\" does not make for captivating headlines. Regrettably, this pattern continues, as news sources, desperate for attention-grabbing stories, magnify the significance of preliminary research. The popularity of LCHF diets may be on the rise, and some evidence suggests a potential benefit for weight loss. However, there is equally strong evidence that these diets provide no distinct advantage over other forms of calorie restriction. Therefore, if you are living with diabetes, I urge you not to succumb to the hype. Consult your doctor, a far more reliable source of information about diabetes than sensationalist media pieces. It should come as no surprise that the most suitable diet for you is one tailored to your individual needs. END"}

important to take measures to protect yourself from cold germs, the flu, and potentially even COVID-19. Fortunately, there are several plants that can help boost your immune system and provide a defense against illnesses. Many of these beneficial plants can be found right in your own backyard. It's best not to wait until winter to start incorporating them into your routine; fall is the ideal time to locate and utilize these immune-boosting plants. Not only will you be taking proactive steps to support your health, but you'll also have the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of nature during autumn.\n\n1. Pumpkin Seeds: Don't discard your old pumpkins just yet! Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, magnesium, iron, and vitamin E, all of which are essential for enhancing immune function. Consuming just one serving of pumpkin seeds can provide 14% to 42% of the daily recommended intake for these vital nutrients. Additionally, pumpkin seeds possess antifungal and anti-viral properties, promoting cell growth, improving mood, and aiding in quality sleep. You can easily incorporate pumpkin seeds into your diet by sprinkling them on various dishes such as oatmeal, salads, stir-fries, soups, and desserts. Roasted shell-on pumpkin seeds also make for a delightful snack or trail mix addition. Alternatively, you can whip up pumpkin seed butter to enhance smoothies, yogurt, or fruit-based dishes.\n\n2. Peppermint: Peppermint is a prolific plant that can thrive both indoors and outdoors. Its leaves and essential oils contain active components like menthol and Rosmarie acid, which possess antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Peppermint-leaf extract has been shown to combat respiratory synovial virus (RSV) and significantly reduce levels of inflammatory compounds. Moreover, peppermint oil has the ability to eliminate bacteria such as E. coli, Listeria, Salmonella, and various strains associated with pneumonia. To harness the benefits of peppermint, it is necessary to extract the oils and chemicals for use. This can be achieved through various methods. \n\n3. Burdock: Burdock root is rich in immune-boosting vitamins C and E. While it may have a prickly appearance, focusing on the root and removing the prickly heads and pink flowers will provide the greatest benefit. First-year plants are especially desirable. There are various ways to prepare burdock, such as roasting the root, making Indira goo, or stir-frying it.\n\n4. Rose Hips: Next time you encounter roses in your garden, pay attention to the little bulbs left behind after the flowers have bloomed. These are rose hips, the oval-shaped fruit or seed pods of the rose plant. They are a potent source of vitamins C, A, B, E, and K. It's best to harvest rose hips after the first frost, as this concentrates the sugar content and softens them. To fully maximize the nutritional benefits, it is advisable to eat them fresh, as the drying process can diminish vitamin C levels. Before use, be sure to remove the tiny hairs surrounding the seeds. Rose hips can be eaten raw or incorporated into various preparations such as tinctures, teas, jellies, or syrups.\n\n5. Elderberry: Elderberry is a renowned immune system superstar and an excellent addition to any garden. It is important not to confuse elderberries with poke weed; elderberry shrubs are larger and bear more berries. Elderberry tinctures and derivatives have long been used for their preventive and therapeutic effects against colds, flu, and sinusitis. They exhibit anti-viral activity against influenza viruses and herpes simplex. While elderberries are edible, it is advised to cook them to avoid any potential stomach upset, as they contain toxins that can create hydrogen cyanide in the gut. Elderberries can be used to create immune-boosting syrups, tinctures, mead, soda, or even fermented honey. They can also be included in various medicinal herbal tea blends.\n\n6. Cherry Bark: While many of us are familiar with enjoying the cherries themselves, the inner bark of black cherry or choke cherry trees can be utilized as a natural cough remedy, supporting the immune system and alleviating unproductive coughing to promote restful sleep. Foraging for the bark or purchasing cherry bark tinctures or syrups provides the opportunity to take advantage of this wild medicinal herb.\n\n7. Garlic: Garlic is not only a classic culinary ingredient but also a powerful antimicrobial agent and liver protector. Unlike many antimicrobial substances, garlic is gentle on the gut flora while effectively combating invasive microorganisms. Studies have shown that using garlic as a preventive measure can reduce the incidence of colds by 63% and decrease the severity of symptoms, leading to faster recovery times compared to a placebo. Garlic demonstrates anti-viral activity against various viruses, including influenza, cytomegalovirus, rhinovirus, HIV, herpes, viral pneumonia, and rotavirus. Incorporating garlic into your diet can help fortify your immune system during the winter months.\n\n8. Echinacea: Native to North America, echinacea, also known as purple coneflower, is an easily accessible plant commonly found in backyards. Echinacea is known for its immune-stimulating properties. Acrylamide are the primary active compounds in the plant, which provide a characteristic tingling sensation on the tongue and stimulate saliva production. Regular use of echinacea can reduce the risk of developing colds by more than 50% and shorten the duration of cold symptoms by one and a half days. Echinacea has also demonstrated potential efficacy in managing depression and anxiety, making it a suitable addition to combat the challenges of the cold and dark winter months. Echinacea purpura, in particular, is easy to cultivate, and the entire plant, including the leaves, flowers, seeds, and roots, can be utilized. However, it is advisable to wait until the plant is at least two years old before harvesting the roots. Echinacea can be consumed in the form of tinctures, capsules, or dried teas, ensuring the preservation of beneficial acrylamide.\n\nBy incorporating these backyard plants into your daily routine, you can strengthen your immune system and create a natural defense against winter illnesses. Remember, prevention is key, and nurturing your health with the power of plants is a simple yet effective way to enhance your well-being during the colder months. END"}

miranda warning . according to the national constitution center , the \u201cmiranda\u201d in the term comes from ernesto miranda , a man arrested in march of 1963 for rape and kidnapping . while in police custody , miranda confessed to kidnapping and rape charges . however , his lawyers wanted to overturn the conviction . during cross-examination in his trial , miranda\u2019s lawyer wasn\u2019t told he had the right to remain silent and the right to a lawyer . that would later be the framework for miranda v . arizona , a 1966 case that determined the fifth amendment to the constitution ensures people must be read their rights to consult an attorney before and during questioning , and that every defendant had the right against self-incrimination . who was ernesto miranda ? ernesto miranda \u2014 wikipedia commons mitchell caldwell and michael leif at the american heritage magazine say that ernesto arturo miranda was born in mesa , arizona , on march 9 , 1941 , to a mexican immigrant . after his mother died , he didn\u2019t get along well with his father , who remarried . miranda was first convicted of a crime when he was in eighth grade \u2014 he was convicted of burglary and sent to reform school . in that time period , miranda attended the queen of peace grammar school in mesa , arizona . after his release , miranda was arrested for attempted rape and assault . in 1956 , miranda was released from the reform school at the arizona state industrial school for boys ( asisb ) , and he returned there several times after getting in trouble for the law . he eventually moved to los angeles , where he served 45 days in county detention for curfew violations and an armed robbery , and then sent back to arizona . for miranda , his only option at the time was going into the u . s . army . he spent a year and a half in the military and spent a third of his time in service working hard labor for peeping tom acts and going absent without leave permission . he eventually left the military on an honorable discharge and went to texas , where he was sent to federal prison for a year after stealing cars . at that point , miranda seemed to get his life together . he moved in with a woman named twila hoffman in california , who had just separated from her husband but didn\u2019t have money for a divorce . miranda was 21 , and hoffman was 29 , and hoffman had two children . the two had a daughter together , and miranda and hoffman and their children moved back to mesa . miranda worked at a dockworker , while twila hoffman worked at a nursing school . he hadn\u2019t held a single job for more than two weeks up to that point , and he worked so well that his supervisor said he was \u201cone of the best workers [he had] ever had . \u201d the attack in 1963 , an 18-year-old woman named patricia weir ( not her real name ) , who lived in phoenix , worked at a local movie theater . the day was march 2 , 1963 , and one movie caused her to stay late at the theater . the bus didn\u2019t reach her stop until 12 10 a . m . she later went home and walked up the street , but before she got home , a man jumped out of a car , grabbed her , and put a hand over her mouth \u201cdon\u2019t scream , and you won\u2019t get hurt . \u201d she asked the man to \u201clet me go , please let me go , \u201d but he dragged her into the car , tied her hands behind her back , and made her lie down in the back . the man drove the car for 20 minutes , and then untied weir and forced himself upon her , and then made her give him whatever money she had in the backseat . he drove her back to her house and said \u201cwhether you tell your mother what has happened or not is none of my business , but pray for me . \u201d weir pounded on the door , crying as she told her sister what happened . the sister called the police , and weir was taken to the good samaritan hospital to be examined \u2014 two detectives interviewed her . she said the attacker was \u201c[a] mexican male , twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old , five feet eleven inches , 175 pounds , slender build , medium complexion with black , short-cut , curly hair , wearing levi\u2019s , a white t-shirt , and dark-rim glasses . \u201d however , when later asked , she wasn\u2019t sure what the man\u2019s nationality was . she said he might have been italian , and the police didn\u2019t have much to go off of to continue the investigation . however , weir\u2019s brother-in-law , who picked her up at the bus stop after the attack , said he saw a car , a packard , with a license plate of dfl-312 stalking the street and the car . the car , a 1953 packard , belonged to twila hoffman . the confession the maricopa county courthouse \u2014 from marine69\u201371 on wikipedia commons caldwell and leif later say that miranda went to bed one night after a 12-hour-shift at work , and a couple of detectives arrived at his home . according to ron dungan at az central , hoffman answered the door with a baby , and the two children were with her . miranda awoke , and the detectives asked him to come with them to the police station . \u201cwe\u2019d rather not talk to you about this in front of your family , \u201d detective carroll cooley said . they led him to a four-man lineup , where weir identified him . they also led miranda to an interrogation room , where he confessed for two hours to rape and kidnapping . miranda later said the cops coerced him into a confession after being dead tired from the graveyard shift . the detectives later brought weir into the room , and then miranda said \u201cthat\u2019s the girl . \u201d he gave a detailed account that matched weir\u2019s story and then agreed to his confession ' s written statement . at the confession was a disclaimer that a suspect was confessing \u201cwith full knowledge of my legal rights , understanding any statement i make can be used against me . \u201d miranda signed the disclaimer , and then the district attorney filed charged against ernesto miranda for rape and kidnapping . the trial miranda would be represented by an attorney named alvin moore , who represented miranda at the maricopa county courthouse . caldwell and leif describe moore as \u201ca passionless defense attorney\u201d in a very run of the mill case at the courthouse . four witnesses took the stand , and miranda\u2019s confession would be presented as well . weir testified as well , an emotional testimony that had a tremendous effect on the jury . moore , however , at one point , questioned cooley about the interrogation . he asked if cooley read miranda his rights . cooley confirmed that he read the statement . he then questioned cooley about the statement \u2014 it didn\u2019t include anything about the defendant being entitled to the advice of an attorney . knowing this , moore tried to make a formal motion to exclude the confession , but the motion was denied . the jury deliberated after being instructed by the judge . the jury of three women and nine men found him guilty , unanimously . moore later filed an appeal about miranda\u2019s trial , where he asked two pivotal questions that would shape legal history \u201cwas [miranda\u2019s] statement made voluntarily ? \u201d \u201cwas [he] afforded all the safeguards to his rights provided by the constitution of the united states and the law and rules of the courts ? \u201d miranda himself would push the case after the arizona supreme court decided that miranda\u2019s confession was given voluntarily and had been properly admitted since miranda had not sought counsel . miranda then filed a request himself to the supreme court , which caught the attention of robert j . corcoran , an attorney at the aclu . corcoran fought to have miranda\u2019s supreme court case considered , but moore refused to press on with the case . corcoran found assistance in a trial lawyer named john j . flynn , who worked at a firm that took two cases for the aclu a year . flynn solicited the help of an associate named john p . frank , who clerked for hugo l . black , and the two of them would work on the case . frank and flynn would correspond with miranda frequently , and miranda was very thankful for their help , saying \u201cto know that someone has taken an interest in my case , has increased my moral enormously . \u201d miranda v . arizona chief justice earl warren \u2014 public domain preceding miranda v . arizona in the supreme court were cases like gideon v . wainwright , a 1963 case that guaranteed the right to the attorney , and escobedo v . ilinois , a 1964 case that protected the right of criminal suspects to have a right to counsel during police interrogations . both of these cases were protected under the sixth amendment . for the warren court , which fervently protected constitutional rights in desegregating the school system and prohibited prayer in public schools , the miranda case was the convenient successor . escobedo v . ilinois made many clerks , by 1966 , have to mark \u201cescobedo\u201d on cases that had coerced confessions \u2014 and earl warren then chose miranda\u2019s case where he was , in the words of caldwell and leif , \u201cinterrogated for two hours without being informed of either his right to remain silent or his right to counsel . \u201d escobedo\u2019s case , however , was different from miranda . the arizona attorney general\u2019s office made the argument that escobedo\u2019s confession was more coerced . the police made an effort to stop him from seeing a lawyer \u2014 miranda had no such concerted effort . escobedo also had a clean record , and miranda had not , suggesting that miranda knew the interrogation process . frank , on the other hand , gave an argument about constitutional rights . caldwell and leif say \u201cit was the battle of constitutional rights versus the possibility of turning dangerous criminals back into the streets . it was the battle of good versus evil . but what was the ultimate good ? and which was the worst evil ? \u201d on june 13 , 1966 , the warren court decided \u2014 5\u20134 , in favor of miranda . the liberal justices of the court decided in favor , while the conservative justices decided against . the court made sure that the fifth amendment would be the backbone of the miranda protections . earl warren wrote the opinion and said \u201cthis court has recognized that coercion can be mental as well as physical , and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition . \u201d to expand , warren wrote the words that are cited almost verbatim in the miranda warning today , if a person is subject to interrogation \u201c[he] has the right to remain silent \u2026 that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court \u2026 that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation \u2026 [and] that if he is indigent , a lawyer will be appointed to represent him . \u201d warren said that miranda was not told of his right to an attorney and have one present , nor was miranda given his right against self-incrimination . his confession was inadmissible since he had not been given these warnings . legacy caldwell and leif note that opposition to the warren court grew because of the miranda ruling \u2014 the court had , after all , let a confessed rapist go free . miranda warnings are standard in the justice system and the reading of these rights has become universal . ernesto miranda wasn\u2019t actually free after the warren court ruled his confession was inadmissible . he became a celebrity and became \u201cthe most popular inmate at the arizona state prison , \u201d and frequently signed autographs and gave legal advice . however , the maricopa county district attorney\u2019s office retried the case without the confession . before the trial , twila hoffman talked with the prosecutor and said that miranda confessed he\u2019d kidnapped and raped an 18-year-old girl when she visited him in prison , and then asked hoffman to visit weir\u2019s family . he asked hoffman to convey his promise to marry weir if she dropped the charges , and that he would return to hoffman later , but wanted to get out of jail . with twila hoffman and the victim on the stand , hoffman was sentenced to 20 to 30 years by the jury for rape and kidnapping , the same sentence as his original trial . hoffman would later change her name to twila mae spears . flynn once wrote to her in 1973 asking for visitation rights , according to dungan . she wrote in response \u201cthis letter is very close to harassment . any other correspondence as to this matter will result in legal action . \u201d in 1972 , ernesto miranda was paroled . however , he violated his parole , went back to jail , and was freed again in 1975 . he was 34 years old , and in a bar called \u201cthe deuce\u201d in phoenix , he was playing cards with two mexican immigrants . they got into an argument , and the two men stabbed miranda to death . the bartender said the fight ended very quickly . by the time he arrived in the hospital , miranda was pronounced dead . once police arrested fernando rodriguez , one of the men who killed miranda , they read him his miranda rights , in english and spanish .","completion": " The Origin of the Miranda Warning: How Ernesto Miranda's Case Came Before the Supreme Court\n\nThe Miranda warning is now universally recognized within the justice system as a constitutional right to legal counsel and protection against self-incrimination. However, the origin and story behind the Miranda warning are not widely known. According to the National Constitution Center, the term \"Miranda\" refers to Ernesto Miranda, a man arrested in March 1963 for rape and kidnapping.\n\nErnesto Miranda, born on March 9, 1941, in Mesa, Arizona, to a Mexican immigrant, had a troubled background. He was first convicted of a crime in eighth grade for burglary and was sent to reform school. After release, he continued to be involved in criminal activities, eventually leading to his arrest for attempted rape and assault. Miranda's life took a turn when he met Twila Hoffman, and they moved to Mesa together, where they had a daughter and tried to settle down.\n\nHowever, on March 2, 1963, an 18-year-old woman named Patricia Weir was kidnapped and raped. The limited evidence led the police to Twila Hoffman's car, which matched the description given by Weir's brother-in-law. When the police brought Miranda in for questioning, he confessed to the crimes after a two-hour interrogation. However, Miranda's lawyers later argued that he was not informed of his rights to remain silent and consult with a lawyer during the trial.\n\nDuring Miranda's trial, his defense attorney, Alvin Moore, questioned the interrogating detective about whether Miranda was informed of his rights. It was revealed that Miranda was not explicitly told about his right to an attorney. Despite Moore's attempt to exclude the confession, the jury found Miranda guilty. However, Moore filed an appeal, raising questions about Miranda's rights during the interrogation.\n\nThe case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, catching the attention of attorney John J. Flynn and his associate John P. Frank. With their help, the court agreed to consider Miranda's case. On June 13, 1966, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda's favor, stating that individuals must be informed of their rights to remain silent, consult with an attorney, and be protected against self-incrimination. This landmark ruling ensured the protection of these rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nFollowing the Miranda ruling, the use of Miranda warnings became standard practice in the justice system. However, opposition to the ruling grew, leading to criticisms of the Warren Court for allowing a confessed rapist to go free. Miranda, known as the \"most popular inmate\" at the Arizona State Prison, gained celebrity status and even provided legal advice to others. Ultimately, Miranda's confession was deemed inadmissible, but he was retried without it and received the same sentence.\n\nIn 1972, Miranda was paroled but violated his parole and returned to jail. He was released again in 1975, but his life took a tragic turn when he was stabbed to death by two men during an argument in a Phoenix bar. The men who killed Miranda were read their Miranda rights upon arrest.\n\nToday, the Miranda warning is a fundamental aspect of the criminal justice system, ensuring that individuals are informed of their rights to protect themselves during questioning. Despite Ernesto Miranda's troubled life and ultimate tragic end, his case and the resulting Supreme Court ruling have had a lasting impact on the rights of individuals accused of crimes. END"}

Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, with a wide range of industrial applications. These include cancer detection in radiology-based images in the healthcare sector, detection of manufacturing defects and factory floor surveillance in the manufacturing industry, detection of seat belts and parking in restricted areas for public safety, as well as stock level analysis and inventory management in the retail sector.\n\nObject detection falls under one of the four types of visual recognition tasks in computer vision. The first task is image classification, which involves assigning labels to images. For example, labeling cows in a picture of a farm as cows. The second task is object detection, which not only labels the object but also locates it using a bounding box. The third task is semantic segmentation, where the labels are predicted for each pixel of an image without distinguishing between objects with the same label. Lastly, instance segmentation includes both labeling and segmentation of objects.\n\nDeep learning, a subset of machine learning, plays a crucial role in object detection. It can process data from various sources and requires fewer data preprocessing compared to traditional machine learning methods. Deep learning utilizes interconnected layers of software-based calculators known as neurons, which form a neural network. The network processes data by passing them through each layer, with each layer learning increasingly complex features of the data. Once the network has learned how to make determinations from input data accurately, it can apply this knowledge to new data. For instance, a deep neural network trained to recognize cows can quickly detect cows in new images.\n\nTo perform object detection, deep learning models utilize a neural network that processes signals by passing them through a series of nodes, similar to neurons. The network \"learns\" by adjusting the weights that amplify or dampen the signals along each link. Nodes are usually arranged in multiple layers, creating a \"deep\" neural network.\n\nIn recent years, advancements in deep learning models have led to significant improvements in accuracy and performance. These improvements have had a profound impact on medical imaging and surveillance systems. Higher accuracy enables better application of the technology in these fields, while improved performance enables faster inference on modern edge-based computing systems, such as real-time drone-based video analytics.\n\nSpecifically, there have been notable advancements in face detection, where mean average precision has surpassed 90%. Face detection is crucial for applications like face verification, face alignment, and facial recognition. It differs from generic object detection due to the larger range of object scales and prevalence of blurring in face detection. Wider Face is a commonly used benchmark for evaluating face detection algorithms, posing challenges due to the high variance of face scales and the large number of faces per image. In 2019, several models including Pyramid++, VIM-FD, ISBN, Refinance, Announce, and Refinance, reported mean average precision scores above 90% for easy, medium, and hard metrics, representing significant improvements over previous years.\n\nSimilarly, there have been recent trends in pedestrian detection, with the Laypersons dataset considered a challenging benchmark. This dataset is split into subsets based on object height and visibility level, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of detectors. In 2019, the APD model showed a remarkable 30% improvement in object detection performance compared to 2018 [8]. These advancements demonstrate the continuous progress and potential of deep learning in the field of object detection.\n\nOverall, the developments in deep learning for object detection enhance the accuracy and performance of computer vision models, opening up new possibilities in various industries. With continued research and innovation, deep learning will likely play an increasingly vital role in solving complex visual recognition tasks. END"}

It is not too late.\n\nData from Climate Central reveals a clear correlation between significant increases in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and rising temperatures. Carbon dioxide accounts for 75% of greenhouse gases, largely stemming from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These greenhouse gases act as a barrier, trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere that would normally dissipate into space during nighttime temperature drops. Essentially, these gases function like the glass panels in a greenhouse, allowing sunlight to enter but preventing heat from escaping, resulting in a global temperature increase.\n\nNational Geographic warns that the continued rise in global temperature could have catastrophic consequences for wildlife, sea levels, and the melting of ice caps and glaciers. Additionally, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events will be affected. We have already witnessed heatwaves, extreme storms, and shifting seasonal patterns, all of which serve as indicators of climate change and global warming.\n\nIn a recent article, The Guardian highlighted scientist Brad Lister's return to a Puerto Rican rainforest after 35 years, only to discover that 98% of ground insects had disappeared, most likely due to global warming. This decline in insect population jeopardizes the foundation of the rainforest food chain, risking an \"ecological Armageddon.\" The consequences further propagate to other creatures dependent on these insects for food, such as the Puerto Rican today, whose numbers have declined by 90%. Lister describes this as a \"bottom-up trophic cascade\" because the entire food web suffers and degrades when invertebrates decline. Jonathan Watts also noted in The Guardian that 45% of all potential environmental collapses are interconnected and capable of amplifying one another. Action must be taken before these issues escalate into a wider and more devastating problem.\n\nWhile businesses and governments must take a stronger stance on climate policy, individuals can also make small changes to reduce their carbon footprint and positively impact the environment. This can involve simple domestic alterations, such as unplugging devices, utilizing low-carbon or public transportation instead of fuel-based vehicles, adopting renewable energy sources, and insulating homes.\n\nEnergitoken is introducing incentives to encourage individuals to embrace these changes. By rewarding energy-saving behavior with Energitokens (ETC), a tangible cryptocurrency, customers who engage in purchasing low-carbon transport, solar panels, or energy-efficient appliances from their partners can receive Tokens. These Tokens can then be spent within the Energitoken ecosystem with approved partners. On5, one of Energitoken's partners, supports domestic and commercial energy consumption changes through workshops and their recently launched Energy100 program, which educates individuals on how to be more efficient in their homes and workplaces. People may be surprised by how even small changes in behavior can significantly impact the environment. If everyone makes a small adjustment to their consumer habits, the collective impact will be substantial.\n\nWorking alongside several energy-efficient and environmentally conscious partners, Energitoken aims to lead decarbonization efforts and reduce energy consumption, thereby mitigating the damaging human impact on the environment. By incentivizing behavioral change through ETC, more people will be motivated to make eco-friendly choices until it becomes instinctive, resulting in a sustained and growing impact on the environment.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that small changes can yield significant consequences. As Juan Rocha from the Stockholm Resilience Center aptly states, \"every action counts.\" Visit www.energitoken.com today to learn more about how you can reduce consumption and be rewarded for your efforts.

or , to put it another way , don\u2019t we have the responsibility to use battle-tested patterns to save time and ensure the best possible final product ? this is how design patterns reel you in . a brief history of design patterns the idea of patterns \u2014 conceptual models that you can define and reuse \u2014 has deep roots , stretching back to real architecture ( of buildings ) and the work of christopher alexander . but design patterns as most programmers know them sprang into existence in 1994 , when four coding geniuses wrote a book called design patterns elements of reusable object-oriented software . the book that launched a thousand design reviews design patterns set out 23 foundational patterns grouped into three categories creational , structural , and behavioral . you can review all of them here . amazingly enough , when people talk about design patterns today \u2014 some 25 years later \u2014 they\u2019re usually referring to one of the ancient patterns first codified in this book . this sort of success is no accident . and there\u2019s no denying that the original design patterns were written by sharper programmers than you or me . but design patterns aren\u2019t a neutral part of software design , and using them has a price that\u2019s often overlooked . the cost of complexity design patterns are often sold to programmers with architectural analogies . imagine you were building a new home . would you want the tradespeople doing the work to reinvent domestic plumbing systems ? would you want the electrician to cook up his own approach to wiring fuses ? a couple of design patterns short of perfection / [pixabay] but building software systems is very different than building houses . for one thing , design patterns aren\u2019t ingredients you can drop straight into your code , like a handy function from a class library . instead , each pattern is a model that needs to be implemented . most design patterns define an interaction that spans different objects , which means you need to make changes to several classes . the sheer weight of this extra code complicates your design . they\u2019re especially dangerous for new developers , who never see a coding side-trip they don\u2019t want to take . even when design patterns are at their best , they force you to trade simplicity for something else . often , that \u201csomething else\u201d is just a vague promise of good encapsulation and a warm fuzzy feeling . the general problem / xkcd design patterns are opinionated . they embed themselves in your code , and they pull your classes in specific directions . even the simplest patterns have a cost and introduce complexity . consider the humble singleton pattern\u2014a class that only allows one instance . despite its conceptual simplicity , there\u2019s roughly a dozen different techniques for implementing the singleton pattern , depending on whether you need thread safety , lazy loading , serializability , support for inheritance , or you just love enums . it\u2019s not that singleton design is an advanced concept . it\u2019s just impossible to design any single code ingredient to be perfectly generalized and perfectly suitable to every use case . and to this day , architects still debate if the singleton is a virtuous gold-plated pattern or an anti-pattern\u2014 something you should strive to avoid , because someday it will betray you . ambiguous extensibility design patterns are all about increasing abstraction in your code . patterns like proxy , bridge , adapter , and facade add layers in between objects . at first , this seems like programming paradise . what virtuous programmer doesn\u2019t want less dependency between objects ? we all know the rule all problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection . but there\u2019s a side effect , too . every extra layer of indirection adds a new place where you can put a solution . in other words , the more you abstract your design with patterns , the more places you open up for someone else to change the code . future programmers are going to have trouble figuring out what part of the system to modify , and how they can extend the code without having their work collide with someone else\u2019s changes . the worst offender is the mediator pattern , which aims to let two objects interact without knowing anything about each other . the result is either the a holy nirvana of abstraction , or a way to seriously confuse responsibilities in your class model . there are two ways to wreck a car 1 ) tear it apart . 2 ) call it a generalized road-limited transport container and start adding to it . mismatching and bad fits it\u2019s easy to rush into implementing patterns without understanding the context\u2014in other words , how do these patterns fit into your chosen language , framework , and type of application ? the answer can be murky . modern language features like generics change the way patterns are used . dynamic languages from lisp to python make many patterns obsolete , according to no less a programmer than peter norvig . and functional programming languages exist in a parallel universe with completely different patterns . these inconsistencies aren\u2019t limited to language features . other patterns don\u2019t play nicely with certain types of infrastructure . for example , you don\u2019t want chatty objects if you\u2019re dealing with network protocols , and multithreaded code can break the standard implementations of most of the original 23 design patterns . patterns are at their best in the hands of framework designers , who can integrate them directly into a framework . for example , events are modern examples of the observer pattern . the prototype pattern is fused into javascript ( and the source of all its object-oriented features ) . server-side web frameworks like asp . net implement the legendary model view controller pattern . and so on . the antidote be simple if design patterns are dangerous , what\u2019s the solution ? the answer is to take a simple , solemn pledge . it\u2019s a sort of hippocratic oath of the programming world first , be simple . if you\u2019re deep in a thorny problem , in a fog of semicolons and class relationships , trying to untangle responsibilities and keep everything manageable , pause . don\u2019t let design patterns short-circuit your critical thinking . after all , having a pattern does not protect you from a bad design . there\u2019s no guarantee that the problem you think you\u2019re solving with a pattern is the problem you need to solve . and adding patterns that don\u2019t address the right problems \u2014 or any problem at all \u2014 is a certain path to software maintenance hell . if you can guarantee nothing else about your program , promise to keep it simple . standards / xkcd patterns are a design language the real value of design patterns is not prescriptive ( telling you what to do ) . it\u2019s descriptive ( telling others what you\u2019ve done ) . design patterns aren\u2019t recipes . they\u2019re a language . good things happen when you think of design patterns as a language that can help you talk about application design . you don\u2019t need to start out trying to use patterns . instead \u2014 with experience \u2014 you\u2019ll begin to recognize the outlines of patterns crystallizing in your code . for example , if you code web services , you\u2019re almost certainly using the facade pattern , whether you recognize it or not . once you recognize the emerging structure of your code , you can use the language of design patterns \u2014 concepts like factory , decorator , and facade \u2014 to formalize what you\u2019ve done . design patterns can\u2019t teach you software architecture . they aren\u2019t meant as an excuse to write a lot of code or a way to avoid thinking deeply about design . but they can help you think about your designs at a higher level of abstraction . and that\u2019s probably what the gang of four were hoping all along .","completion": " One of the fundamental principles of good programming is to avoid solving the same problem repeatedly. If a solution already exists, such as the perfect bubble sort or a reliable regular expression to validate email addresses, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. This logic is straightforward to understand. Reinventing functionality can introduce new bugs and unforeseen shortcomings, leading to additional testing time and potential hidden problems within the application.\n\nDesign patterns offer a tempting solution to this problem. By using battle-tested patterns created by experienced programmers, we can save time and ensure the best possible final product. The concept of patterns, defined and reusable conceptual models, dates back to real architecture, but it became well-known in the programming world with the release of the book \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\" in 1994. This book introduced 23 foundational patterns, categorized into creation, structural, and behavioral patterns, which are still referenced today.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that design patterns are not a neutral aspect of software design, and using them comes with a cost that is often overlooked. Design patterns are often sold to programmers using architectural analogies. While it makes sense for tradespeople to reuse established plumbing systems or electricians to follow established wiring methods in building a home, the implementation of design patterns in software is different. Each pattern is a model that needs to be implemented, requiring changes to multiple classes and adding complexity to the design. This complexity is particularly challenging for new developers.\n\nFurthermore, design patterns introduce opinionated decisions into the code, pulling classes in specific directions. Even simple patterns like the singleton pattern, which allows only one instance of a class, can have multiple implementation techniques depending on specific requirements. It's impossible to design a code ingredient that perfectly fits every use case. Some patterns may be seen as virtuous gold-plated solutions, while others may be regarded as potential pitfalls to avoid.\n\nDesign patterns also increase the abstraction in code, introducing additional layers between objects. While this seems beneficial initially, it creates more places for developers to add solutions, leading to potential confusion for future programmers trying to modify or extend the code. The mediator pattern, for example, aims to enable object interaction without knowledge of each other, but it can either result in abstraction nirvana or confusion in the responsibilities within the class model.\n\nThere's also the challenge of patterns not always fitting well into specific programming languages, frameworks, or types of applications. Modern language features, dynamic languages, and functional programming languages may render some patterns obsolete or incompatible. It's crucial to understand the context in which patterns are being used to avoid mismatching and bad fits. Not all patterns play nicely with certain types of infrastructure or language features.\n\nDesign patterns are most effective in the hands of framework designers who can integrate them seamlessly into a framework. Events in modern programming languages are an example of the observer pattern, and web frameworks like ASP.NET incorporate the model-view-controller pattern. Utilizing patterns as part of a framework ensures their optimal usage.\n\nIn light of the potential dangers and challenges posed by design patterns, it is important to follow a simple approach to software development. Rather than relying solely on patterns, critical thinking and simplicity should be at the forefront. It's crucial not to let design patterns hinder critical thinking or lead to the adoption of patterns that don't solve the right problems. Keeping code simple should be a priority, as simplicity is key to effective software development.\n\nThe true value of design patterns lies in using them as a language to describe and communicate application design. Viewing design patterns as a language helps formalize and communicate the structure and concepts present in the code. With experience, programmers start recognizing patterns in their code, even if they didn't consciously implement them. This recognition allows for a higher level of abstraction in design and facilitates communication about design decisions.\n\nDesign patterns are not meant to teach software architecture or serve as an excuse for excessive code. Instead, they offer a way to think about designs at a higher level of abstraction. The intention of the authors of the book \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\" was likely to encourage deeper thinking about design by providing a language to describe and communicate design decisions.

It is important to recognize that you possess significant intelligence and capability. Utilize these qualities to your advantage. \n\nIdentifying the one thing that you are genuinely passionate about may seem like a daunting task, but it is not an insurmountable challenge. By this point in your life, you likely have a sense of your likes and dislikes. Take the time to reflect on what truly ignites your passion and consider what changes you would like to see in your own life or in the lives of others. It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel; rather, focus on discovering what sets your heart on fire and how you can contribute to improving existing issues or processes. Although inspiration is important, spending endless days aimlessly browsing distracting websites will not lead you to your life-defining idea. \n\nTo ensure that you have found your true passion, take a page from Mark Cuban's book and consider his 12 rules for startups. Avoid starting a venture unless it becomes an obsession and something you genuinely adore. If you have an exit strategy in mind, it does not constitute an obsession. \n\nOnce you have identified your life's passion, it is crucial to take immediate action. Break the cycle of indecision and simply begin. You will be pleasantly surprised at the number of people who will reach out to you and express interest in collaborating once you embark on your journey. Jot down your idea on a piece of paper (yes, a simple piece of paper will suffice) and venture out into the world. Engage with people. It is important to dispel any notions of fearing idea theft; rather, engage with as many individuals as possible.

This can include services such as Google Maps and other APIs that are essential for app functionality. However, configuring these services correctly can sometimes be confusing. In this article, we will discuss how to enable multiple apps to access the same Google Cloud Services, specifically focusing on the Google Maps API.\n\nFirstly, it is important to ensure that you have set up billing for your project. You can have more than one billing account if needed. Once billing is set up, you can proceed to create a new project and associate it with the desired billing account.\n\nWithin your project, you will need to enable the specific API services that you require, such as the Google Maps API or the Places API. This can be done through the Google Cloud Console. By enabling these services, you are granting your apps access to the functionality provided by these APIs.\n\nLastly, you will need to create API keys for your apps. These keys will allow your apps to authenticate with the enabled APIs and access their respective services. When creating API keys, you have the option to allow them to access all APIs or restrict their access to specific ones, depending on your app's requirements.\n\nNow, let's address the issue of using different keys or certificates for apps signed differently, such as when using app bundles. Option 1 is to create a separate API key for the internal testing app. This would require modifying your build.Gradle file to specify different key access for the internal testing app compared to the production version. All the API key restrictions that the original key had will need to be set accordingly. It is important to note that any future changes to the API keys should be taken into consideration as well.\n\nOption 2 is to sign the APK with the same original keystone, essentially reverting to the initial setup where the internal app's keystone signature matches that of the production app. This means no changes to the build.Gradle file or the need for a new API key. However, it does discard the benefits of using app bundles, which eliminate the requirement for the original keystone.\n\nOption 3 offers a workaround solution by using the same API key but supporting different keystone signatures. This can be achieved by navigating to the \"Credentials\" section in the Google Cloud Console. From there, you can find a list of API keys and select the one that you are currently using. By following this approach, you can configure your apps with different keystone signatures while still utilizing the same API key.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding how to enable multiple apps to access the same Google Cloud Services is crucial for ensuring seamless functionality across all your mobile applications. By following the guidelines provided by Google and making informed decisions regarding API keys and app signing, you can optimize the integration of Google Cloud Services into your apps. END"}

As a result, each audio app is striving for greater ambition and aiming to capture more \"ear-time,\" much like how Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime compete for screen time.\n\n3) Informative to Engaging\n\nOne possible reason why some book/e-book readers have not yet transitioned to audiobook listeners is the fear of zoning out while listening. To convert these readers into listeners, we may see the introduction of more customization options for AI-generated narration. These options could range from \"monotonous\" to \"dramatic\" and even include genres like \"rap music.\" Voice emulation has incredible power, and while there are concerns about deep fakes and misuse of such technology, it is essential to focus on the positive possibilities it opens up for humanity.\n\n4) Convergence of Media\n\nWhile there are avid readers who prefer traditional books and dedicated audiobook fans who are glued to their AirPods, there is a middle ground where some people enjoy both reading and listening simultaneously. Currently, book, e-book, and audiobook purchases for the same title are considered separate entities. This could be due to poor integration between formats, a focus on optimizing individual revenues, or an assumption that people choose one experience exclusively over the other. In the future, we can expect audiobooks to be bundled for free or at a nominal price with book and e-book purchases. Captions on audiobooks could become the new e-book, creating a more integrated reading experience.\n\n5) Auto-Translation\n\nThe market expansion of audiobooks goes beyond converting readers into listeners. There is a massive untapped market of people worldwide who either do not prefer to read in English or cannot read English at all. Making stories available for listening in local or regional languages and accents can open up significant market opportunities, especially in the self-help category. Technology is the key to scaling the translation of millions of books into thousands of languages with various accents and voices. Google's language translation capabilities already showcase the potential, as demonstrated by real-time translation with the upcoming Google Pixel Buds. While the technology is not perfect, the possibilities are promising, especially when translation is not required in real-time.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of audiobooks is exciting and full of potential. As technology continues to advance, we can anticipate a shift towards narrator-less audiobooks, increased competition from various audio platforms, more engaging narration options, convergence of different media formats, and expanded reach through auto-translation. The possibilities that lie ahead are vast, and the impact on the reading experience and global accessibility to stories and knowledge is immense.

However, to achieve this, a data and business intelligence (BI) function is essential to power analytics and inform decisions. Using spreadsheets to provide holistic insights when data is spread across multiple systems is both difficult and not scalable. Therefore, setting up an analytics function becomes necessary as it forms the foundation of your business and future growth.\n\nTo shed some light on this process, we would like to share the story of how we created our BI/analytics function within a six-week timeframe. This technical story outlines the steps we took and the lessons we learned, which we hope will be valuable for other startups looking to establish their own BI/analytics function.\n\nThe Four Basic Components of Your BI/Data Infrastructure\n\nTo begin, there are four fundamental components required to build most BI/data warehouse systems:\n\n1. Ingestion and compute layer: This layer is responsible for ingesting and transforming data through ETL/ELT processes.\n\n2. Persistent data layer: This layer stores the raw and modeled data, either in a data lake or data warehouse.\n\n3. Visualization layer: This layer provides insights through various BI tools.\n\n4. Additional components: These may include workflow automation, data quality, CI/CD, etc.\n\nEvaluating Infrastructure Vendors\n\nThe first challenge in setting up a BI/analytics function is to identify the appropriate technology/vendor for each component. With numerous options available in today's BI/data space, each with its own pros and cons, selecting scalable components that can support the company's growth from early-stage to growth-stage is crucial. Here are some key considerations:\n\nStep 1: Define what fits the company's needs\n- Is the company's infrastructure hosted on the cloud or on-premise?\n- What are the organization's plans for migration in the next one to two years?\n- What cloud vendor is being used?\n- Are there any specific data security requirements or compliance regulations to consider?\n- What is the budget allocated for BI in terms of both people and technology?\n- How does the budget scale with company growth?\n- What are the pressing and critical needs of each department that can help drive the company forward?\n\nStep 2: Understand the Business Use Cases and the 3 V's (Volumes, Variety, Velocity)\n- Create an inventory of data-producing systems and estimate the volume of data they generate.\n- Consider future use-cases and multiply the estimated volume by a factor of 10 to account for growth.\n- Identify the types of data produced by different departments and whether it is structured or semi-structured.\n- Determine how frequently decisions need to be made at various levels and functions within the organization.\n\nMaking the Vendor Selection\n\nArmed with the above information, you can now identify the requirements for your vendors. Some example requirements include:\n\n- Cloud-based solutions that can scale both vertically and horizontally.\n- Minimal resource contention between concurrent ETL writes and dashboard reads.\n- Low maintenance costs.\n- Compliance with data security standards.\n- Support for various file and data formats.\n- Budget considerations.\n- Less vendor risk and components that are easily portable.\n\nSelecting the Data Store\n\nConsider solutions like AWS Redshift, AWS RDS, AWS S3 with Hive/Presto layer, Snowflake, etc., based on the requirements identified.\n\nSelecting the ETL/ELT layer\n\nEvaluate different options, considering time constraints, resource availability, and the need for minimal maintenance. Cloud-based managed data pipeline platforms with pre-built connectors can streamline the integration process.\n\nBI Tools\n\nLook for cloud solutions that offer maturity, a variety of visualization options, a user-friendly interface, cost-effectiveness, and proven experiences.\n\nSetting It Up\n\nOnce you have identified the solution that best suits your BI/data infrastructure needs, proceed with vendor evaluations, proof of concepts (POCs), and contracts. This entire process typically takes around three weeks, after which you can set up your complete BI infrastructure in less than six weeks. By week four, you can begin delivering dashboards and surfacing rich analytics.\n\nRemember, as your company grows, the complexity of your analytics function will increase, and there will always be a need to adapt and evolve your infrastructure to meet the growing demands of the business. Change is constant, and staying nimble is key to success.\n\nWe hope sharing our story provides you with a starting point and a framework for quickly establishing your own BI/analytics function.\n\nAbout People.ai\n\nPeople.ai accelerates enterprise growth through the power of AI. Our revenue intelligence system frees all customer-facing teams, including sales, marketing, and customer success, from manual data entry by automatically capturing contact and customer activity data. It dynamically updates CRM and other systems of record and provides actionable intelligence across management tools, enabling enterprises to fully embrace their selling potential. END"}
{"prompt": "if you are running kubernetes ( k8s ) clusters in production and security is of utmost importance to you , you would have been at crossroads to choose between a private or a public cluster . most of the major cloud providers give these options via their managed kubernetes service solutions and all you need to do is choose one . and once you choose a private cluster , one of the immediate problems to tackle will be handling egress traffic ( to the outside world ) . with a private cluster , all the nodes will only have a private ip and all egress traffic will need to be routed through some kind of a gateway that can talk to the internet . we were also at this crossroads and made the decision to use a gke private cluster and allow internet access via a cloud nat . while this worked very well for us from a security perspective , it caused us some problems when it came to handling outbound traffic bursts and we had to think about alternate solutions for handling this more efficiently . since we were already using a service mesh within our k8s clusters , we started thinking about if we could leverage it in some way to have a better solution for our problem . the final design we came up with was to use the service mesh for routing traffic to a set of proxies with ssl pass-through , running on nodes outside the k8s cluster with external ip addresses , thereby bypassing cloud nat . we also had to ensure that nothing changed from an application perspective , like the urls being configured , and the proxies have fail overs . the setup when we started off was very simple and is shown below . egress via nat there is a private k8s cluster and a cloud nat , which was setup to perform nat on the primary address range of the subnet . this would work well when the rps is not that high ( how high will have to be derived from the math stated below ) . once you have the high rps workloads in the cluster , the problem will slowly start to show up . we started seeing errors in application logs saying connection was refused and debugging further led us to cloud nat logs where we saw connection dropped errors being logged . an example of the nat log entry is shown below . this prompted us to go back to cloud nat specifications and look for the section where they had mentioned how the ports are calculated based on the external ip addresses ( at a high level , this is what it says the number of ports allocated per node restricts the total number of simultaneous connections that can be established to one unique destination from that node . the destination is derived from ip address , port and protocol . the math we overlooked ports_per_vm = 64 total_nat_ip_address = 3 ports_per_nat_ip = 64512 total_vms = 100 doesn\u2019t look bad , right ? we need a total of 64 * 100 = 6400 ports and we have much more than that here , 3 * 64512 = 193536 . the issue was not the availability of the total allocatable ports by cloud nat , rather it was the number of ports allocated per node . in this case , it\u2019s 64 . this means , we can only have 64 simultaneous connections to , let\u2019s say ( assuming it resolves to one public ip ) from that node . now imagine a case where two pods are running on the same node and each has an rps of 100 and needs to make an external call per request . this can lead to port exhaustion in that node and errors in the application . this is exactly what cloud nat logs were telling us by saying connections were dropped . gcp also mentions that they induce a 2-minute delay before the gateway can reuse the same source address and port for establishing a new connection . this only makes things worse . check out the link for more details . so then , we decided to ensure there are enough ports allocated per node for handling the traffic bursts . the new math ports_per_vm = 8192 ports_per_nat_ip = 64512 total_vms = 100 total_nat_ip_address = ( ports_per_vm * total_vms ) / ports_per_nat_ip = 8192 * 100 / 64512 = ~13 do you need so many ports per node is a question you will need to answer based on the traffic patterns you have . we did try with lower numbers and kept on increasing in steps till we reached this value and stopped seeing the connection dropped errors . ( this could have been due to the fact that we have our infrastructure spread across multiple networks and there are certain connections that have to be made through public ips ) . yes , 13 addresses are not that bad . but we had two issues with this it became a bit cumbersome to get all these ips whitelisted at the third party network we had to connect to . and to satisfy the use case for a subset of the workloads , we were ensuring all nodes have the minimum required number of ports allocated . this means most of these ports were sitting idle and is not an efficient way of utilizing resources . to address these problems , we started thinking about a solution which will allow us to route our high rps external calls through a cluster of egress proxies , which will all have a public ip assigned to them and thus will allow us to bypass the nat and we didn\u2019t have to worry about deciphering the right value for the ports_per_vm variable . this means we can keep the nat ips to a minimum and expand the egress cluster as and when needed . we could use nginx as the egress proxy with ssl pass-through using the stream module and don\u2019t have to worry about the limit on simultaneous outbound connections any more . proposed solution proposed solution ( with istio ) since all the calls are from within the k8s cluster equipped with istio , we could use service entry , workload entry , destination rule , and virtualservice to configure istio , and in turn envoy , to perform the routing through the egress proxies in a reliable way . let ' s understand briefly what all these components of an istio service mesh are responsible for a serviceentry allows you to add services outside the mesh into the service registry of istio thereby enabling traffic management to these services . we will create service entries for the hosts we are connecting to and the egress proxies , as both are residing outside the mesh . a workloadentry along with a serviceentry allows you to configure clusters in envoy . a cluster is nothing but a group of upstream targets where the traffic has to be routed based on certain match conditions . we will use workload entries to create a cluster for the egress proxy having multiple endpoints . a destinationrule allows you to configure what happens to the traffic for a given cluster . we will use destination rules to configure health checks and ejection for the egress proxy endpoints . a virtualservice allows you to configure routes in envoy . routes allow us to mention the upstream cluster to which traffic has to be routed based on a set of conditions . we will use virtual service to route the traffic to external hosts via the egress proxies . in our case , let\u2019s say the external api we are calling is and the egress proxies are egress-1 . mydomain . internal & egress-2 . mydomain . internal , what we need to tell envoy is that if you see an sni named example . com in the request , please forward it to one of the healthy instances among egress-1 . mydomain . internal or egress-2 . mydomain . internal . the details of the service entries , workload entries , destination rules and virtual services for achieving the above result is shown below workload entries per egress proxy and tagged with a label ( app egress-proxies ) service entry with a workload selector targeting the two workload entries created in the above step . destination rule instructing envoy to eject endpoints that have crossed the threshold of failures within a given period of time . you can play around with the outlier detection configuration to match your needs . virtual service instructing envoy to route the traffic to example . com via the egress proxy . once the above setup is done you should have the traffic to example . com routed via the egress proxies . to verify all is good , you could run the sleep deployment in istio docs and do a curl request and check the istio proxy logs as mentioned there . you should see the routing being done to the clusters we created and not to the passthroughcluster ( a virtual cluster to which all traffic which istio doesn\u2019t care about is routed ) . you could verify the istio configuration using these commands ##

Most major cloud providers offer these options through their managed Kubernetes service solutions, making it easy for you to make a choice. When selecting a private cluster, you will need to address the issue of handling egress traffic to the outside world.\n\nIn a private cluster, all nodes only have private IP addresses, which means that any outbound traffic needs to be routed through a gateway that can connect to the internet. While using a private cluster provides enhanced security, it can lead to challenges when dealing with outbound traffic bursts. To address this issue, you can leverage a service mesh within your Kubernetes clusters to develop a more efficient solution.\n\nIn our case, we were using a GKE private cluster and allowed internet access through a Cloud NAT. Although this setup worked well for security purposes, it posed problems when faced with high volumes of outbound traffic. To overcome this, we designed a solution that involved routing traffic through a set of proxies with SSL pass-through, located outside the Kubernetes cluster and equipped with external IP addresses. This allowed us to bypass the Cloud NAT. Additionally, we ensured that this solution did not require any changes from an application perspective, such as configuring URLs, and that the proxies had failovers in place.\n\nInitially, our setup was straightforward, with egress traffic flowing through the NAT. However, as the Request Per Second (RPS) increased, we encountered errors in our application logs indicating connection refusals. Further investigation led us to Cloud NAT logs that logged connection dropped errors. By reviewing the Cloud NAT specifications, we discovered that the issue was not due to the availability of allocated ports, but the number of ports allocated per node. In our case, the limit was set to 64, meaning that only 64 simultaneous connections could be established from a single node.\n\nTo address this limitation, we increased the number of ports allocated per node to handle traffic bursts more effectively. By recalculating the port allocation requirement using a formula, we determined that we needed approximately 13 ports per node to avoid connection dropped errors. It is important to consider your unique traffic patterns when determining the necessary number of ports per node.\n\nHowever, this solution introduced challenges related to whitelisting the numerous IP addresses associated with the proxies. Moreover, allocating the minimum required number of ports to all nodes resulted in inefficient utilization of resources. To overcome these problems, we considered a solution that would route high RPS external calls through a cluster of egress proxies, each equipped with a public IP address. This would allow us to bypass the NAT and eliminate the need to calculate the correct value for the ports_per_vm variable. By keeping the NAT IPs to a minimum and expanding the egress cluster as needed, we could use NGINX as the egress proxy with SSL pass-through, utilizing the stream module to avoid concerns regarding the limit on simultaneous outbound connections.\n\nTo implement this solution effectively, we leveraged Into, a service mesh, within our Kubernetes cluster. Using components such as service entry, workload entry, destination rule, and virtual service, we configured Into and, subsequently, the Envoy proxy to reliably route traffic through the egress proxies. Service entry allowed us to add services outside the mesh into Into's service registry for traffic management. Workload entry, in conjunction with service entry, enabled us to configure clusters in Envoy. Destination rules were used to determine how traffic for a given cluster is handled, including health checks and ejection of endpoints. Virtual services were configured to establish routes in Envoy, specifying the upstream cluster to which traffic should be directed based on certain conditions.\n\nFor our specific use case, we created service entries for the external hosts we needed to connect to and for the egress proxies located outside the mesh. We also employed workload entries to create a cluster for the egress proxy with multiple endpoints. Destination rules were utilized to configure health checks and ejection parameters for the egress proxy endpoints. Lastly, virtual services were deployed to route traffic to the desired external hosts through the egress proxies. For instance, if we wanted to route traffic to example.com, we instructed Envoy to forward requests to one of the healthy instances among the egress proxies (egress-1.my domain.internal or egress-2.my domain.internal).\n\nAfter completing the setup, all traffic destined for the specified external hosts should be routed via the egress proxies. To verify the configuration, you can use Into commands to check listeners, filter chains, routing rules, clusters, and their endpoints. This will ensure that traffic is being routed correctly.\n\nIt's important to note that the egress proxies running on nodes outside the Kubernetes cluster do not currently have an auto-scaling solution in place. This limitation can be addressed by using autoscaling groups or running a small public Kubernetes cluster exclusively for hosting egress proxies. However, additional considerations regarding dynamic external IP address management may be required to prevent issues related to whitelisting.\n\nIn summary, by leveraging service mesh technology like Into, we were able to address the challenges of handling egress traffic in a private Kubernetes cluster. Service entries, workload entries, destination rules, and virtual services provided us with the necessary tools to add external services and egress proxies to the mesh and configure traffic routing efficiently. This allowed us to bypass issues associated with NAT and optimize resource utilization.\n\nIf you are interested in joining our engineering team in Bangalore, we encourage you to check out our open roles.

as a platform/company learns more and more about you , can it provide better or more curated , premium services ? inspirations","completion": " I am currently interested in exploring the field of algorithm models to make them more transparent and fair. This includes various contexts such as e-commerce, job searches, and social media platforms. \n\nIn the context of e-commerce, I am intrigued by the price fluctuations based on users' geolocation, neighborhood, and personal data. It would be interesting to examine variables such as socioeconomic status and gender within this context. Similarly, in the realm of job searches conducted online, I am keen to explore the impact of personal data stored by platforms like Google on search results. Do job searches yield different results for men and women? \n\nWithin social media platforms, I am curious about the extent to which users' newsfeeds differ based on their interactions. How much do these feeds vary? Points of interest that I would like to address include transparency in algorithm models, agency and control for users, fairness, and rebuilding trust between users and companies. \n\nOne possible method to enhance transparency and control is by categorizing users' individual data into \"re-usable\" and \"not re-usable\" by third parties. By aggregating the data and categorizing them, we could develop a system that informs users of the possible consequences, likelihood of occurrence, and the benefits they may gain. This would allow users to have control over what data they reveal and withdraw, as well as set limitations on how long the data can be used if shared. Providing users with transparency and agency over their data would help build trust between users and companies. Although this approach may not have immediate commercial applicability, companies should be open to audits on moral grounds considering the amount of power they hold. \n\nAnother idea I find interesting is the concept of a personal digital entity owned solely by the user, which can be accessed by others only on their terms. This \"digital me\" would allow users to curate different models of themselves depending on various situations. For instance, Pedro Domingo's discusses a personal digital bank that stores personal data, anonymizes it, and gives users control over how and when to use aspects of the data when interacting with third-party sites. \n\nPotential contexts for implementing these ideas include product searches on websites like Staples.com with fluctuating prices, flight searches based on origin and country, and job searches displaying different results based on gender, age, or socioeconomic status. We should address both the issue of biased search results and users' lack of control over data usage. However, given the complexity and technical skills required for addressing bias, I will primarily focus on achieving transparency and agency for users. Enabling users to see what is happening and giving them a say in the data they store in search engine databases will allow them to consciously create their own models and have at least some control in personalized search results. This would foster agency, fairness, and trust between the user and the company. \n\nIn terms of the design process, I need to further explore what this system could do for the users and the companies. Additionally, various aspects of this system need to be researched, especially regarding its implementation on social media platforms. For example, while setting the reusability status for another company like Google search might be plausible, determining how information inputted during registration on platforms like Facebook gets displayed for the company and friends requires further investigation. Furthermore, as platforms gather more information about users, they could potentially provide better, more curated, premium services. \n\nThese ideas are inspired by the need for greater transparency, fairness, and control in algorithm models, along with the increasing importance of user trust and agency. By addressing these concerns, we can strive for a more ethical and user-centric approach in the field of algorithm models. END"}

jingles , loyalty rewards , ads , commercials , lies , repetition . i digress . as the plant-based diet becomes noticeably more popular , as a vegan , i have observed many companies switching their strategies . they are beginning to change the way they market their products to us by using little plant-based logos at the top of their packages or are actually printing on the package that it is plant-based . this is done even when their product is not completely plant-based . i hate to say this , i really do , but they have every right to do so . there are no great laws governing our food that say they cannot . the system was built to fool and confuse us . trickery in advertising and labels is not frowned upon for some reason . so , as long as there is some form of plant in the food it can be called plant-based . just like sunny d isn\u2019t really orange juice , it only has 2% concentrated oj in it . it\u2019s just sugar water . actually , high fructose corn syrup water . they just put a big picture of a cut orange on the label to lure us in . it works too . please don\u2019t drink that . now that i think about it , sunny d is now labeled as a fruit drink and not a juice , but i do remember a time as a kid of the eighties when it was not the case . it does seem like the powers that be have made this juice/drink thing right . progress can be slow . getting back to the topic , all of these illusions can be tricky for people who are actually vegan or only eat plant-based foods . many of these products that have a plant-based logo on the front have ingredients like eggs and milk in them . again , technically these products are still plant-based in advertising speak . you have to remember to always check the ingredients . i wish there was an easier way to get this information , or that we could just trust what a company says , but no , almost always no . when i come across a new product i am interested in , i always ask it \u201cwhat are you trying to hide from me\u201d ? so get out your phone , set it to your favorite camera app and use it as a magnifying glass to read those tiny little ingredient labels . i personally find no shame in this and hope you will not either . when i finally do zoom in to that ingredient list , i find that milk powder is one that i run into most often . this usually happens in cereals and in the snacks that have some sort of seasoning . in fact , if you plan on buying any kind of flavored chips or snacks , there is really only one thing to do . that is right , check the label before buying . doritos , for instance , have cheese , milk , buttermilk , whey , and other milk-based ingredients in it . what ! that is a no go for me . i\u2019ve been dorito free for three years now and could care less . now , when i buy chips , they are baked and have simple seasonings or just plain . i know i can make something at home that will make these chips taste amazing . many loaves of bread are out to fool you as well . they can contain milk , butter , eggs , or lard . noodles and pasta have the habit of adding eggs to the recipe . orange juice that is enriched with omega-3 is another one . the omega-3 usually comes from fish oil . oj and fish oil doesn\u2019t seem like a particularly amazing combination yet it does exist . actually , anything enriched with omega-3 is suspect because of this . i will say it one more time , check the ingredients . i have come up with this fictional scenario to share with you . again , fictional . let\u2019s say i really want to make some money off of stupid people . people who believe everything they hear on facebook or just the internet and advertising in general . how can i profit from this ? first i have to create a company which is very easy to do . a product ? i realize most people love burgers , not just stupid people , so i want to create a plant-based burger that tastes and feels like a real beef burger . the goal is to get in on this blitz of new plant-based meat alternatives entering the market and take advantage of people who do not read labels . i hire a research and development crew and let them know what i want . they play around in the kitchen and come up with something they believe is going to be the next best thing . this is the recipe they come up with . for every eight-ounce burger , we use eight ounces of ground beef ( cow ) , 1/2 teaspoon pea protein , 1/4 teaspoon beet powder . contains less than 2% of the following milk powder , soy sauce , whey , natural seasoning , liquid smoke , and dehydrated egg protein . abracadabra , our new plant-based burger is born ! now it is time to take this burger to the market . on the label , i will make sure our advertising team puts plant-based and all-natural in big bold words . the package will be green , white , and have plants all along the border . the commercial would say something like , \u201cgrills and sizzles just like a real burger but made with plants\u201d . would it sell ? probably . this would all be legal for me to do , i think . maybe i would need to add some onions or peppers in there . i don\u2019t really want to look up the laws of what it takes to call a food plant-based . i don\u2019t know the percentages . perhaps that can be a future project . i think you get my point by now . what we all need to take away from this is our health is not what these companies are thinking about when they design the labels on their products or with the ingredients they choose to put in the product itself . money is all these companies care about . the cheaper they make the product the more money they make . after all , the stock price must go higher . it must . hopefully , someday this will change , but this is where we are now . from now on when you are picking up a product i encourage you to ask it this \u201cwhat are you hiding from me ? \u201d","completion": " The topic of labeling foods as \"plant-based\" and what it truly means reminds me of the deceptive advertising tactics used by marketers in the past, such as the \"made with real fruit\" scam. It's evident that commercials, advertisements, and food labels are designed to deceive consumers, although we should be aware of this fact. So why do we still fall for their tricks? Perhaps it's due to catchy jingles, loyalty rewards, repetitive exposure, or simply a lack of knowledge. Unfortunately, the truth is that the food industry is built on manipulation and confusion, with no strict laws governing what can be considered \"plant-based.\"\n\nAs the popularity of the plant-based diet increases, many companies have begun changing their marketing strategies. They now incorporate small plant-based logos or explicitly state on their packaging that the product is plant-based, even if it still contains non-plant-based ingredients. Although I hate to admit it, they have the right to do so within the current regulatory framework. The system is designed to play tricks on us and there seems to be little inhibitions towards deceptive advertising and labeling practices. As long as there is some form of plant ingredient in the food, it can be labeled as plant-based, comparable to how Sunny D, despite its claims, only contains 2% concentrated orange juice, instead consisting primarily of high fructose corn syrup.\n\nReflecting back on my childhood in the 80s, I recall Sunny D being labeled as orange juice instead of a fruit drink. It appears that progress in accurately labeling food products can be slow. These illusions can be especially challenging for individuals who are genuinely vegan or strictly adhere to a plant-based diet. Many products that sport a plant-based logo on the front still contain ingredients like eggs and milk, but technically, they remain plant-based according to advertising terminology. It is essential to always check the ingredients and not blindly trust what a company claims.\n\nWhen encountering a new product of interest, I find myself asking, \"What are you trying to conceal from me?\" Consequently, I resort to using my phone as a magnifying glass, zooming in on the tiny ingredient labels. Frequently, I come across milk powder as one of the most common hidden ingredients. This tends to happen in cereals and snacks with added seasonings. If you plan on purchasing flavored chips or snacks, the only viable option is to scrutinize the label before making the purchase. For example, Doritos contains various milk-based ingredients such as cheese, milk, buttermilk, and whey, which makes it unsuitable for me. Instead, I opt for baked chips with simple seasonings or plain varieties, knowing that I can create amazing flavors at home.\n\nMisleading packaging is also prevalent among many loaves of bread, which can contain milk, butter, eggs, or lard. Noodles and pasta often have eggs included in their recipes. Another deceptive practice involves orange juice enriched with omega-3, where the omega-3 is derived from fish oil. Although an odd combination, it exists. Therefore, anything enriched with omega-3 raises suspicions, prompting a careful examination of the ingredients list.\n\nAllow me to provide a fictional scenario to illustrate the potential for exploitation in the market. Suppose I desired to profit from people's na\u00efvet\u00e9, those who unquestioningly believe everything they see on social media, the internet, and in advertising. How could I achieve this? First, I would establish a company, a straightforward process. Then, I would develop a plant-based burger that mimics the taste and texture of real beef. The goal would involve capitalizing on the growing trend of plant-based meat alternatives while taking advantage of those who neglect to read labels. I would assemble a research and development team and provide them with a clear objective. Through experimentation in the kitchen, they would concoct a recipe that meets my requirements. For every eight-ounce burger patty, the recipe would include eight ounces of ground beef (cow), 1/2 teaspoon of pea protein, and 1/4 teaspoon of beet powder. Additionally, it would contain less than 2% of ingredients such as milk powder, soy sauce, whey, natural seasonings, liquid smoke, and dehydrated egg protein. Voil\u00e0! Our new plant-based burger is created.\n\nTo appeal to consumers, I would emphasize \"plant-based\" and \"all-natural\" prominently on the packaging, accompanied by a green and white color scheme adorned with images of plants along the border. Commercials would boast about its ability to grill and sizzle like a real burger, all the while being made with plants. Would it sell? Most likely. I believe this endeavor would be legal, although I may need to include some onions or peppers in the recipe to meet specific regulations. However, I must confess that I have not yet researched the laws and labeling requirements surrounding the term \"plant-based.\" This investigation could be a future project to explore further. Nevertheless, I trust you comprehend the underlying point. Food companies prioritize their profits over our health. The cheaper they can make the product, the more money they can generate, consequently driving up their stock prices. Unfortunately, this is the current state of affairs. Going forward, I encourage you to question every product you come across, asking, \"What are you hiding from me?\" END"}

uncertainty .","completion": " As an infectious disease epidemiologist, it is my duty to provide information on the transmission dynamics of the virus and how it relates to social distancing measures. There are two aspects of these measures that I believe need to be clarified.\n\nFirstly, it is important to understand that we are still in the early stages of this epidemic. Even with social distancing measures in place, we will continue to see an increase in cases and deaths both globally and within our communities. It is normal to feel discouraged in the face of these challenges, but it is crucial to remember that the measures are indeed effective and necessary. We must remain calm and united as we face this formidable enemy. This is not a matter of opinion, but rather the unforgiving math of epidemics, which we, as epidemiologists, have dedicated our lives to understanding.\n\nSecondly, while social distancing measures have been well-received, we must also consider the impact within household groups. While these measures reduce contact with society at large, they often increase contact within households. This seemingly insignificant detail has profound implications for disease transmission dynamics. Even a small additional connection between groups, such as social dinners or unnecessary trips, can negate the effectiveness of these measures. It is crucial to perceive our families as a single unit - if one person puts themselves at risk, everyone in the unit is at risk. Seemingly small social chains can rapidly become complex and interconnected. Epidemiological data consistently demonstrates the consequences of these interconnected chains, which must not be underestimated.\n\nUnlike personal measures like hand-washing, social distancing measures require collective effort on a societal level. They demand sustained action before we witness tangible results. It may be difficult to grasp how a seemingly innocent gathering can undermine the entire framework of our public health intervention, but the reality is that it can. We cannot cheat this virus. There is no room for complacency or unnecessary breaches of social distancing measures. Our communities have made significant strides, and it is through the continued commitment and resolve of individuals that we will overcome this outbreak. The consequences of unwise choices can be severe, and this virus does not forgive such behavior.\n\nAs this epidemic progresses, there may be moments where we question the effectiveness of our efforts and feel tempted to deviate from the prescribed measures. However, it is imperative that we remain informed, understand the importance of maintaining these measures, and continue to work together as a community. Let us persevere in these uncertain times, knowing that our collective choices will determine the outcome of this crisis. END"}

In today's competitive job market, it is essential to stand out from the crowd and make a lasting impression on potential employers. While you may have heard this advice repeatedly, I would like to emphasize its significance and provide further insight.\n\nWhen applying for a position, it is common to encounter individuals who prioritize quantity over quality. These applicants often fail to include a cover letter, or worse, submit a letter addressed to another company. Another red flag is a generic cover letter filled with impersonal \"stats and facts.\" For instance, boasting about a 300% sales increase when the job does not require sales expertise. These oversights instantly give away their lack of effort and genuine interest.\n\nA well-crafted cover letter should begin by introducing yourself as a human being. By saying, \"My name is X, and I am passionate about Y,\" you establish a personal connection. The specific nature of Y is not of utmost importance, but it demonstrates that you genuinely care about something. If you can align your passion with the company you are applying to, you will have a head start before the employer even examines your CV. The cover letter should effectively convey why you desire to work for the company, highlighting your interests and how they align with what the organization has to offer. It is also beneficial to mention personal areas of interest, including extracurricular projects or experiences from university. For example, mentioning a data science course you took at university and how it sparked your love for the field. Ultimately, your cover letter should not just sell your skill set as a commodity; rather, it should showcase your personality and demonstrate that you are a well-rounded individual.\n\nMoving on to the resume, you must understand that relying solely on your educational background can easily make your resume blend in with others. Universities often produce graduates with similar profiles, varying mainly in grades or specific majors. To make your resume stand out, consider the following elements:\n\n1. Introduction: The introduction in your resume should differ from that of your cover letter. It should briefly present generic facts about yourself in concise sentences. For example, you could mention your growing desire to work in the field of computer science and how your time at university taught you valuable skills like time management and the importance of thoughtful problem-solving.\n\n2. Appropriate Skills: Avoid listing papers or projects solely ranked by grades. Instead, focus on relevant skills that align with the company you are applying to. If data science plays a significant role in the company, include a couple of relevant papers or projects. However, be mindful of not overwhelming the reader with excessive information.\n\n3. Projects: Emphasize the importance of showcasing projects in your resume. This is potentially the most significant aspect that sets successful software graduates apart from others. By undertaking quality projects, you can instantly distinguish yourself from other candidates. Create a free account on GitHub and become actively involved. Having multiple projects on a single \"active\" GitHub account allows the employer to explore various areas of your work, which may contain hidden gems of significance. But what defines a \"quality\" project? A quality project goes beyond following tutorials. While it's commendable to demonstrate your ability to learn a new language or concept through tutorials, it is far more impressive to apply that knowledge to create something unique and innovative. For instance, I once came across a graduate software engineer who was passionate about the indigenous language of New Zealand, the red M\u0101ori. They used the Google Maps API to rename all of New Zealand's street names with their the red M\u0101ori equivalents. Although this project may not be groundbreaking in terms of technical complexity, it provided valuable insight into the candidate's character and dedication. As a native of New Zealand, the red M\u0101ori holds significant cultural importance, and this candidate's effort to utilize their skills for such a purpose spoke volumes about their character.\n\nIn conclusion, the cover letter and resume are vital tools in making a positive impression when applying for a job. By crafting a personalized and engaging cover letter, you can effectively showcase your personality and demonstrate why you are an ideal fit for the company. Additionally, leveraging quality projects and relevant skills within your resume can help differentiate you from other applicants. Remember, it is not just about the technical aspects; it is about showcasing your unique qualities and genuine passion. END"}

jen good question\u2026when i\u2019m feeling creative it\u2019s when i feel connected . and it could be connected deeply to myself , to someone else , to an idea . i know the difference between being connected and disconnected because i\u2019ve spent a lot of my life being disconnected . creativity to me also means being uninhibited . in traditional ways , no i haven\u2019t always been touched by creativity , but in other ways , yes . creativity to me is being deeply connected to my imagination . annie you\u2019ve been writing since you were a kid , same as me . so do you feel like you\u2019ve always had this creativity in you from the get-go ? jen yes , from the get-go . before my dad died i was writing stories , when i was 6 , 7 , 8\u2026 then i felt like there was so much pressure because everyone was like , \u201cjennifer is going to be a writer . \u201d so as i got older , like in high school , i got resentful , like , \u201cdon\u2019t tell me what i\u2019m going to do . \u201d i had studied poetry at nyu , my mom suggested i write for tv and i was like , \u201cno , i want to be an actor , stop telling me what to do . \u201d annie but did you love writing ?

It was a revelation that left me wondering why we hadn't known about each other sooner. It turns out that a simple letter change in our family name at Ellis Island had kept us apart. Nevertheless, after finally meeting, I took Jennifer's best-selling book, \"On Being Human,\" with me on vacation to Rimini, Italy. While lounging on the beaches, I listened to the audiobook she had personally recorded, allowing me to truly get to know my newfound cousin through her own voice. I was captivated by our conversation about creativity, which I had the pleasure of conducting via Instagram Live.\n\nDuring our discussion, I asked Jennifer what creativity meant to her and if she had always been in touch with it. Her response was profound, highlighting that creativity for her is a state of being connected, whether it's with oneself, others, or an idea. She acknowledged that she hadn't always been in touch with creativity in traditional ways but recognized her deep connection to her imagination as an essential aspect of her creative journey.\n\nJennifer, much like myself, has been writing since childhood. However, she admitted to feeling pressure when people labeled her as a future writer. This pressure, coupled with her desire to rebel against being told what to do, led her to pursue acting instead. Reflecting on those years, Jennifer realized that her fascination with being an actor stemmed more from a desire for fame and attention rather than a genuine passion for the craft.\n\nWe delved further into the concept of creativity and the realization that we are all born creative. Jennifer spoke passionately about how creativity manifests in various aspects of our lives, from everyday behaviors and interactions to how we present ourselves and even in the things we make. It became evident that for both of us, creativity is a deeply personal and interconnected element of our existence.\n\nAs our conversation progressed, we touched upon Jennifer's experience with hearing loss and how she learned to read lips. She explained that she relied on lip-reading as her hearing loss progressed, eventually becoming essential for her communication. Interestingly, Jennifer mentioned that she believes many people are now realizing the importance of lip-reading, especially due to the prevalence of mask-wearing during these times.\n\nShifting gears, we discussed Jennifer's current writing journey. She shared that although she hasn't been actively writing since the release of her book, she recognizes the need to make time for it. Jennifer acknowledged that she thrives in an environment free from distractions, one that allows her to fully focus on her writing. We mused over the significance of deadlines and Jennifer expressed how external deadlines often motivate her to produce her best work.\n\nJennifer's book, \"On Being Human,\" originated from a blog she started twelve years ago, titled \"The Manifest-Station.\" Writing essays and sharing them online led her to connect with an agent who recognized her talent and saw the potential for a book.\n\nWe also explored Jennifer's latest endeavor, a podcast she co-hosts called \"What Are You Bringing?\" The podcast centers around conversations with her best friend, Alicia Easter, discussing what individuals bring to life. Although there won't be any actual food involved, the podcast is metaphorically likened to a virtual barbecue.\n\nIn terms of advice that has stuck with Jennifer, she mentioned a quote from Wayne Dyer: \"Don't die with your music still in you.\" She emphasized the importance of living intentionally and allowing oneself to be self-expressed. Jennifer admitted that while she believes she is already living her truth to a great extent, there are still areas where she feels she is holding herself back. She is determined to fully unleash her creativity and share the untapped music within her.\n\nWhen asked about her definition of success, Jennifer expressed that she does feel successful, particularly in terms of living authentically and speaking her truth. However, she acknowledged a desire for greater financial success to afford a more substantial home. Ultimately, she finds solace in knowing that she has been true to herself each day.\n\nIn conclusion, my conversation with Jennifer Mastiff was inspiring and heartfelt. Her insights into creativity, personal growth, and living authentically left a lasting impression on me. It was a privilege to connect with my newfound cousin on such a meaningful level.

The news of his passing has left a deep sadness among his fans who have cherished his music over the years. Amidst the devastating impact of COVID-19, many of us held onto hope that he would overcome this illness. Originally from Haywood, Illinois, John Prince's musical journey began when he learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. His talents were nurtured at the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, a fact not widely known. It is worth mentioning that John Prince served as an army veteran in Germany in 1966 before eventually settling in Chicago in the late 1960s. During his time working for the US Postal Service, he pursued songwriting as a beloved hobby, which eventually paved his path to success.\n\nRenowned film critic Roger Ebert recognized Prince's talent early on, stating in a 1970 Chicago Sun-Times article, \"he sings rather quietly, and his guitar work is good, but he doesn't show off. He starts slow. But after a song or two, even the drunks in the room begin to listen to his lyrics. And then he has you.\" These words aptly capture the captivating essence of Prince's musical prowess that transcended audiences and captivated hearts.\n\nAllow me to share my personal top three favorite songs by the late legend:\n\n1. \"That's the Way the World Goes Round\": This poignant song struck a chord with me when I first heard it in the early 90s at the tender age of eight. Its simplicity and raw emotion resonated deeply, and the flute harmony and shuffling beat added a beautiful touch. I vividly recall finding the lyrics, \"naked as the eyes of a clown,\" incredibly amusing at the time.\n\n2. \"Angel from Montgomery\": This timeless classic from his self-titled 1971 album holds a special place in my heart. As a musician and keyboardist, I appreciate the groovy and straightforward intro showcased by the Hammond organ, blending seamlessly with the piano, guitar, and John's raspy voice. Its lasting appeal speaks volumes about the song's enduring quality.\n\n3. \"Dear Abby\": Another childhood favorite of mine, this song's simplistic storytelling and tongue-in-cheek lyrics captured my imagination. Lines like \"my feet are too long, my hair's falling out, and my rights are all wrong\" and \"my friends they all tell me that I've no friends at all\" offered sage advice disguised as humor, reminiscent of the wisdom my late grandmother would have imparted during my awkward teenage years. This track, featured on the 1973 album Sweet Revenge, continues to resonate.\n\nAs I perused tributes to John Prince on Twitter, I stumbled upon a powerful response from Han if Abderrahim, editor of Gen mag. His heartfelt homage served as a poignant reminder of Prince's impact on countless lives. In my home studio, I took a moment to raise a glass of Evan Williams to Mr. Prince and recorded a short video of myself playing his captivating song on the piano. You can watch it here, as I pay my respects to \"That's the Way the World Goes 'Round.\" John, thank you for the cherished memories you've left behind. In the comments below, I invite you to share your favorite John Prince songs\u2014I would be honored to hear them. END"}

If you have an exciting idea for a startup, it is essential to consider the reasons for having a co-founder. This article will summarize some key advantages.\n\nLower Risks and Shared Responsibility: When two or more people are responsible for a startup, both the gains and losses are shared. Having a co-founder means that the burden of the business does not solely rest on one person's shoulders. This shared responsibility reduces personal risks and ensures that the progress of the venture is not jeopardized by the burnout of a single individual.\n\nAccess to Funding: While securing investments from angel investors and venture capitalists can be challenging, having a co-founder can increase the possibility of receiving funding. In the initial stages, bootstrapped companies can benefit from financial support from friends, family, and personal loans. While this should not be the primary motivation for seeking a co-founder, it is an added bonus for bootstrapped startups.\n\nMoral Support: Starting a business can be isolating, and having a co-founder provides much-needed moral support. It is essential to have someone who understands the obstacles and challenges that the company is facing and still offers support. Loneliness can adversely impact mental health, leading to depression, anxiety, and poor decision-making. Having a co-founder can counteract these negative effects and provide encouragement and motivation.\n\nComplementary Skills: A co-founder can bring a unique set of skills and expertise to the table, which complements your own abilities. This allows for more work to be done without significantly increasing costs. For example, if you excel in administration and have a great idea for an app, you may need a co-founder who specializes in app development or marketing. This partnership ensures that all crucial roles within the company are filled, leading to a more successful venture.\n\nAttracting Investors: Multiple founders tend to be more appealing to investors. The presence of a co-founder shows that someone else believes in your idea and is willing to invest their time and skills. Investors may see this as a vote of confidence and consider the startup more seriously. Additionally, the camaraderie and commitment displayed by co-founders can be a powerful force that drives investors' interest.\n\nFinding the Right Co-founder: When looking for a co-founder, it is vital to find someone who shares your values and aligns with your vision. They don't have to be your soulmate personally, but they should be the soulmate of your business. It is also essential to clearly define the skills and qualities you are seeking in a co-founder and prioritize them according to your startup's needs. Consider individuals with different backgrounds and expertise that complement your own.\n\nStarting your journey as a founder is an important decision, and finding the right co-founder is a crucial step towards success. Take your time, explore your network of friends, and consider online platforms, networking events, and industry-specific gatherings to meet potential co-founders. Be sure to have open and honest discussions about roles, responsibilities, and expectations, and create a formal agreement to protect everyone involved.\n\nRemember, finding the ideal co-founder requires careful consideration and investment \u2013 it is not a task to rush through. Take the time to find the right fit and build a strong foundation for your startup's future success.\n\nSubscribe to DDI Intel to gain access to expert views and insights in the startup industry.\n\nIf you would like more specific information on any of the topics discussed in this article, please leave a comment, and we will be happy to provide further guidance.

introducing a monetized alternative to Twitter, providing writers with new opportunities for short form posts. In a recent post on the Medium Creator Hub, Michelle Lego delves into the details of these changes. Medium's short form options offer writers, particularly those with a following, the ability to perform similar functions to a tweet while potentially earning payment through Medium's partner program. This article explores how writers can leverage Medium's new short form writing functions to expand their reach, create more content, and increase their earnings.\n\nLet's start with the basics - what exactly is a short form post, and how can you create one? Short form posts are Medium articles that consist of 150 words or fewer. Given that the average English word is approximately 4.9 characters long, a short form article would be around 735 characters. Comparatively, Twitter currently limits tweets to 280 characters, meaning that short form Medium articles can be about 2.5 times longer than a tweet. Short form articles typically take only one to two minutes to read.\n\nWhy the 150-word limit? Any article longer than 150 words will be displayed with a \"read more\" button on Medium. By keeping your articles under this word count, Medium ensures that they will be displayed in their entirety on your profile or the landing page of your publication. Readers can consume the entire short form post without having to click through to a second page. While you have the option to write short form posts longer than 150 words, adhering to this cut-off will allow your post to be displayed in full without the need for a \"read more\" button.\n\nMedium has hinted at new short form options since announcing significant platform changes in mid-2020. However, one recent surprise was the revelation that the systems for creating short form posts have been live for months. If you follow Medium's in-house publications, you might have already come across these posts, with their usage dating back to at least July 2020.\n\nCreating a short form post is simple. As explained in the Medium Creator Hub, you begin by starting a new story. Instead of including a headline and photo at the beginning, you bold the first sentence. From there, you write your story as you would for a conventional article, ideally keeping it under 150 words. Tags can be added just like with any other Medium story.\n\nSo, what should you include in your short form posts? The possibilities are vast. Any content that you believe provides value to your audience is suitable. Medium advises that \"variation - and consistency within that variation - is the key when it comes to publishing short form.\" Short form posts can be used to share noteworthy stories from other Medium writers, discuss breaking news or industry announcements in real-time, highlight older stories with newfound relevance, quickly respond to other writers' pieces, organize and summarize your recent work, share off-platform articles, or showcase a photo or video. Additionally, short form posts can be employed to tease upcoming stories, generating excitement and growing your audience.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it is highly recommended to tag other writers in your short form posts and mention stories by tagging them as well. This allows you to directly engage with other writers, promote their work to your audience, and foster a sense of community.\n\nWhat are the benefits of creating short form posts on Medium? Firstly, they are incredibly easy and fast to create. With a short form post comprising only 150 words, the writing process takes minimal time. Consequently, you can swiftly respond to breaking news events or increase your content output by publishing more frequently.\n\nAnother advantage is that short form posts facilitate curation. As Tim Denying aptly stated, audiences seek curated content. As a creator, your role sometimes involves generating content from scratch. However, acting as a curator is equally valuable. Short form posts enable you to gather the best content from your work and other sources that resonate with your audience. By selecting and sharing this content with proper attribution, you provide immense value to your audience.\n\nMonetization is another attractive aspect of short form posts. If you choose to restrict access to your post through Medium's paywall, it becomes monetized, just like any other Medium post if you are part of the Medium partner program. While short form posts are brief, and therefore unlikely to generate extensive reading time, I have found that my short form posts, with an audience of over 5,000 followers on Medium, earn around $0.25 to $2.00 each. Writing these short form posts is akin to being compensated approximately $1 for each tweet.\n\nDespite the notion that curation is less prioritized on the new Medium, short form posts remain eligible for curation. Furthermore, you can publish them in publications, whether your own or another on the platform.\n\nLastly, short form posts provide an avenue for connecting with other writers and readers. By tagging other writers in your short form posts, you initiate a notification system that allows you to engage with them, express your appreciation for their work, promote their content to your audience, and foster a sense of community.\n\nOverall, short form posts are an excellent medium for experimentation. Due to their brevity, they are quick to create and consume, making them ideal for testing new ideas. If your audience responds positively, you can expand on the concept and develop long-form content. Conversely, if the response is less favorable, you have only invested one to two minutes of your audience's time.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following example of a recent short form post: (insert example here).\n\nIn conclusion, Medium's short form posts serve as a monetized and promoted version of Twitter. They share many similarities with tweets and offer the opportunity to earn income. Short form posts are effortless to write, providing you the ability to experiment with new ideas and highlight relevant work - whether created by yourself or others. With the potential to curate content, engage with writers and readers, and benefit from Medium's paywall END"}

\u201d when we know our character\u2019s goals , we can stop them . making it incredibly hard for them to get what they want by setting up their conflict . conflict can be split into internal and external conflict . i\u2019d learned internal conflict was the emotional aspect of my character . it can come from my character\u2019s backstory . how she grew up , different experiences in her life , phobias , likes , dislikes , and wants . it shapes how she will react to certain situations when the pressure is on . external conflict is the part of the book world i create for my story people . the main characters are marooned on a deserted island or live on a new planet that\u2019s going to explode in 30 days . this conflict holds your characters together in a bubble . they need to react to their story world\u2019s limitations and benefits . reviewing conflict with jordan in her class helped me re-assess my pressure and conflict . my overwhelm with my first draft and getting it done had me losing my way down the \u201crabbit hole . \u201d this , jordon explained to us , is a way to avoid writing mistakes . with advice from jordan , i took an honest look at my conflict . first , i wrote down what my main character wants ( goals . ) next , i wrote down ways to stop my main character from getting what she wants . along with writing down her response to these pressures based on her internal and external conflict . i also went over conflict and pressure between my characters and their individual responses . then i started my outline . i reviewed the scenes in my story to determine what i could keep , tweak , or delete while brainstorming new scenes . and of course , i\u2019m writing again . luckily , i hadn\u2019t finished my story . i wasn\u2019t querying or getting rejection letters . i was in a dark , veiled place of writing my first draft . my eyesight and sense of direction were obscured . receiving feedback from jordan opened up fresh conflict for my story that i\u2019d overlooked . i had to work at re-assessing and improving my story\u2019s conflict . all of that evaluating and problem-solving was worth seeing a new story shape that i\u2019m more excited to write about . i\u2019m learning , and i\u2019m thankful for those lessons , even if it happened 50 , 000 words into my process . because now , it feels more like the sun is breaking through the fog of dark clouds around my work in progress . my eyes focus , revealing a more precise picture to follow .","completion": " One method of evaluating conflict within your work in progress, as stated by Cheryl St. John, the author of \"Writing with Emotion, Tension, and Conflict,\" is to avoid attempting to add conflict after writing the book. Insufficient conflict could result in manuscript rejection. It is therefore crucial to seek objective, professional feedback about one's story idea. In my case, despite already having 50,000 words into my first draft, I realized that it still lacked proper conflict and required improvement. The lack of guidance and doubt surrounding my work prompted me to seek advice and solutions.\n\nAfter engaging in discussions about the structure of my book idea with my writing class led by author Catherine Jordan, I became aware of what was missing\u2014more conflict. Conversations with Jordan provided me with a sense of direction and understanding of my book's structure, helping me identify where I had deviated. Objective feedback allowed me to gain perspective on the weaknesses of my first draft by reviewing my classmates' book structures and premises.\n\nJordan's guidance was both polite and encouraging. She emphasized the need to \"increase my pressure\" and highlighted the importance of incorporating pressure throughout my story. Pressure, as I discovered, is a vital component of story structure\u2014a single element among seven others necessary when constructing a premise that gives the story direction. Jordan stressed the significance of being able to explain and strengthen each aspect of the story structure. This requires extensive brainstorming and revision if any aspect falls short.\n\nA day after receiving Jordan's advice, while driving to work, her words resonated with me. I realized that although my story contained pressure, it was too generalized and failed to create unique obstacles for my main character. I needed to figure out how to apply Jordan's advice effectively. The concept of pressure defined how to hinder my character from achieving her goals. We had discussed this aspect during one of our classes when Jordan asked, \"What is conflict?\" According to our collective responses, conflict was defined as the force preventing the main character from reaching their goals. Jordan then prompted us with the question, \"How can I stop my character from getting what they want?\" This led to the realization that when we understand our character's goals, we can impede their progress. Setting up conflict makes it exceptionally difficult for them to achieve what they desire.\n\nThrough Jordan's class, I grasped the distinction between internal and external conflict. Internal conflict encompasses the emotional aspects of my character and arises from her backstory, upbringing, experiences, fears, likes, dislikes, and desires. It shapes her reactions when faced with difficult situations and pressure. On the other hand, external conflict refers to the challenges presented by the story world I created, such as being marooned on a deserted island or living on an exploding planet. This external conflict binds the characters within a bubble and requires them to respond to the limitations and advantages of their story world.\n\nEngaging with Jordan's class helped me reassess the pressure and conflict within my story. My initial overwhelm and rush to finish the first draft had caused me to lose sight of my direction. Jordan explained that such situations can be avoided to prevent writing mistakes. With her advice, I took an honest look at the conflicts within my story. I began by identifying what my main character wants (goals) and explored ways to prevent her from achieving them. Additionally, I considered her responses to these pressures based on her internal and external conflicts. I also examined the conflicts and pressure between my characters and their individual reactions. Subsequently, I started outlining my story, evaluating which scenes to keep, tweak, or delete while brainstorming new ones.\n\nFortunately, I had not completed my story, nor had I begun querying or receiving rejection letters. I was still in the early stages of writing my first draft, residing in a dark and ambiguous place. However, Jordan's feedback shed light on fresh conflicts that I had neglected. Reassessing and improving my story's conflict became crucial. The process of evaluating and problem-solving proved worthwhile as I began to visualize a new story shape that excited me. Each lesson learned, even 50,000 words into my process, helped me navigate the fog of uncertainty surrounding my work in progress. The sun started to break through the dense clouds, and my vision became clearer, revealing a more defined path to follow. END"}

However, maintaining a notebook can prove to be an invaluable tool for organization and memory. As the renowned writer Jack London once advised, \"Keep a notebook. Travel with it, eat with it, sleep with it.\"\n\nPreviously, my notebook-keeping habit lacked structure and efficiency. I would grab whichever notebook was available, creating a disorganized mess. Finding specific notes became an arduous task, rendering my efforts futile. Over the years, I attempted bullet journaling, a creative and flexible approach. Unfortunately, despite its potential, it did not align with my routines. The meticulous setup and fear of making mistakes discouraged regular use. Additionally, arbitrary elements, such as tracking water consumption, felt unnecessary and restrictive.\n\nHowever, a few years ago, an epiphany sparked a change in my approach. Austin Leon's post about his own notebook-keeping practice resonated with me. Inspired, I invested in a large, flexible notebook, similar to the one Leon preferred. Moreover, a quote by Jack London stating that cheap paper and pencil markings are more enduring than memory further solidified my resolution.\n\nNow, instead of striving for artistic layouts and creativity, I focus on using my notebook consistently. It functions as a record rather than a planner, accommodating various needs. If I wish to monitor something, I simply dedicate a page to it, devoid of any unnecessary embellishments like water bubbles. Whenever I attend meetings, conferences, or engage in meaningful conversations, I open my notebook to the next available page and jot down my thoughts. Noteworthy quotes, book summaries, and personal ideas find a home within these pages. Lists, from grocery shopping to bills to pay, also find solace within the notebook's confines. Following the words of Jack London, I diligently capture every stray thought.\n\nAdmittedly, my everyday notebook may never become the visually appealing, well-organized bullet journal some cherish. Nevertheless, it serves its purpose efficiently, catering to my needs. If you also wish to maintain your own everyday notebook, take note of a few guidelines. First, select a notebook that is of sufficient size but not excessively large. The choice may vary depending on personal preferences and practicality, such as whether it needs to fit in a pocket or bag. The key is to have it with you at all times. Train yourself to record your notes, disregarding the need for immediate organization. Just let the ideas flow onto the pages, ensuring you date each entry. In case you have ample space remaining on a page, demarcate your thoughts with a line. \n\nHowever, taking action on these notes is equally important. Given that all my life's notes reside in one notebook, I occasionally need to address specific items. By reviewing my notes on a weekly basis, I can act upon necessary tasks, make important phone calls, or connect with others. I mark completed items with a highlighter, providing a visual cue of their resolution.\n\nIn conclusion, keeping an everyday notebook proves beneficial in our ever-busy lives. It provides a single repository for our thoughts, ideas, and to-do lists, etching them in a tangible form that surpasses our fallible memory. Embrace the practice of carrying a personal notebook, and witness the positive impact it makes on your daily routines and overall productivity. END"}

While it excels in expressing simplistic ideas and trivial matters, it falls short in effectively conveying complex thoughts or emotions. On the other hand, the German language is renowned for its complexity. Its words and phrases may appear unwieldy and lengthy to outsiders, but they possess a unique conciseness capable of describing concepts that might otherwise require extensive explanation or even entire books. For instance, the term \"vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung\" specifically refers to a collective trauma that continues to haunt a nation, particularly in the context of post-World War II German history, when Germany diligently sought to comprehend and address its descent into fascism. This word not only captures the mood of such a period but also encapsulates the process of working through a difficult past.\n\nIn contrast, French is often regarded as the most beautiful of all languages. Words and phrases in French strike a harmonious balance, not as cumbersome as German, yet avoiding the stunted or aggressive undertones sometimes found in American English. French has the ability to condense complex thoughts or ideas into a single word or a concise string of words, allowing for the identification of concepts that might otherwise perplex us throughout our lifetimes. Furthermore, French possesses the unique talent of transforming something as challenging to articulate as collective paranoia into a romantic notion. This is evident in the case of \"folie \u00e0 deux,\" which translates to \"madness for two\" in English. It describes the phenomenon whereby a person suffering from a delusional belief transmits it to others. While the English description of \"shared psychosis\" simplifies this concept, it fails to capture the inherent romanticism enshrined within the French phrase. Regrettably, American English lacks an equivalent term or expression that carries the same depth of meaning, particularly on a national scale. The phrase \"mass delusion,\" for instance, accounts for a group experiencing collective hysteria, but it fails to highlight its origin. Moreover, it lacks precision, often confined to smaller groups and brief moments in time. From the Salem witch trials to sightings of \"evil clowns\" in small towns throughout the United States in 2016, the concept of mass delusion has been applied to various situations, without fully grasping the extent of our prolonged madness or the generational fear that pervades our society.\n\nAmerica breeds a distinct kind of madness that transcends societal boundaries, afflicting people from all walks of life. It permeates the highest echelons of power and trickles down to the masses, representing a unique form of redistribution that characterizes our nation. This condition is not a recent development born out of a national panic, but a persistent state of affairs ingrained in the fabric of this country since its inception. The last four years, however, have brought this madness into sharp relief. It became apparent to me in 2015 when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president. At that time, there were moments in media coverage that revealed an intense disdain for him, transcending political party lines. Prominent figures such as George Will labeled Trump a counterfeit Republican, while the National Review dedicated an entire issue titled \"Against Trump\" to vociferously attacking him. MSNBC, positioning itself as the anti-Trump network, obsessively covered his every word, and its prominent host, Rachel Maddow, drew parallels between Trump and Adolf Hitler on her show and in interviews. This collective derangement quickly spread across America, manifesting in public spectacles. In February 2017, witches began publicly hexing Trump in rituals, casting what they called a binding spell to ensure the failure of his actions. This continued for months, resulting in the formation of a formal online group named #magicresistance. As expected in America, no action goes without a corresponding and often absurd reaction. Christians responded to these hexes with coordinated prayer campaigns, while the online forum 4chan created its own occult belief system, the \"Cult of Key,\" initially to mock these rituals but eventually spawning its own minor religion centered around \"meme magic.\" It is crucial to note that Trump, his campaign, and his presidency are not unique in this regard. When I mention seeing something in Trump, I am not referring to the man himself but to the response Americans have toward him and similar figures.\n\n\nConservatives have coined the term \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" to capture the generalized paranoia that arises in response to his mere existence. However, this phenomenon is not exclusive to Trump alone. It was initially coined by political commentator Charles Kraut hammer to describe a remark made by Howard Dean about George W. Bush. Center-left news outlets later transformed it into \"Obama Derangement Syndrome.\" It appears that each new president drives the nation further into derangement, amplifying the cycle of self-inflicted harm during each election. Yet, the events of this past year may epitomize the pinnacle of American derangement, albeit temporarily.\n\nWith a global pandemic affecting every nation, America finds itself unraveling in peculiar and unprecedented ways. Despite widespread state mandates that businesses shut down or operate at minimal capacity, the government provided its citizens with only one stimulus check of $1,200. This sparked armed protests in which demonstrators stormed state capitols demanding the reopening of their respective states. The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ignited widespread protests and counter-protests, with one particularly striking image emerging a little over a week after her passing. In response to the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, Trump supporters began holding prayer sessions in front of the Supreme Court. In this poignant photograph captured by a staff photographer for The New York Times, Trump supporters stood in stark contrast to a woman lying on the ground, overcome with tears over Ginsburg's death. The following day, evangelicals gathered at the Washington Monument for a prayer rally in support of Israel, treating the monument as if it were the Western Wall, symbolizing the connection between one of Judaism's holiest sites and the founding of America.\n\nProtests, triggered by the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers, have persistently continued since May. This incident may very well be the defining moment of 21st-century America. A police station was burned, cities deployed chemical weapons against civilian protesters while dishonestly denying their use, and Americans established their own autonomous zones. At a certain point, however, the lines blurred, and the motives behind these protests became unclear. In June, after protesters across the country tore down Confederate monuments, conservative residents of South Philadelphia initiated protests to protect a statue of Christopher Columbus\u2014despite the absence of any threats to deface or dismantle it. Around the same time, caravans of Trump supporters began parading through cities and suburbs nationwide. The South Philadelphia protest witnessed police standing by as clashes erupted on the streets, while the caravans culminated in an October 31st protest during which a Texas caravan harassed and attacked a Biden campaign bus, and another group shut down the Mario Cuomo Bridge in New Jersey.\n\nAlas, the English language lacks phrases akin to \"folie \u00e0 deux\" or \"vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung\" that capture the essence of this feeling, moment, or the process of a nation losing its sanity. We can merely approximate the experience by labeling it as \"America.\" After all, America represents more than a physical place or a mere system of boundaries; it constitutes a collective psychological condition afflicting its 328 million inhabitants. America, like an approaching light at the end of a tunnel, soon reveals itself as the headlights of an oncoming truck, swift in its approach, ready to run you over and leave you for dead. Yet, despite the incessant onslaught, Americans persist, rising repeatedly, and walking towards it.

This article aims to guide you in training a Deep Lab semantic segmentation model on your own dataset using TensorFlow. Before we delve into the details, let's first understand what Deep Lab is and how it works.\n\nOverview of Deep Lab:\nDeep Lab is a prominent method that employs deep learning for semantic image segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves understanding an image at the pixel level and assigning a label to each pixel, based on shared characteristics among pixels with the same label.\n\nInstallation:\nTo start using Deep Lab with TensorFlow, you can find the implementation on GitHub [link_here]. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and follow the installation instructions provided.\n\nPreparing the Dataset:\nBefore training the Deep Lab model with your own dataset, it is essential to have a clear understanding of your objectives. There are two scenarios to consider:\n\n1. Training the model from scratch:\nIn this scenario, you have the flexibility to define any number of object classes (labels) for segmentation. However, training from scratch can be time-consuming.\n\n2. Using a pre-trained model:\nAlternatively, you can utilize a pre-trained model and update only the classifier weights through transfer learning. This approach significantly reduces the training time compared to training from scratch.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, let's assume your new dataset is named \"PQR.\" Create a new folder named \"PQR\" at \"TensorFlow/models/research/deep lab/datasets/PQR.\" You will need input images and their corresponding pre-segmented ground-truth images for training. The input images should be color images, while the segmented images should be color indexed images.\n\nRefer to the Pascal dataset for guidance on the directory structure:\n- Create a \"dataset\" folder inside \"PQR.\"\n- The \"dataset\" folder should contain the following subdirectories:\n  - \"preimages\": contains input color images in .jpg format.\n - \"segmentation class\": contains semantic segmentation annotations for each input image, serving as the ground truth. These images should be color indexed, with each color index representing a unique class.\n - \"image sets\": contains text files such as \"train.txt,\" \"val.txt,\" and \"trainval.txt,\" which list image names for the training, validation, and combined training/validation sets, respectively.\n\nRemoving Color Maps in Ground Truth Annotations:\nIf your segmentation annotation images are RGB images instead of color indexed images, you can remove the color maps using a Python script. The script should define the RGB-label pairs where, for example, (0, 0, 0) denotes the background and (255, 0, 0) denotes the foreground class. Ensure that the script considers the location of the raw segmentation data (\"new_label_Dir\").\n\nConverting the Dataset to TensorFlow Record:\nMake a copy of the script file \"/dataset/download_and_convert_voc2012.sh\" as \"/dataset/convert_pqr.sh\". Modify the script with appropriate changes. When executed, this script will convert the image dataset into a TensorFlow record and save it at \"./deep lab/datasets/PQR/record.\"\n\nDefining the Dataset Description:\nOpen the \"segmentation_dataset.py\" file located in \"research/deep lab/datasets/.\" Add the necessary code segment to define the description for your \"PQR\" dataset. Specify the number of files in the train folder, validation set, and train/validation set using the file count variables. Additionally, set the number of classes in your dataset and the label to ignore (usually white edges) within the \"ignore_label\" field.\n\nTraining the Model:\nTo train the model on your dataset, execute the \"train.py\" file located in \"research/deep lab/.\" We have provided a script file named \"train-pqr.sh\" that simplifies this process for you. In the script, ensure you specify the number of training iterations (\"sum_iterations\") and the location of the downloaded or pre-trained model (\"--TF_initial_checkpoint\"). The final trained model can be found in the \"train_logic\" directory after training completes.\n\nConclusion:\nCongratulations! You have successfully trained Deep Lab on your dataset. In upcoming articles, we will continue exploring the exciting realm of deep learning and image manipulation. Stay tuned for more insights, and if you found this article helpful, please consider showing your support by clapping. Your encouragement means a lot to me.\n\nPhoto by Nick Karvounis on Unsplash.\nI work as a Research Scientist at Livestock, focusing on deep learning solutions for image generation and editing.

At the age of three, his family moved from Cuba to a predominantly black neighborhood as a result of discriminatory housing practices that segregated the city. They settled in the 48217 zip code, which is now known as Michigan's most polluted area, with a population that is 71% black. The air pollution in this area is so severe that it gives the sky a fiery appearance.\n\nSpecifically, the Martins moved to Boston, a working-class neighborhood situated next to the Marathon Oil refinery and its extensive industrial campus. When they arrived in the 1960s, the refinery consisted of only \"one or two tankers.\" However, it has since grown into a 250-acre tank farm, emitting substantial air pollution. In fact, it has received 15 violation notices from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy since 2013 for exceeding state and federal emissions limits. Despite these violations, Marathon denies any wrongdoing and asserts that it has reduced emissions by 75% over the past two decades, contributing to only 3% of emissions in the area.\n\nNevertheless, Martin witnessed the deterioration of air quality as the refinery expanded throughout the years. He considers himself fortunate to have escaped the worst of it during his youth, as he frequently traveled for sports. Unfortunately, many others in his community were not as lucky. At his 30-year-high school reunion, Martin was struck by the fact that more of his classmates had passed away than were still alive. Many of them had lost their lives to cancer. Additionally, Martin's younger brother David suffered from asthma and juvenile diabetes, both of which have been connected to air pollution. David would often be rushed to the hospital with respiratory issues after spending time outside. Tragically, he succumbed to what Martin describes as \"toxic poisoning\" at the age of 45.\n\nThese heart-wrenching stories are all too familiar in the 48217 community. Within a five-mile radius of Boston, there are four major emitters of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxides, which can lead to respiratory problems and the formation of acid rain. Moreover, the neighborhood is located near Interstate 75, one of the busiest highways in Michigan, and only nine minutes away from the congested Ambassador Bridge, the busiest international border crossing in North America. With plans to open the new Gordie Howe International Bridge next to the Ambassador Bridge in 2020, diesel truck traffic is expected to increase by a staggering 125%.\n\nThe situation in the 48217 zip code exemplifies the environmental injustices faced by marginalized communities. The detrimental health effects caused by air pollution have taken a devastating toll on the residents, resulting in illnesses and premature deaths. It is a somber narrative, underscored by the knowledge that individuals who once exuded joy and zest for life have had it gradually stripped away. To live in a community plagued by such pollutants is a tragic tale that demands urgent attention and remedial action. END"}

You have already demonstrated proficiency in creating habits, and I can assure you of that. You might have numerous habits so ingrained within you that you may not even notice them. Allow me to share some of my personal habits as examples. Every morning, as soon as I wake up, I habitually check my email on my phone. I consistently opt for a pre-packaged protein shake as my morning meal. Immediately after my breakfast protein shake, I make it a point to brush my teeth. During this time, I also check my calendar. When lunchtime arrives, I take the opportunity to indulge in reading on my Kindle. Following my lunch break, I consistently take my vitamins before resuming my work. Whenever I am on my computer, I routinely check my email, Facebook, and Amazon book sales. At 5 p.m. each day, I begin contemplating dinner plans. Before retiring for the night, I adhere to a routine of brushing my teeth, taking my medication, and washing my face once more. These are only a few habits that sprang to mind in just a couple of minutes while composing this post. Habits tend to develop and evolve over time. For instance, I used to habitually check my Medium stats whenever I was on my computer, but that habit has waned lately as my focus has shifted more towards self-publishing than blogging. Additionally, my Kindle habit is relatively new, having developed rather swiftly. Sticky habits often form unconsciously, without conscious thought. Without a doubt, we all possess them. The key lies in understanding the reasons behind the formation of these habits and utilizing that knowledge intentionally. A crucial component is tying habits to specific times or actions. Merely deciding to develop a habit is insufficient. If we desire the habit to stick, it must be associated with a designated time or action. Allow me to emphasize that having a seemingly trivial habit, such as dedicating ten minutes to writing each day, can yield striking results. However, for the habit to endure, it is imperative to determine when exactly this activity will transpire. For example, one could choose to write for ten minutes every day at 8 a.m. or immediately following breakfast. The specific timing is not as crucial as the establishment of clear parameters for the habit. By doing so, we demonstrate a commitment of allocating time specifically for this endeavor. Furthermore, stacking new habits with pre-existing, ingrained ones amplifies their potency. For instance, I plan to write for ten minutes every day at 8 a.m., right after checking my email. Alternatively, I can choose to write for ten minutes each day, immediately after breakfast. My apologies for the mistaken digression. By tying a new habit to a particular action, it often becomes naturally linked to an existing routine. However, if you do not have the practice of consuming breakfast each morning, this habit may possess less staying power. It is essential to acknowledge that resistance is often a manifestation of underlying confusion within the deeper recesses of our brains. Although you may have crafted a simple and straightforward goal, such as writing for ten minutes daily, your unconscious mind may experience confusion. It could be that while you vocalize the desire to pursue the ten-minute habit, your thoughts gravitate toward dedicating an hour to writing. This disparity creates confusion. Similarly, if you plan to write for ten minutes daily at 8 a.m., but habitually rise after 9 a.m., this contradiction results in further confusion. Consequently, you may find yourself perplexed as to why you struggle to commit to the modest goal of writing for a mere ten minutes each day. Ultimately, resistance often masks the deeper confusion prevalent in our unconscious monkey brains. While a more scientifically accurate term may exist, the concept remains clear. It is imperative to provide clear and precise instructions to the monkey brain, which operates at a deeper level. Achieving this clarity can be challenging, given that our aim is to set a minimum requirement rather than a maximum. Writing for an hour daily bears nothing inherently wrong; in fact, that may be the reason behind setting a smaller goal. Nonetheless, it is crucial to fully acknowledge and credit oneself for achieving the small daily goal. Engage in a conversation with your monkey brain, ensuring it fully comprehends this concept. Before binding a habit to an early morning hour, consider the time you genuinely arise from bed. Additionally, ensure that you have genuinely embraced the tiny goal as your actual objective. Now, let us explore the steps to create a new, enduring, and minimal habit. END"}

These libraries employ Python to interact with Google's search functionality effectively. This article aims to shed light on these libraries and share their capabilities with readers. By familiarizing yourself with these libraries, you will have a valuable resource readily available for your future search-related Python API needs. \n\nThe first library we will explore is called \"google search.\" It is a Python library that facilitates efficient Google searches. This library leverages the \"requests\" and \"beautifulsoup4\" libraries to scrape data from Google. To install the library, simply execute the command \"pip install googlesearch-python.\" Note that if you are working with an IDE other than Google Cola, you can omit the exclamation mark at the beginning of the command. After installation, remember to restart the runtime or editor to utilize the newly installed version.\n\nTo perform a basic search using \"google search,\" import the library and then initiate a search on your desired topic. Consider the following code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport google search\n\nsearch = google search.search('Katy Perry')\nprint(search)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will present you with a list of search results related to Katy Perry. It is essential to note that the search method returns a list as its output.\n\nFurthermore, the \"search\" method allows you to control the number of search results and specify the desired language using the \"sum_results\" and \"Lang\" parameters, respectively. For instance, if we want to limit the search results for Katy Perry to five and obtain French results, we can modify the code as follows:\n\n```python\nimport google search\n\nsearch = google search.search('Katy Perry', sum_results=5, Lang='for')\nprint(search)\n```\n\nUpon executing this code, you will receive search results primarily from French websites, restricted to five entries. The output will not be in French but will rather include French websites.\n\nFor a comprehensive review of the source code and more in-depth information about the google search library, please refer to their repository provided below.

To install Jest with NPM, you can run the command:\n\n```\nNPM install --save-dev jest\n```\n\nIf you prefer using yarn, you can run the command:\n\n```\nyarn add --dev jest\n```\n\nAfter installing Jest, you can add or replace a test script in the \"scripts\" block within your package.Jason file. This allows you to run Jest with the command `NPM test`. \n\nIn a Create React App environment, the script will look slightly different as react-scripts is used instead of Jest. However, no changes are needed in this case. \n\nTo verify that everything is working correctly, you can run `NPM test` in your terminal at the root directory of your project. You will enter watch mode and see a prompt indicating \"no tests found related to files changed since last commit\", along with options to run tests in various ways.\n\nNow, let's discuss the best way to introduce tests to your React project before diving into some useful tools.\n\nWhen using Jest, it automatically discovers test files within your project based on their filenames. There are three naming conventions you can adapt to allow Jest to pick up your tests:\n\n1. Any file with a .test.js suffix or a .spec.js suffix. This convention is preferable when a component (e.g., app.js) is accompanied by an app.test.js file in the same directory, keeping them next to each other for easy discoverability and minimizing import statements.\n\n2. Any .js file within __tests__ folders throughout your project. This convention is useful when you have multiple test files for a particular component or component directory. It provides a structured approach, separating tests from components, which is beneficial in larger projects.\n\nThe choice of naming convention depends on your project's specific requirements and preferences.\n\nNow let's write a simple test to demonstrate Jest's syntax. We'll create an app.test.js file in the same directory as app.js. This test will not have any direct relation to app.js at the moment, but it will introduce some key methods of Jest.\n\nHere's an example of the app.test.js file:\n\n```JavaScript\ndescribe('Examining the syntax of Jest tests', () \u2192 {  it('sums numbers', () \u2192 {    expect(1 + 2).coequal(3);\n    expect(2 + 2).coequal(4);\n });});\n```\n\nWhen you save this test and have Jest running in the terminal, you will see the test results similar to the following output:\n\n```\n PASS ./app.test.js\n  Examining the syntax of Jest tests\n    \u2713 sums numbers (5ms)\n```\n\nNow let's break down the example to understand the syntax:\n\n`describe()` is an optional method used to wrap a group of tests and provide a description of the tests conducted within it. The text provided in `describe()` acts as a header in the test results.\n\n`it()` is similar to `describe()` but is used to describe what a test should achieve. It provides a description of the specific test case.\n\n`expect()` and `coequal()` are used in the test itself. `expect()` takes the result of a function, and `coequal()` compares the result of `expect()` with the provided value. An assertion is made, expecting the result to be true. If the result is false, the test fails, and execution stops within the corresponding `it()` block.\n\nJest provides various matchers, such as `contain`, `toBeFalsy`, `match (regex or string)`, and `throw (error)`. To optimize your test syntax, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the full list of matchers documented by Jest.\n\nThe test results are displayed in the terminal, with green ticks indicating success and red crosses indicating failure. In case of failure, detailed information about the failure, including the line number and code where the test failed, is provided.\n\nTo demonstrate the importance of testing two or more sums instead of just one, we'll introduce a `sum()` function and modify the tests. Instead of hard-coding the sums, we'll use the `sum()` function to perform the calculations.\n\nHere's an example of the modified app.test.js file:\n\n```JavaScript\nimport {sum} from './math';\n\ndescribe('Examining the syntax of Jest tests', () \u2192 {  it('sums numbers', () \u2192 {    expect(sum(1, 2)).coequal(3);\n    expect(sum(2, 2)).coequal(4);\n });});\n```\n\nBy making these changes, the tests will still pass successfully. However, if we modify the `sum()` function to always return a hard-coded value of 3, the tests would fail. This illustrates the importance of testing multiple scenarios to ensure the functionality of the code under different conditions. END"}

It is widely accepted that strong coupling is undesirable, while low coupling is desirable. High coupling indicates that modules cannot be easily separated, as their internals are intertwined and intertwined with those of other modules. This situation is often referred to as \"spaghetti\" code, where everything is mixed up together, much like a bowl of tangled spaghetti noodles.\n\nA high degree of coupling can have various negative consequences. Firstly, it makes the code harder to understand, as complex and interconnected relationships are difficult to unravel. Additionally, changes made in one part of the code can have unknown and unpredictable effects in other parts. Moreover, heavily coupled code is challenging to reuse, as it is difficult to extract and integrate into other systems.\n\nThe goal, therefore, should always be to minimize coupling in one's code as much as possible. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that complete decoupling is not feasible or practical. A collection of entirely decoupled modules would serve no purpose as they rely on each other to achieve functionality. Instead, aim for a thin and lightweight coupling between modules.\n\nOne effective way to achieve this is through the use of interfaces. An interface acts as a thin connection between modules, allowing them to communicate without being tightly bound together. Code that is coupled via interfaces is as loosely coupled as possible, resembling a wisp of smoke that can be sensed but not firmly grasped.\n\nTo better illustrate these concepts, let's consider a real-world example. The space shuttle can be seen as a highly coupled system. It consists of a vast number of unique parts that must fit together in very specific ways. These parts are not easily reusable, and if modifications are required, especially to an interface, it often leads to extensive modifications throughout the entire craft. Consequently, the space shuttle serves as an example of a highly coupled system.\n\nConversely, imagine a space shuttle constructed out of Lego pieces. Although it may not be functional, it provides an example of loose coupling. Lego pieces can be easily assembled and disassembled, allowing for effortless changes to the design. This highlights the advantages of low coupling, as modifications can be made without significant repercussions in other areas.\n\nIn summary, striving for uncoupled code offers several benefits. It enhances code readability by maintaining simplicity and avoiding complexity. It promotes code reusability by employing thin interfaces as the sole means of connection. Furthermore, it facilitates code maintenance and adaptability, as changes can be isolated and contained.\n\nTherefore, instead of tightly coupled code, aim for code that is loosely coupled. By doing so, you create code that is easier to comprehend, reusable, and more adaptable to changes in the future. END"}
{"prompt": "tea can give you a lot of energy i was surprised to learn that energy-vise tea can be a great substitute for coffee . before , when i regularly drank coffee , i could drink tea like water . it had no effect on me . but after my coffee detox , i could feel my energy levels skyrocketing before i even finished my cup of tea . tea leaves contain more caffeine ( 3 . 5% ) than coffee beans ( 1 . 1\u20132 . 2% ) . but because of the water temperature used to brew coffee and the number of beans used to make the drink , the average amount of caffeine that ends up in your cup of joe will be higher ( 96mg ) . the average amount of caffeine in black tea is 47mg per serving . but if you like your tea strong , as i do , your cup can contain up to 90mg , which will be almost equal to the average amount in a cup of coffee . you can enjoy more cups during the day because the average amount of caffeine in a cup of tea is two times smaller than in coffee , you can enjoy more cups of the drink during the day . it is recommended by several resources not to exceed 400mg of caffeine per day . that roughly equals four cups of coffee or eight cups of tea . it might be quite hard to drink more than eight cups of tea so you can drink it without worrying about the negative effects of too much caffeine on your health . it would be two times harder to exceed the recommended dosage if you choose to drink tea . but please don\u2019t forget to stay hydrated and drink enough water ! drinking too much can cause bad symptoms , just like coffee though tea has a smaller amount of caffeine , drinking more than 3\u20134 cups can lead to some negative side effects , such as reduced iron absorption increased anxiety and stress troubles falling asleep and poor sleep quality nausea heartburn headaches caffeine dependence i learned that i could drink 2\u20133 cups of tea per day without it having a negative effect on how i feel . but this may vary from person to person since a lot of people are more sensitive to caffeine . it is crucial to listen to your body and cut down your intake if you experience any bad symptoms . you can also consult your doctor if you\u2019re unsure about the amount of caffeine you can tolerate . tea tastes great when my taste buds were spoiled with the amount of coffee i used to consume , i was not too fond of the taste of tea . but when tea became my only option , i grew into loving it . now i\u2019m as excited about my cup of english breakfast as i would be about my almond milk latte . these days i don\u2019t just use tea as a substitute for coffee , but i also crave it every day and drink it as a treat like i used to do with coffee . final thought during my 30 day experiment , i discovered that tea could become a good replacement for coffee . if you\u2019re struggling to cut down your caffeine intake , drinking tea can be a great way to do it . you can easily cut the amount of caffeine you consume in half by replacing your cup of coffee with a cup of tea . this helped me reduce the negative symptoms that were connected with my coffee intake . i still love coffee and consider it a pretty important part of my life . even my bio says i do . i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019m ready to say goodbye to it forever . for now , my goal is to cut down on coffee as much as i can and drink it as a treat a couple of times a month . but for now , i have a great new alternative .","completion": " Tea: A Promising Alternative to Coffee for a Boost of Energy\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to discover that tea can be a powerful substitute for coffee when it comes to providing energy. In the past, I used to drink tea without feeling any effect, but after giving up coffee and undergoing a detox, I noticed a significant boost in my energy levels even before finishing my cup of tea.\n\nWhat sets tea apart is its caffeine content. Tea leaves contain a higher percentage of caffeine (3.5%) compared to coffee beans (1.1-2.2%). However, the brewing process and the quantity of beans used in coffee production result in a higher caffeine concentration in your cup of Joe, averaging around 96\u00a0mg. On the other hand, an average serving of black tea contains 47\u00a0mg of caffeine. If you, like me, enjoy a strong cup of tea, it can contain up to 90\u00a0mg of caffeine, nearly equivalent to the average amount found in a cup of coffee.\n\nOne advantage of tea is that you can indulge in more cups throughout your day. The average amount of caffeine in a cup of tea is half that of coffee, allowing you to enjoy more servings without exceeding the recommended daily caffeine intake of 400\u00a0mg. It's highly unlikely to surpass this limit by consuming more than eight cups of tea in a day, making it a safer choice in terms of caffeine consumption. However, it is essential to stay hydrated and ensure an adequate intake of water. Excessive tea consumption, just like excessive coffee intake, can lead to negative side effects such as reduced iron absorption, increased anxiety, difficulty falling asleep, poor sleep quality, nausea, heartburn, headaches, and caffeine dependence.\n\nI have come to learn that personally, I can comfortably drink 2-3 cups of tea per day without experiencing any adverse effects. However, caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person. It is crucial to pay attention to your body's signals and reduce your intake if you encounter any negative symptoms. If you remain unsure about your caffeine tolerance, consulting your doctor can provide valuable guidance.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how my taste buds adapted to the transition from coffee to tea. Initially, I wasn't particularly enamored with the taste of tea, having been accustomed to the strong flavors of coffee. However, as tea became my primary choice, I developed a genuine appreciation for its unique flavor profile. Now, I find myself as excited about my cup of English breakfast tea as I once was about my almond milk latte. These days, I not only view tea as a coffee substitute but also as a daily treat, just as coffee used to be.\n\nIn conclusion, through my 30-day experiment, I found that tea can successfully serve as a suitable replacement for coffee. If you're struggling to reduce your caffeine intake, switching to tea can be an excellent method to achieve that goal. By simply replacing your cup of coffee with a cup of tea, you can easily cut your caffeine consumption in half. Personally, this change helped alleviate the negative effects associated with my coffee consumption. While I continue to appreciate and prioritize coffee in my life, as stated in my bio, I'm uncertain if I'm ready to bid it farewell forever. For now, my aim is to gradually reduce my coffee intake, reserving it as an occasional indulgence a few times a month. In the meantime, I am grateful to have discovered a remarkable alternative in tea. END"}
{"prompt": "introduction to deep learning what is deep learning and how can i study it ? this is the first article in this series , and is associated with our intro to deep learning github repository where you can find practical examples of many deep learning applications and tactics . read the second article here , the third here , and the fourth here . although normally the \u201cprework\u201d comes before the introduction , i\u2019m going to give the 30 , 000 foot view of the fields of artificial intelligence , machine learning , and deep learning at the top . i have found that this context can really help us understand why the prerequisites seem so broad , and help us study just the essentials . besides , the history and landscape of artificial intelligence is interesting , so lets dive in ! artificial intelligence , machine learning , and deep learning deep learning is a subset of machine learning . machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence . said another way \u2014 all deep learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms , but many machine learning algorithms do not use deep learning . as a venn diagram , it looks like this deep learning refers specifically to a class of algorithm called a neural network , and technically only to \u201cdeep\u201d neural networks ( more on that in a second ) . this first neural network was invented in 1949 , but back then they weren\u2019t very useful . in fact , from the 1970\u2019s to the 2010\u2019s traditional forms of ai would consistently outperform neural network based models . these non-learning types of ai include rule based algorithms ( imagine an extremely complex series of if/else blocks ) heuristic based ais such as a* search constraint satisfaction algorithms like arc consistency tree search algorithms such as minimax ( used by the famous deep blue chess ai ) and more . there were two things preventing machine learning , and especially deep learning , from being successful . lack of availability of large datasets and lack of availability of computational power . in 2018 we have exabytes of data , and anyone with an aws account and a credit card has access to a distributed supercomputer . because of the new availability of data and computing power , machine learning \u2014 and especially deep learning \u2014 has taken the ai world by storm . you should know that there are other categories of machine learning such as unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning but for the rest of this article , i will be talking about a subset of machine learning called supervised learning . supervised learning algorithms work by forcing the machine to repeatedly make predictions . specifically , we ask it to make predictions about data that we ( the humans ) already know the correct answer for . this is called \u201clabeled data\u201d \u2014 the label is whatever we want the machine to predict . here\u2019s an example let\u2019s say we wanted to build an algorithm to predict if someone will default on their mortgage . we would need a bunch of examples of people who did and did not default on their mortgages . we will take the relevant data about these people feed them into the machine learning algorithm ask it to make a prediction about each person and after it guesses we tell the machine what the right answer actually was . based on how right or wrong it was the machine learning algorithm changes how it makes predictions . we repeat this process many many times , and through the miracle of mathematics , our machine\u2019s predictions get better . the predictions get better relatively slowly though , which is why we need so much data to train these algorithms . machine learning algorithms such as linear regression , support vector machines , and decision trees all \u201clearn\u201d in different ways , but fundamentally they all apply this same process make a prediction , receive a correction , and adjust the prediction mechanism based on the correction . at a high level , it\u2019s quite similar to how a human learns . recall that deep learning is a subset of machine learning which focuses on a specific category of machine learning algorithms called neural networks . neural networks were originally inspired by the way human brains work \u2014 individual \u201cneurons\u201d receive \u201csignals\u201d from other neurons and in turn send \u201csignals\u201d to other \u201cneurons\u201d . each neuron transforms the incoming \u201csignals\u201d in some way , and eventually an output signal is produced . if everything went well that signal represents a correct prediction ! this is a helpful mental model , but computers are not biological brains . they do not have neurons , or synapses , or any of the other biological mechanisms that make brains work . because the biological model breaks down , researchers and scientists instead use graph theory to model neural networks \u2014 instead of describing neural networks as \u201cartificial brains\u201d , they describe them as complex graphs with powerful properties . viewed through the lens of graph theory a neural network is a series of layers of connected nodes each node represents a \u201cneuron\u201d and each connection represents a \u201csynapse\u201d . different kinds of nets have different kinds of connections . the simplest form of deep learning is a deep neural network . a deep neural network is a graph with a series of fully connected layers . every node in a particular layer has an edge to every node in the next layer each of these edges is given a different weight . the whole series of layers is the \u201cbrain\u201d . it turns out , if the weights on all these edges are set just right these graphs can do some incredible \u201cthinking\u201d . ultimately , the deep learning course will be about how to construct different versions of these graphs tune the connection weights until the system works and try to make sure our machine does what we think it\u2019s doing . the mechanics that make deep learning work , such as gradient descent and backpropagation , combine a lot of ideas from different mathematical disciplines . in order to really understand neural networks we need some math background . background knowledge \u2014 a little bit of everything given how easy to use libraries like pytorch and tensorflow are , it\u2019s really tempting to say , \u201cyou don\u2019t need the math that much . \u201d but after doing the required reading for the two classes , i\u2019m glad i have some previous math experience . a subset of topics from linear algebra , calculus , probability , statistics , and graph theory have already come up . getting this knowledge at university would entail taking roughly 5 courses . calculus 1 , 2 and 3 linear algebra and computer science 101 . luckily , you don\u2019t need each of those fields in their entirety . based on what i\u2019ve seen so far , this is what i would recommend studying if you want to get into neural networks yourself from linear algebra , you need to know the dot product , matrix multiplication ( especially the rules for multiplying matrices with different sizes ) , and transposes . you don\u2019t have to be able to do these things quickly by hand , but you should be comfortable enough to do small examples on a whiteboard or paper . you should also feel comfortable working with \u201cmultidimensional spaces\u201d \u2014 deep learning uses a lot of many dimensional vectors . i love 3blue1brown\u2019s essence of linear algebra for a refresher or an introduction into linear algebra . additionally , compute a few dot products and matrix multiplications by hand ( with small vector/matrix sizes ) . although we use graph theory to model neural networks these graphs are represented in the computer by matrices and vectors for efficiency reasons . you should be comfortable both thinking about and programming with vectors and matrices . from calculus you need to know the derivative , and you ideally should know it pretty well . neural networks involve simple derivatives , the chain rule , partial derivatives , and the gradient . the derivative is used by neural nets to solve optimization problems , so you should understand how the derivative can be used to find the \u201cdirection of greatest increase\u201d . a good intuition is probably enough , but if you solve a couple simple optimization problems using the derivative , you\u2019ll be happy you did . 3blue1brown also has an essence of calculus series , which is lovely as a more holistic review of calculus . gradient descent and backpropagation both make heavy use of derivatives to fine tune the networks during training . you don\u2019t have to know how to solve big complex derivatives with compounding chain and product rules , but having a feel for partial derivatives with simple equations helps a lot . from probability and statistics , you should know about common distributions , the idea of metrics , accuracy vs precision , and hypothesis testing . by far the most common applications of neural networks are to make predictions or judgements of some kind . is this a picture of a dog ? will it rain tomorrow ? should i show tyler this advertisement , or that one ? statistics and probability will help us assess the accuracy and usefulness of these systems . it\u2019s worth noting that the statistics appear more on the applied side the graph theory , calculus , and linear algebra all appear on the implementation side . i think it\u2019s best to understand both , but if you\u2019re only going to be using a library like tensorflow and are not interested in implementing these algorithms yourself \u2014 it might be wise to focus on the statistics more than the calculus & linear algebra . finally , the graph theory . honestly , if you can define the terms \u201cvertex\u201d , \u201cedge\u201d and \u201cedge weight\u201d you\u2019ve probably got enough graph theory under your belt . even this \u201cgentle introduction\u201d has more information than you need . in the next article in this series i\u2019ll be examining deep neural networks and how they are constructed . see you then ! part 2 deep neural networks as computational graphs part 3 classifying mnist digits with different neural network

It's important to understand the relationship between these fields, as it will help us comprehend the breadth of prerequisites and focus on the essential aspects of deep learning.\n\nDeep learning is a subset of ML, which in turn is a subset of AI. This means that all deep learning algorithms are ML algorithms, but not all ML algorithms employ deep learning techniques. To visualize this relationship, imagine a Venn diagram, where deep learning is represented as a circle fully encompassed by the larger circle of machine learning, which, in turn, is fully encompassed by the circle of artificial intelligence.\n\nDeep learning specifically refers to a class of algorithms called neural networks, with a particular emphasis on \"deep\" neural networks. It's worth noting that the concept of neural networks was first introduced in 1949, but their usefulness was limited at that time. From the 1970s to the 2010s, traditional AI methods consistently outperformed neural network models. These traditional AI methods included rule-based algorithms, heuristic-based approaches like A* search, constraint satisfaction algorithms such as arc consistency, tree search algorithms like minimal (used by the famous Deep Blue chess AI), and more.\n\nHowever, two significant obstacles hindered the success of machine learning, particularly deep learning: the availability of large datasets and computational power. In recent years, the advent of big data, with exabytes of available data, coupled with the accessibility of distributed supercomputers through cloud computing platforms like AWS, has revolutionized machine learning, especially deep learning.\n\nIt's important to recognize that there are other categories of machine learning, such as unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. However, in this article, we will primarily focus on supervised learning, which involves training algorithms to make predictions based on labeled data. Labeled data refers to data for which humans know the correct answers. For example, we could train an algorithm to predict mortgage defaults by providing it with datasets containing information about individuals who have and have not defaulted on their mortgages. By repeatedly making predictions and receiving corrections, the machine learning algorithm improves its prediction mechanism. This iterative process requires a significant amount of data to achieve optimal results.\n\nVarious machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, support vector machines, and decision trees, learn in different ways but follow the same fundamental process: making predictions, receiving corrections, and adjusting the prediction mechanism based on those corrections. This process is reminiscent of how humans learn.\n\nDeep learning, as a subset of machine learning, focuses on neural networks. Neural networks were originally inspired by the functioning of human brains, where individual neurons receive signals from other neurons and send signals to other neurons, with each neuron transforming the incoming signals in some way. Ultimately, the network produces an output signal, which ideally represents a correct prediction. Neural networks are aptly modeled using graph theory, with nodes representing neurons and connections representing synapses. In the computer implementation, the neural network is represented as a complex graph with powerful properties.\n\nA deep neural network, which represents the simplest form of deep learning, comprises a series of fully connected layers. Each layer's nodes are connected to every node in the next layer through weighted edges. This series of layers forms the \"brain\" of the network. By correctly setting these weight values, deep neural networks can perform remarkable computations and produce accurate predictions.\n\nTo fully comprehend the mechanics that drive deep learning, such as gradient descent and back propagation, it is necessary to have a solid foundation in mathematics. Several mathematical disciplines contribute to understanding neural networks, including linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, and graph theory.\n\nWhile modern libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow simplify the implementation of deep learning algorithms, it is still essential to have a decent grasp of relevant mathematical concepts. Although you may be tempted to believe that mathematics is not crucial, having prior knowledge in math will significantly benefit your deep learning journey.\n\nBased on the prerequisites observed thus far, a recommended study approach includes gaining familiarity with key topics in linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, and graph theory. While a comprehensive university-level curriculum could cover these subjects in approximately five courses (including calculus 1, 2, and 3, linear algebra, and computer science 101), it is not necessary to study them in their entirety for deep learning purposes.\n\nFor linear algebra, a solid understanding of the dot product, matrix multiplication (including rules for multiplying matrices with different sizes), and transposes is essential. You should also become comfortable working with multidimensional spaces, as deep learning heavily utilizes higher-dimensional vectors. Supplementary resources like 3blue1brown's \"Essence of Linear Algebra\" can provide a comprehensive refresher or introduction to this subject.\n\nIn calculus, a strong grasp of derivatives is crucial, as they play a significant role in neural network optimization through gradient descent and back propagation. You should understand simple derivatives, the chain rule, partial derivatives, and gradient concepts. 3blue1brown's \"Essence of Calculus\" series can help solidify your understanding of these topics.\n\nProbability and statistics knowledge is vital in assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of neural networks, as many applications involve predictions or judgments. It is valuable to comprehend common probability distributions, metrics, accuracy versus precision, and hypothesis testing. While statistics appears more on the applied side, graph theory, calculus, and linear algebra have more significance on the implementation side. Understanding both aspects is beneficial, although if you solely intend to use libraries like TensorFlow without implementing algorithms yourself, focusing more on statistics might be a reasonable approach.\n\nIn summary, deep learning introduces complex concepts and techniques that necessitate a foundation in mathematics. Although libraries simplify the implementation process, a grasp of linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, and graph theory greatly enhances your deep learning understanding and efficacy.\n\nIn the next article of this series, we will delve into deep neural networks and their construction. We hope you find this series valuable in your deep learning journey. END"}

tough question . the definition is pretty broad and there are several interpretations out there . not all of them are necessarily wrong , the valid question is which one is the most beneficial ? i use the following definition as i believe it always leads to cohesive components with tight coupling inside and loose coupling outside , which is exactly what we want the degree of cohesion of a component by a particular key equals the number of elements cohesive by the key within the component divided by the sum of the total number of elements cohesive by the key in the whole system and the number of elements not cohesive by the key inside the component . this long definition can be expressed as a simple formula the cohesion formula where c stands for the component , k stands for the key , and n stands for the number of elements . obviously , the maximal cohesion of a component is equal to one . this is what we strive for . i want to emphasize that cohesion doesn\u2019t depend on the number of connections between elements , that\u2019s what coupling is all about . cohesion is rather about belonging together . however , cohesive components do tend to have a higher degree of coupling within the component , but that\u2019s just a symptom of high cohesion , not the cause . the definition above might look complicated , but it\u2019s rather quite easy . let\u2019s illustrate it with some examples . we measure the degree of cohesion by the violet key for the components bordered with a dashed line in the following systems example measurements of cohesion functionality ( business ) is always the right key to use . violet and blue can stand for sales and accounting , a product and an invoice , or user registration and ordering . notice that my definition may be a bit oversimplified as the boundaries are not always as solid and obvious . this is why business experts must be involved . myth busted cohesion and coupling are almost always discussed together as they tightly correlate . the relation is sometimes a source of confusion as well , although its understanding is very useful to gain the most for the software system under development . a typical myth , i often hear people believe in , puts cohesion and coupling in opposition . practically , they say that \u201cthe higher cohesion the tighter coupling\u201d . i\u2019ll show you how wrong this statement is . this is usually illustrated with an example consider the highest possible cohesion of the system where every module is represented by a single line of code ( or a single function , an object with a single method , etc . ) . such a degree of cohesion will inevitably increase the coupling between modules to the maximum . as the conclusion is true , there is a small problem in the prerequisite . to find it out , we have to recall the definition of cohesion once again . it talks about belonging together , the strength of relationship of elements , and a common purpose . what does it mean in practice ? in fact , splitting elements that belong together makes cohesion actually lower . so , in the example above , the system really doesn\u2019t have the highest possible cohesion , in the opposite breaking modules into the smallest possible elements will separate related concepts and will lead to a pretty low cohesion . the moral here is cohesion is not something you can create automatically . cohesion is discovered in a particular context . that\u2019s why it is so hard for cohesion to be reliably measured . we will discuss this in detail later , stay tuned . cohesion and coupling let me show you some pictures . in each figure below , there are the very same elements with the very same dependencies . those are further differently organized . related domain concepts are represented with the same color low cohesion , tight coupling elements in the first picture have no explicit boundaries , it\u2019s an example of so-called coincidental cohesion . such architecture is known as the big ball of mud or the god object ( in oop code ) . high cohesion , tight coupling the second picture shows a system with three modules and a lot of dependencies between them . although the modules are highly cohesive , they are cohesive by the wrong key . this happens when code is organized by other than a domain relationship . a typical example is a logical organization of code in the layered architecture just image modules such as controllers , repositories , services , etc . have you seen these already somewhere ? hell yeah ! high cohesion , loose coupling the system in the third picture shows the ideal case correctly organized modules leading to high cohesion and loose coupling . the right key for organization is functionality , in other words , a business domain . the domain defines abstractions with a stable purpose the cohesion is driven upon . by the way , that\u2019s the main idea of the domain-driven design . focus on cohesion , not coupling we exhausted all variants except one a system with low cohesion and loose coupling . is it even possible to have such an architecture ? unfortunately , it is , and it\u2019s actually pretty common . systems with low cohesion and loose coupling are results of incorrect understanding of the domain and applying purely technical approaches to decouple the modules in an arbitrary way . interfaces everywhere with no abstraction representing a domain purpose are typical for systems built in this way . misuse of interfaces won\u2019t actually reduce coupling anyway , it just moves it into the runtime . striving for loose coupling at any cost can ( and will ) harm cohesion . as loose coupling is driven by high cohesion , we should strive for high cohesion in the first place . level of abstraction yes , high cohesion doesn\u2019t only make the system easy to understand and change , it also reduces the level of coupling . how is this even possible ? common sense says that the dependencies don\u2019t disappear simply by reorganizing elements . while this is true for the overall system dependencies , high cohesion does reduce dependencies on a higher level of abstraction . that is , although the absolute amount of dependencies remains the same , the coupling is tackled on different levels of abstraction . \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of the parts . \u201d ~ aristotle indeed , we can ignore the interdependencies inside modules getting so a simplified big picture with only three loosely coupled elements coupling on the higher level of abstraction is dramatically reduced neat . as we see , high cohesion actually results in loose coupling ! talk to me in code ! pictures are nice , but as software developers , we trust only code , don\u2019t we ?

In this post, I will delve into these concepts and discuss their significance in software engineering.\n\nCohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a module belong together. On the other hand, coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules. High cohesion and loose coupling are fundamental principles in software engineering, and they can be observed in various aspects, from code structure to team organization.\n\nThe importance of cohesion and coupling lies in their ability to reduce complexity, which is often the bane of software development. Unfortunately, these concepts are often considered too academic and poorly understood by many. So, let's start by clarifying what cohesion really means.\n\nThe definition of cohesion is quite broad and open to interpretation. While there are multiple definitions out there, the question is, which one is most beneficial? In my view, cohesion can be defined as the degree to which a component's elements that belong to a particular key are cohesive within the component, divided by the sum of the total number of elements that are cohesive by the key in the entire system and the number of elements that are not cohesive by the key within the component.\n\nThis definition can be expressed in a simple formula: cohesion = (number of elements cohesive by the key within the component) / (total number of elements cohesive by the key in the system + number of elements not cohesive by the key within the component). It's worth noting that the maximal cohesion of a component is one, which is what we strive for.\n\nIt's important to understand that cohesion is not dependent on the number of connections between elements; that's where coupling comes into play. Cohesion is about the elements belonging together, while coupling reflects the interdependencies between elements within a component. In cohesive components, there tends to be a higher degree of coupling, but this is merely a consequence of high cohesion, not the cause.\n\nWhile the above definition may seem complicated, it is actually quite straightforward. Let's illustrate it with some examples. For instance, in a system where functionality (business) is the right key to use, the degree of cohesion can be measured by the number of elements cohesive by that key within the component.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that boundaries are not always clear-cut and obvious. This is why involving business experts is crucial. Cohesion and coupling are often discussed together because of their correlation. However, it's essential to dispel a myth that puts cohesion and coupling in opposition. Some claim that \"the higher the cohesion, the tighter the coupling,\" but this statement is incorrect.\n\nTo demonstrate this, consider a system with modules represented by a single line of code or a single function. While this may seem to have the highest possible cohesion, it actually increases the coupling between modules to the maximum. The problem lies in the fact that cohesion is about elements belonging together, their relationships, and a common purpose. Consequently, splitting elements that belong together actually decreases cohesion.\n\nIn reality, cohesion is not something that can be automatically created; it is discovered within a specific context. This makes it challenging to reliably measure cohesion. Now, let's examine some pictures to further illustrate cohesion and coupling.\n\nIn each figure below, we have the same elements with the same dependencies, but they're organized differently. Low cohesion and tight coupling are exhibited in the first picture, where there are no explicit boundaries between elements. This example is known as coincidental cohesion or the big ball of mud.\n\nThe second picture shows a system with high cohesion but tight coupling by the wrong key. This often occurs when code is organized by factors other than the domain relationship, such as in the layered architecture. The third picture represents the ideal case: a system with high cohesion and loose coupling. Here, modules are correctly organized based on functionality, or the business domain.\n\nIt's important to remember that striving for loose coupling at any cost can harm cohesion. Loose coupling is driven by high cohesion, so it's crucial to prioritize and achieve high cohesion first. This leads us to the concept of the level of abstraction.\n\nHigh cohesion not only facilitates understanding and change in the system but also reduces coupling. This may seem counterintuitive as dependencies do not disappear merely by reorganizing elements. However, high cohesion tackles coupling on different levels of abstraction. Although the total number of dependencies remains the same, the coupling is effectively reduced at a higher level of abstraction.\n\nIndeed, as Aristotle said, \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\" Consequently, by ignoring the interdependencies within modules, we create a simplified big picture with only three loosely-coupled elements. This demonstrates how high cohesion actually results in loose coupling.\n\nWhile pictures are informative, as software developers, we rely on code. So, let's take a look at a simple class representing a bookstore:\n\n```\nclass Bookstore {  add(book) {...}\n  remove(book) {...}\n  sale(book) {...}\n  receptor(book) {...}\n}\n```\n\nThis class does everything, which indicates low cohesion and strong coupling between the clients and the class. However, we can improve this design by creating more cohesive classes. For instance, we can split the responsibilities into two classes:\n\n```\nclass Inventory {  add(book) {...}\n  remove(book) {...}\n}\n\nclass Sales {  sale(book) {...}\n  receptor(book) {...}\n}\n```\n\nBut should sales and accounting really be tightly related? Perhaps it would be better to create even more cohesive classes:\n\n```\nclass Sales {  sale(book) {...}\n}\n\nclass Accounting {  receptor(book) {...}\n}\n```\n\nHowever, what if our bookstore is a small family business where one clerk handles both sales and accounting on an old cash desk? In this case, we can't determine the right cohesion key unless we have a deep understanding of the domain. True cohesion is defined by the clients, and high cohesion is achieved when there is no way to further split the module while still satisfying the client's needs. This aligns with the single responsibility principle.\n\nIn conclusion, high cohesion and loose coupling are essential drivers in simple system architecture. They facilitate understanding, change, and maintenance. By reducing accidental complexity, these principles help create modules with well-defined boundaries. Coupling is about connections, while cohesion is about elements belonging together. Cohesion cannot be created automatically; it is discovered in a specific context. True cohesion is domain-driven. Importantly, high cohesion enables loose coupling, making it an invaluable design goal for software development. END"}

They are not easily comprehensible, as they involve concepts such as \"trustless,\" \"consensus,\" and \"incentive structure.\" Understanding these terms can be quite challenging.\n\nNevertheless, our society is undergoing a transformative phase. We are currently experiencing a reestablishment of trust and values. Initially, trust was established through non-verbal cues like facial expressions and body language, and eventually through spoken language. Over time, trust became \"institutionalized\" with the rise of centralized entities like Facebook, Google, and the Federal Reserve. This progression was a natural consequence of technological advancement. This new global trust model enabled individuals from all corners of the globe to communicate, exchange knowledge, participate in markets, and conduct business, as long as they trusted these centralized institutions to safeguard their data and finances.\n\nHowever, the situation is changing. A shift is underway, and we can perceive it if we pay attention. Public blockchain systems, starting with Bitcoin, employ our mutual interest in money to incentivize the immutability and finality of cryptographically secure data. This lies at the core of what is transpiring. This foundation provides an excellent platform for constructing new models of trust. The individuals pioneering in this field are diligently working to design, prototype, and establish businesses and industries that rely on an improved way of engaging in self-sovereign digital activities.\n\nWith these newly developed systems, the world is gradually realizing how to sustain participation in a global digital economy similar to what we are accustomed to, but without the conventional centralized institutions that we reluctantly rely on to power our digital lives and businesses. Like any significant movement, this transformation begins from the grassroots. These groundbreaking systems have held significance since the inception of their underlying ideas over a decade ago. However, their true significance will only be realized when integrating with them becomes the standard. At that point, questioning the alternative would seem preposterous. It's time for us, as individuals, businesses, communities, and as a species, to demand a better future for ourselves. Although we may be entrenched in our current ways, we are not obligated to remain here. Let us embark on this journey together, embracing the possibilities that lie ahead. END"}

All the colors were missing.\n\nAnd then there was me. After my initial pride in having completed a manuscript in record time, I was left to face the torment of my own doing. The disappointment came even before the rejection. I knew what I had created wasn't done with the passion, thoughtfulness, and technique that's required of effective storytelling. More than anything, that was the most difficult part to accept. That I could've done better.\n\nI let the thought of \"making it\" dictate my creative process. I saw an opportunity to prove that all these years of writing, all the rejection and disappointment, actually meant something. My ego needed to be satisfied. It was tired of feeling empty. I was tired of feeling invisible. Someone needed to tell me I was great. Even though this had nothing to do with me and everything to do with my writing, I didn't make that distinction. Who I am and the words I put together exist in concert. One can't be criticized without the other feeling its sting. That concept is another article in itself.\n\nWhat I should have reminded myself was that the work comes first. Before any acknowledgement, before any luck, before any peek at the kind of success I expect of myself, the work must be done. There is no skipping steps, no jumping ahead of the line if the work hasn't been properly prepared to match the opportunity. I learned that the hard way. When I tucked my ego back inside, I realized how much work had to be done. I needed to get better, to push myself to become a better writer, and that would take time and an investment into my education. With my ego no longer leading the way, those decisions became clear. The path wasn't paved with stone, but I could see the way.\n\nDespite all of this, I am thankful for the experience. It led me to a better understanding of what I am capable of as a writer. It also made me realize how important it is to take my time through the process. I'm not one of those writers who can bang out 50,000 words in a month and have it be any good, and that's okay. I know what it takes for me to be my best, and I'll keep doing that until I reach my goals. END"}
{"prompt": "6 pandas operations you should not miss advanced methods and function to crunch some data pandas is used mainly for reading , cleaning , and extracting insights from data . we will see an advanced use of pandas which are very important to a data scientist . these operations are used to analyze data and manipulate it if required . these are used in the steps performed before building any machine learning model . summarising data concatenation merge and join grouping pivot table reshaping multi-index dataframe we will be using the very famous titanic dataset to explore the functionalities of pandas . let\u2019s just quickly import numpy , pandas , and load titanic dataset from seaborn . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns df = sns . load_dataset ( ' titanic ' ) df . head ( ) summarizing data the very first thing any data scientist would like to know is the statistics of the entire data . with the help of the pandas . describe ( ) method , we can see the summary stats of each feature . notice , the stats are given only for numerical columns which is an obvious behavior we can also ask describe function to include categorical columns with the parameter \u2018include\u2019 and value equal to \u2018all\u2019 ( include=\u2018all\u2019 ) . df . describe ( ) another method is . info ( ) . it gives metadata of a dataset . we can see the size of the dataset , dtype , and count of null values in each column . df . info ( ) concatenation concatenation of two dataframes is very straightforward , thanks to the pandas method concat ( ) . let us take a small section of our titanic data with the help of vector indexing . vector indexing is a way to specify the row and column name/integer we would like to index in any order as a list . smalldata = df . loc[[1 , 7 , 21 , 10] , [ ' sex ' , ' age ' , ' fare ' , ' who ' , ' class ' ]] smalldata also , i have created a dataset with matching columns to explain concatenation . by default , the concatenation happens row-wise . let\u2019s see how the new dataset looks when we concat the two dataframes . pd . concat ( [smalldata , newdata] ) what if we want to concatenate ignoring the index ? just set the ingore_index parameter to true . pd . concat ( [ newdata , smalldata] , ignore_index=true ) if we wish to concatenate along with the columns we just have to change the axis parameter to 1 . pd . concat ( [ newdata , smalldata] , axis=1 ) left table-smalldata , right table-newdata notice the changes ? as soon we concatenated column-wise pandas arranged the data in an order of row indices . in smalldata , row 0 and 2 are missing but present in newdata hence insert them in sequential order . but we have row 1 in both the data and pandas retained the data of the 1st dataset because that was the 1st dataset we passed as a parameter to concat . also , the missing data is represented as nan . we can also perform concatenation in sql join fashion . let\u2019s create a new dataframe \u2018newdata\u2019 having a few columns the same as smalldata but not all . if you are familiar with sql join operation we can notice that . concat ( ) performs outer join by default . missing values for unmatched columns are filled with nan . pd . concat ( [smalldata , newdata] ) we can control the type of join operation with \u2018join\u2019 parameter . let\u2019s perform an inner join that takes only common columns from two . pd . concat ( [smalldata , newdata] , join= ' inner ' ) merge and join pandas provide us an exclusive and more efficient method . merge ( ) to perform in-memory join operations . merge method is a subset of relational algebra that comes under sql . i will be moving away from our titanic dataset only for this section to ease the understanding of join operation with less complex data . there are different types of join operations one-to-one many-to-one many-to-many the classic data used to explain joins in sql in the employee dataset . lets create dataframes . left table-df1 , right table-df2 one-to-one one-to-one merge is very similar to column-wise concatenation . to combine \u2018df1\u2019 and \u2018df2\u2019 we use . merge ( ) method . merge is capable of recognizing common columns in the datasets and uses it as a key , in our case column \u2018employee_name\u2019 . also , the names are not in order . let\u2019s see how the merge does the work for us by ignoring the indices . df3 = pd . merge ( df1 , df2 ) df3 many-to-one many-to-one is a type of join in which one of the two key columns have duplicate values . suppose we have supervisors for each department and there are many employees in each department hence , many employees to one supervisor . many-to-many this is the case where the key column in both the dataset has duplicate values . suppose many skills are mapped to each department then the resulting dataframe will have duplicate entries . merge on uncommon column names and values uncommon column names many times merging is not that simple since the data we receive will not be so clean . we saw how the merge does all the work provided we have one common column . what if we have no common columns at all ? or there is more than one common column . pandas provide us the flexibility to explicitly specify the columns to act as the key in both dataframes . suppose we change our \u2018employee_name\u2019 column to \u2018name\u2019 in \u2018df2\u2019 . let\u2019s see how datasets look and how to tell merge explicitly the key columns . parameter \u2018left_on\u2019 to specify the key of the first column and \u2018right_on\u2019 for the key of the second . remember , the value of \u2018left_on\u2019 should match with the columns of the first dataframe you passed and \u2018right_on\u2019 with second . notice , we get redundant column \u2018name\u2019 , we can drop it if not needed . uncommon values previously we saw that all the employee names present in one dataset were also present in other . what if the names are missing . by default merge applies inner join , meaning join in performed only on common values which is always not preferred way since there will be data loss . the method of joining can be controlled by using the parameter \u2018how\u2019 . we can perform left join or right join to overcome data loss . the missing values will be represented as nan by pandas . print ( ' -------left join-------- ' , pd . merge ( df1 , df2 , how= ' left ' ) ) print ( ' -------right join-------- ' , pd . merge ( df1 , df2 , how= ' right ' ) ) groupby groupby is a very flexible abstraction , we can think of it as a collection of dataframe . it allows us to do many different powerful operations . in simple words , it groups the entire data set by the values of the column we specify and allows us to perform operations to extract insights . let\u2019s come back to our titanic dataset suppose we would like to see how many male and female passengers survived . print ( df . groupby ( ' sex ' ) ) df . groupby ( ' sex ' ) . sum ( ) notice , printing only the groupby without performing any operation gives groupby object . since there are only two unique values in the column \u2018sex\u2019 we can see a summation of every other column grouped by male and female . more insightful would be to get the percentage . we will capture only the \u2018survived\u2019 column of groupby result above upon summation and calculate percentages . data = df . groupby ( ' sex ' ) [ ' survived ' ] . sum ( ) print ( ' % of male survivers ' , ( data[ ' male ' ]/ ( data[ ' male ' ]+data[ ' female ' ] ) ) *100 ) print ( ' % of male female ' , ( data[ ' female ' ]/ ( data[ ' male ' ]+data[ ' female ' ] ) ) *100 ) output % of male survivers 31 . 87134502923976 % of male female 68 . 12865497076024 under the hood , the groupby function performs three operations split-apply-combine . split - breaking the dataframe in order to group it into the specified key . apply - it involves computing the function we wish like aggregation or transformation or filter . combine - merging the output into a single dataframe . courtesy-python data science handbook by jake vanderplas perhaps , more powerful operations that can be performed on groupby are aggregate filter transform apply let\u2019s see each one with an example . aggregate the aggregate function allows us to perform more than one aggregation at a time . we need to pass the list of required aggregates as a parameter to . aggregate ( ) function . df . groupby ( ' sex ' ) [ ' survived ' ] . aggregate ( [ ' sum ' , np . mean , ' median ' ] ) filter the filter function allows us to drop data based on group property . suppose we want to see data where the standard deviation of \u2018fare\u2019 is greater than the threshold value say 50 when grouped by \u2018survived\u2019 . df . groupby ( ' survived ' ) . filter ( lambda x x[ ' fare ' ] . std ( ) > 50 ) since the standard deviation of \u2018fare\u2019 is greater than 50 only for values of \u2018survived\u2019 equal to 1 , we can see data only where \u2018survived\u2019 is 1 . transform transform returns the transformed version of the entire data . the best example to explain is to center the dataset . centering the data is nothing but subtracting each value of the column with the mean value of its respective column . df . groupby ( ' survived ' ) . transform ( lambda x x - x . mean ( ) ) apply apply is very flexible unlike filter and transform , the only criteria are it takes a dataframe and returns pandas object or scalar . we have the flexibility to do anything we wish in the function . def func ( x ) x[ ' fare ' ] = x[ ' fare ' ] / x[ ' fare ' ] . sum ( ) return x df . groupby ( ' survived ' ) . apply ( func ) pivot tables previously in groupby , we saw how \u2018sex\u2019 affected survival , the survival rate of females is much larger than males . suppose we would also like to see how \u2018pclass\u2019 affected the survival but both \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018pclass\u2019 side by side . using groupby we would do something like this . df . groupby ( [ ' sex ' , ' pclass ' ][ ' survived ' ] . aggregate ( ' mean ' ) . unstack ( ) this is more insightful , we can easily make out passengers in the third class section of the titanic are less likely to be survived . this type of operation is very common in the analysis . hence , pandas provides the function . pivot_table ( ) which performs the same with more flexibility and less complexity . df . pivot_table ( ' survived ' , index= ' sex ' , columns= ' pclass ' ) the result of the pivot table function is a dataframe , unlike groupby which returned a groupby object . we can perform all the dataframe operations normally on it . we can also add a third dimension to our result . suppose we want to see how \u2018age\u2019 has also affected the survival rate along with \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018pclass\u2019 . let\u2019s divide our \u2018age\u2019 into groups within it 0\u201318 child/teenager , 18\u201340 adult , and 41\u201380 old . age = pd . cut ( df[ ' age ' ] , [0 , 18 , 40 , 80] ) pivottable = df . pivot_table ( ' survived ' , [ ' sex ' , age] , ' class ' ) pivottable interestingly female children and teenagers in the second class have a 100% survival rate . this is the kind of power the pivot table of pandas has . reshaping multi-index dataframe to see a multi-index dataframe from a different view we reshape it . stack and unstack are the two methods to accomplish this . unstack ( ) it is the process of converting the row index to the column index . the pivot table we created previously is multi-indexed row-wise . we can get the innermost row index ( age groups ) into the innermost column index . pivottable = pivottable . unstack ( ) pivottable we can also convert the outermost row index ( sex ) into the innermost column index by using parameter \u2018level\u2019 . pivottable = pivottable . unstack ( level=0 ) piviottable stack ( ) stacking is exactly inverse of unstacking . we can convert the column index of multi-index dataframe into a row index . the innermost column index \u2018sex\u2019 is converted to the innermost row index . the result is slightly different from the original dataframe because we unstacked with level 0 previously .","completion": " 6 Essential Pandas Operations for Data Analysis\n\nPandas is a powerful library used for reading, cleaning, and extracting insights from data. As a data scientist, it is important to have a good grasp of advanced Pandas operations that can help in data analysis and manipulation. These operations are usually performed before building machine learning models. Let's explore these operations using the famous Titanic dataset.\n\n1. Summarizing Data:\nThe first step in data analysis is to understand the statistics of the dataset. Panda provides the `describe()` method that gives a summary of the numerical columns. To include categorical columns, you can use the `include='all'` parameter with the `describe()` function. Additionally, the `info()` method provides metadata about the dataset, including the size, type, and count of null values in each column.\n\n2. Concatenation:\nConcatenating two data frames in Pandas is straightforward using the `conceit()` method. By default, concatenation happens row-wise. You can also concatenate columns by changing the `axis` parameter to 1. If you want to ignore the index while concatenating, you can set the `ignore_index` parameter to true. Pandas also allows concatenation in a SQL join fashion, performing outer joins by default. You can control the type of join operation using the `join` parameter.\n\n3. Merge and Join:\nPandas provides the `merge()` method to perform in-memory join operations. The `merge()` method is a subset of relational algebra that comes under SQL. You can perform different types of join operations, including one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many. You can also specify the key columns explicitly using the `left_on` and `right_on` parameters. Panda allows you to handle uncommon column names and values during merging.\n\n4. Group by:\nThe `group by()` function is a powerful abstraction that allows you to group the data based on specific columns and perform operations to extract insights. For example, you can group the Titanic dataset by the 'sex' column and calculate the number of male and female passengers who survived. The `group by()` function performs split-apply-combine operations, splitting the data frame, applying the specified function, and combining the results into a single data frame.\n\n5. Pivot Tables:\nPivot tables are a common data analysis operation that allows you to analyze the relationship between multiple variables. Panda provides the `pivot_table()` function to create pivot tables with flexibility and simplicity. You can specify index and column values to analyze the relationship between different variables. The result is a data frame that can be further analyzed or visualized.\n\n6. Reshaping Multi-Index Data frame:\nSometimes, you may need to reshape a multi-index data frame for a different view. Panda provides the `stack()` and `unstuck()` methods to accomplish this. `unstuck()` converts the row index into column index, while `stack()` converts the column index into a row index.\n\nBy mastering these essential Pandas operations, you will be well-equipped to analyze and manipulate data effectively.

{"prompt": "possibilities / entrepreneurship i published six articles on vocal this is what i learned . introduction i published a story about my initial experience of vocal . the readers well received the story on my experimentation . more importantly , the responses motivated me to write a follow up on my findings . my purpose was to introduce my findings and initial impression on vocal+ . i mentioned the basics and provided adequate information to get you started writing for vocal . many writers found vocal useful as a freelance opportunity . several writers enhanced my messages . from your comments , i learned about new features . thank you all for your excellent input . through this initiative , i met new writers and started collaborating . one simple story can open new communication path . i am grateful for the outcome . purpose of this post in this post , i will share my findings based on six articles i submitted to vocal . here are the links to my six articles for two reasons a ) to show you type of articles for vocal b ) to indicate the communities and topics . i highlighted the communities in bold format . you can find the topics when you click on each link . some topics nicely surprised me as i did not know their existence on vocal . i deliberately selected these six articles representing different topics and audience for my experimentation . i am still experimenting to discover new features . i will continue to record my observations and share with you in another post . you can find my observations in the following sections . i created subheadings to make it easy to read and understand . power of vocal communities one of the key findings is the power of communities on vocal . i am discovering new communities with each submission . in the last three submissions , i found blush , 01 , and motivation communities . even though there is no follow feature for writer profiles , it is easy to find the contributors . each contributor has a profile . the profile includes a list of stories . the stories give a hint about the communities the writers follow . they are highlighted in various colors . i came across several medium writers publishing stories on vocal . it was a pleasure to notice familiar faces especially contributors to my publication . challenges and nominations on vocal i discovered a new feature that you can nominate your stories to competitive challenges . the latest competition is called \u201cthe perfect pairing\u201d . your nominated story has a chance to win a prize . how cool is this ! here is some information about this specific competition which i extracted for you from vocal site first place $2 , 500 + $100 gift card second place $1 , 000 + $100 gift card third place $500 + $100 gift card indication to views and reads on vocal my six stories received reasonably good views . when i say reasonable , it means that the number of views for my stories exceeded my expectations to give you an idea , my stories on vocal received at least 20 times more views than what they did on medium in my first week . to put this into perspective , it took me six months to get reasonable views on medium , but it took only one week on vocal . so , it looks promising . the main reason for this 20 times more views is leveraging my medium experience . i had no idea when i joined to medium . i was in the total dark and felt lonely . whereas , with vocal , i knew how to promote my content . it is not the platform only , but my informed approach to content marketing helped me gain 20 times more views on vocal in my first week . this approach indicates that success for writers depends on taking personal responsibility for marketing . unless you meaningfully engage and promote your content , the platforms , whatever their sizes are , would not make a real impact on the outcome . self-publishing versus moderated publishing it is a great benefit to self-publish our stories . i found this feature useful on medium . we cannot self-publish on vocal . but it is not a big deal . in fact , it served as a blessing in disguise for me . when we submit our stories , they are reviewed by moderators and published in relevant communities and topics . even though i was initially concerned for not being able to self-publish , moderated publishing brought a new advantage to me . let me explain . there are many communities on vocal . i couldn\u2019t find any description of those communities , and some names are not even descriptive . for example , i did not know what community 01 mean until i saw my cybersecurity story on this community . however , moderators found the right community and the topic fitting the purpose of my content . with the help of moderators , my six stories were published in different communities . i discovered the topics of specific communities . learning about a topics is an advantage because when i click on the link for each topic , i can find the writers who write about a specific topic . my initial frustration and confusion turned into joy by discovering new topics and writers . maybe vocal created this ambiguity on purpose . sometimes mystery can be a good thing . i can see some psychological benefits from my experience . earning and compensation i shared the earning scheme in my previous post . vocal pays based on views . but in reality , they mean actual reading time for your story . just clicking on a story and scrolling it would not register as views . there are two streams for each based on membership levels . for the free account , they pay $3 . 80 per 1000 reads . for the paid version ( vocal+ ) , they pay $6 . 00 per 1000 reads . the paid account ( vocal+ ) subscription price is usd 9 . 99 . there are some additional benefits for vocal+ membership mentioned on their website . i mentioned the creative tips feature in my previous story . readers can give tips using their credit card , which can be paid to the writers via their stripe accounts . tips range between $1 and $20 . since the last post , i found out that there was a minimum payout notice non-member \u2014 $35 and vocal+ member \u2014 $20 . my understanding is that you cannot withdraw under $20 tips if you are a vocal+ . there is also a small fee deducted by vocal for earning from tips . as earning money is not the primary motivation for me , i prefer not to focus on it and not go into details . the income for my level of writing is negligible both on medium and vocal hence not worth fussing about it . however , to give you an indication of earning from vocal stories , 40 views equated to around 20 cents per the stats of my stories in the vocal dashboard . you can make comparative calculations based on this indicative figure . major benefits for me my key focus on writing in content platforms , including medium and vocal , is to enhance my network by meeting new writers , readers , and collaborators . medium helped me meet thousands of new writers , readers , and collaborators . i am grateful . i started experiencing a similar effect with vocal . with my engagement on vocal in a week , i noticed some improved traffic to my content on my websites . the number of views of my blogs increased by at least 10% . i believe readers from vocal communities are discovering my content , exploring my profile , and subscribing to my blogs . this is one of the essential benefits and desired by-product of publishing on vocal . you may find other reasons to publish on vocal . anecdotes and validation there are always good and bad comments about any platform on social media . it is inevitable . based on my experience with social media , i take reader comments with a pinch of salt as there may be different motives that we may not know . i read some negative and discouraging comments about vocal on social media . however , most of them turned out to be noise . when i fact-checked those statements , i found out that some people just make arbitrary claims with no evidence . for example , some writers were trying to judge the platform with only one story they submitted and did not perform . some made comments that it was a scam with allegations such as they don\u2019t pay earning to the writers . however , i noticed that one of the engaging medium writers , aamir kamal \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 debunked most of the claims by providing his personal earning history publicly . aamir also interviewed one of the high earning members on youtube . i noticed that the high earner is a founding member . i don\u2019t know yet what a founding member means . i will update you when i discover this membership type . will i continue publishing on vocal ? several writers asked me on whether i would continue for submitting content to vocal . based on my current findings , the answer is yes . the main reason is i had immediate benefits for publishing six stories on vocal . my experimentation proved it . i want to continue experimenting and discovering opportunities . should you write for vocal ? another frequently asked question from writers is \u201cshould we create an account and write for vocal ? \u201d . this is entirely up to you . i don\u2019t endorse any writing platform , tools , or services . however , if i were you , i would give it a go . let me share my reasons for the encouragement briefly with an example . a year ago , i did not know anything about medium . in such a short time , i gained thousands of followers , met amazing people across the globe , created significant publications followed by 45k readers and contributed by 5 . 6k writers . this all happened with an open mind and by giving it a go despite the initial ambiguity on medium . yes , in the first six months , exposure to my content was extremely slow on medium , but once my content and profile were discovered in the second six month , the exposure was exponential . the reason i share my medium experience is the same potential for vocal . since there are many communities on vocal , who knows your profile and content can be discovered by some communities , and you may gain substantial exposure to a new audience . vocal offers a free account . it is risk-free . you have nothing to lose . if you see some benefits , you can upgrade it to vocal+ . the best thing is that you can cancel it anytime . they even provide a one-month free membership for vocal+ . why not try and see ? simply put , if you don\u2019t buy a lotto ticket , you will never have a chance to win . re-purposing content one of the benefits of writing for another platform is re-purposing your content . this is a critical content marketing strategy . i have been successfully re-purposing my content for three decades . content management experts such as jeff herring , tim maudlin , and maryjo wagner , phd are big on this topic . content re-purposing provided me many benefits . for example , i published academic papers in peer-reviewed journals for a narrow audience . however , converting the content to public language , and publishing them in popular platforms , my content gained a new audience , in fact , a bigger one . i use the same approach for my medium content . for example , i re-write some of my medium stories appealing to a specific community on vocal . as long as you provide a disclaimer for your content indicating the original content belongs to you , vocal allows you to publish your previously published material . ability to publish your prior content is an excellent opportunity for content re-purposing . this is a substantial premise for freelancers . i can now answer the question on whether you can publish your previously published stories on vocal . the answer is yes , based on my recent finding . all you need to do is to provide a disclaimer with a link so that moderators don\u2019t have to waste their time to validate the copyright ownership . conclusion in this story , i shared my recent experience in a new content development and publishing platform called vocal . as i mentioned in my previous article , the learning curve for vocal was gentle for me . i became self-sufficient in a week . i gained noticeable benefits by publishing for vocal . publishing as few as six articles brought immediate benefits . the biggest gain was visibility to my blogger profile and content on multiple platforms . yes , there will always be negative comments or hypes about any platform . we have the power to filter these extreme viewpoints by applying logic and by low-risk trial and errors . it can be useful to give a try to a new platform . we never know unless we try it . keeping an open mind is a sign of growth mindset . you have nothing to lose but a lot to gain with a growth mindset . i wish you all the best in your writing career . if you want to collaborate for success on vocal , please join my quora space specifically designed for vocal writers and stories . i will help you succeed . you can find my vocal profile from this link . thank you for reading my perspective .","completion": " Possibilities of Entrepreneurship: Insights from Six Articles on Vocal\n\nIntroduction:\nI recently published a story about my initial experience with Vocal, and I am pleased to share that it was well-received by readers. The positive feedback and engagement I received from that story motivated me to write a follow-up on my findings. In this article, I aim to share my learnings and initial impressions of Vocal+, as well as introduce the basics and provide useful information for those interested in writing for the platform.\n\nThe Value of Vocal Communities:\nOne of the key findings I discovered through my submissions to Vocal is the power of its communities. With each submission, I had the opportunity to explore and engage with new communities. In my last few submissions, I came across communities such as Blush, 01, and Motivation. While there isn't a direct follow feature for writer profiles, it is relatively easy to find and connect with contributors on Vocal. Each contributor has a profile that includes a list of their stories, offering insights into the communities they follow. This feature proved to be a valuable tool for networking and collaboration.\n\nChallenges and Nominations on Vocal:\nI also stumbled upon an interesting feature on Vocal, which allows you to nominate your stories for competitive challenges. The latest challenge titled \"The Perfect Pairing\" offers nominated stories a chance to win prizes. This adds a layer of excitement and incentive for writers on the platform.\n\nIndication of Views and Reads on Vocal:\nWhen it comes to views and reads, my articles on Vocal received remarkably more attention compared to those on Medium. In just the first week, my Vocal stories garnered at least 20 times more views than their Medium counterparts. This promising outcome can be attributed to my ability to leverage my experience on Medium and apply effective content marketing strategies to promote my work on Vocal. It serves as a reminder that achieving success as a writer depends on actively engaging with and promoting your content, regardless of the platform.\n\nSelf-Publishing versus Moderated Publishing:\nWhile Vocal does not offer self-publishing capabilities like Medium, I found that moderated publishing on Vocal had its advantages. When you submit a story to Vocal, it goes through a review process by moderators who then publish it in relevant communities and topics. Initially, I was concerned about not being able to self-publish, but this process actually turned into a blessing in disguise. It allowed my stories to be showcased in various communities that aligned with their content and purpose. This, in turn, led me to discover new topics and writers, turning my frustration into joy.\n\nEarning and Compensation on Vocal:\nI previously shared the earning scheme on Vocal, which is based on views or, more specifically, actual reading time for your stories. Vocal pays writers based on membership levels, with the free account receiving $3.80 per 1000 reads and the paid version (Vocal+) earning $6.00 per 1000 reads. Vocal+ offers additional benefits, including the ability for readers to give tips to writers using their credit cards. However, given the negligible income I have personally earned from my writing, I prefer not to focus on it extensively. Success as a writer relies on factors beyond mere monetary compensation.\n\nMajor Benefits and Validation:\nThe key focus of my writing on content platforms like Medium and Vocal is to enhance my network by connecting with new writers, readers, and collaborators. Both these platforms have allowed me to achieve this aim. I have noticed an increase in traffic to my external blogs since engaging with Vocal, indicating that readers from Vocal communities are discovering my content, exploring my profile, and subscribing to my blogs.

It offers advantages over traditional cumulative comparison methods as it allows us to determine the percentage by which one option is better than another, considering the relevance of each variable involved. The detailed theory behind this method was explained in a previous article in this series (image by thinkersnewsng).\n\nNow, let's explore an interesting application of pairwise ranking: predicting the final standings of the English Premier League for the current season (2020-21). In this case, we will use head-to-head results from the last 5 matches as the parameter to rank teams. It's fascinating to see how closely the predictions align with the actual table standings when applied to the 2019-20 season for validation.\n\nTo begin, we need to ensure that our data is prepared properly. There are various reliable sources available, and I have collected match results from football.com dating back to the 2004 season. I've compiled this data into a single file that you can access in the accompanying repository.\n\nLet's load the data and proceed with the analysis using the following libraries: Rio, duly, boost, and knit. After loading the data, we need to format the necessary columns as dates. The dataset contains head-to-head results from the 2004 season, with ratings assigned according to the previously described method. \n\nAt the start of each season, the available head-to-head data consists of the results from the previous seasons. Therefore, for every season (n), the team rankings will be based on the final table standings in season (n+1). For example, if Chelsea finished 3rd at the end of the 2018-19 season, with a 9-point lead over Manchester City and a 6-point lead over Liverpool, their head-to-head results against all teams at the end of the 2018-19 season would be used to predict their ranking in the 2019-20 season.\n\nNext, we divide the data into train and test sets. Considering the shift in the English Premier League after the 2012-13 season, where all teams became highly competitive, we can select the training data from the 2013-14 season to the 2018-19 season. The model we create will be tested against the 2019-20 season, which can be considered an outlier due to various factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Liverpool winning the title.\n\nAfter splitting the data, we create the training and testing data sets for the specific teams we are interested in, such as Arsenal and Wolves. We also define the target variable as the rank of each team. \n\nNext, we set a seed (1000) for reproducibility and create train and subtest objects using the boost library. We do not perform any additional parameter tuning, except for setting the number of trees (stress) to 5000 and the early stopping round to 20. The metric we use to evaluate the model is NDC (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) as described in the tutorial.\n\nWe train the model using the training data and evaluate it on the test data for the 2019-20 season. The model predicts the rankings of the teams, and the results are stored in the 'red' variable. These predictions are then added to the test dataset for analysis.\n\nThe model successfully predicts the title winner and runner-up. It is interesting to note that the training data does not include Liverpool achieving rank 1, but the model is able to pick up on their overall improvement in head-to-head results, resulting in an accurate prediction. Tottenham, which finished 6th in the actual standings, is ranked 3rd by the model. This discrepancy can be attributed to the team coming off a successful season and is considered an outlier.\n\nWith a focus on the top rankings, the model accurately predicts Manchester United and Chelsea in the next positions. However, due to limited data availability, the model doesn't perform well for Wolves, and 4 out of the bottom 5 teams accurately predicted their relegation battle outcome.\n\nConsidering the accuracy of predictions for the previous season, we move on to predicting the standings for the 2020-21 season. We load the prediction data for this season and select the relevant teams, excluding those that were recently promoted (Norwich, Sheffield United, Aston Villa). Using these teams, we input the data into the model and generate predictions for this season.\n\nThe predictions for the 2020-21 season indicate that Chelsea is predicted to win the league, followed by Liverpool, Manchester United, and Manchester City. Although it might be hard for football enthusiasts to digest the possibility of Manchester City finishing in 4th place and neither City nor Liverpool winning the league, the numbers suggest otherwise. We should remain open-minded, fingers crossed, as surprises are always possible.\n\nIn terms of the relegation battle, the model predicts that Fulham, West From, Crystal Palace, and Aston Villa are the most likely teams to be involved. Notably, 3 out of these 4 teams were promoted in the last two seasons.\n\nIt's important to note that there may be biases in the predictions, given that the parameter considered is the head-to-head results from only the last two seasons. This approach does not take into account factors like team changes due to transfers. The model also gave more weight to accurately predicting the top rankings over the bottom ones. Additionally, teams new to the English Premier League, like Leeds, do not have sufficient historical data in terms of head-to-head results.\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated an interesting application of pairwise ranking by predicting the final standings of the English Premier League. Keep in mind that there are multiple packages available, besides boost, that you can explore if interested. For a deeper understanding of the theory behind pairwise ranking, I recommend reading the accompanying article. END"}

If you haven't read the previous parts, here are the prerequisite sections for this blog post, as well as the subsequent parts of this series:\n\nPre-requisite:\n\nTo better understand the concepts discussed in this post, it is important to have knowledge of matrix convolution. I have briefly explained this in the first section of part one of this series. Additionally, knowing about the Rectifier Linear Unit (Rely) activation function could help you grasp some points mentioned in section 2.\n\nVisualizing 3D Filters:\n\nFor those who find it helpful, you can think of the 3D filters I will discuss later in this post as Rubik's cubes.\n\nColor Images and 3D Convolutions:\n\nIn the previous parts, we focused on grayscale images (black and white). But what if the input images have color? It turns out that we need to consider 3D convolutions instead of 2D convolutions.\n\nFascinating Fact:\n\nDid you know that the high-quality images we see on our smartphones are made possible by the use of Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays? These displays consist of a grid of individually controlled dimmable red, green, and blue subpixels. It's amazing to think that there are over 10 million of these lights on our phones!\n\n1. Convolutions Over Volume\n\n1.1 Convolutions on RGB Images:\n\nFigure 1 illustrates coevolving a 6 by 6 by 3 volume with a 3D filter (a 3 by 3 by 3 filter). An RGB image is represented as a 6 by 6 by 3 volume, where the 3 corresponds to the three color channels (RGB).\n\nTo detect edges or other features in this image, you can coevolve the 6 by 6 by 3 volume with a 3D filter, as shown in Figure 1. It's important to note that the filter has 3 layers corresponding to the red, green, and blue channels. The height of the image is denoted by the first 6, the width by the second 6, and 3 represents the number of channels. Similarly, the filter has a height, width, and number of channels.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential for the number of channels in the image to match the number of channels in the filter (as depicted by the curved line connecting the last numbers in Figure 1). Additionally, observe that the output image is a 4 by 4 image (or 4 by 4 by 1 image) instead of a 4 by 4 by 3 image. This will become clearer when we explore multiple filters in section 1.2.\n\nFigure 2 provides a representation of a 3D convolution. It shows a 6 by 6 by 3 image and a 3 by 3 by 3 filter. Notice that the 3 by 3 by 3 filter has 27 numbers or parameters, which can be visualized as three cubes.\n\nStay tuned for the next part of this series, where we'll delve into further details on convolutions.

It allows you to interact with core resources such as datasets, views, jobs, and routines. Currently, there are seven client libraries available: C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. In this article, we will focus on using the Python client library for the BigQuery API on a personal computer. Please make sure you have Python already installed before proceeding. As a recommendation, you can install Visual Studio Code and access the terminal, as we will be using it for all the examples.\n\nTo get started, you need to install the BigQuery client library. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery\n```\n\nNext, we need to set up authentication to access the BigQuery service. To do this, you need to create a service account and set an environment variable. A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console and navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.\n2. Click on \"+ Create Credentials\" and select \"Service Account\".\n3. Follow the prompts to create a service account.\n4. After the service account is created, a .Jason key file will be automatically downloaded. Please keep this file safe, as it grants access to your BigQuery resources.\n5.

To work with the query result in a pandas Database, we will also need to install the following libraries:\n\n```\npip install pandas\npip install yarrow\npip install google-cloud-bigquery-storage\n```\n\nNow let's move on to the other APIs available for BigQuery:\n\n2. BigQuery Data Transfer API: This API is used for ingestion workflows. If you want to include periodic ingestion from Google Cloud Storage or get analytics data from other Google services like Search Ads 360, Campaign Manager, YouTube, or third-party services like Amazon S3, Teradata, or Amazon Redshift.\n\nTo install the library for the BigQuery Data Transfer API, run the following command:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery-datatransfer\n```\n\n3. BigQuery Storage API: This API exposes high throughput data reading for consumers who need to scan large volumes of managed data from their own applications and tools. To install the client library for the BigQuery Storage API, run the following command:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery-storage\n```\n\n4. BigQuery Connection API: This API allows establishing a remote connection to allow BigQuery to interact with remote data sources like Cloud SQL. This means BigQuery is enabled to query data residing in Cloud SQL without moving the data. To install the client library for the BigQuery Connection API, run the following command:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery-connection\n```\n\nAlso, make sure to enable the BigQuery Connection API in the Cloud Console.\n\n5.

A solid morning routine is the foundation of a productive day. As Richard Whiteley once wisely said, \"Lose an hour in the morning, and you will spend all day looking for it.\" The best morning habits put you in the perfect mindset to accomplish your tasks efficiently.\n\nHighly productive people carefully choose how to focus their mornings. They engage in activities such as morning exercise to increase blood flow and improve mental clarity, meditation, writing down thoughts, reading a book, listening to a favorite podcast, learning something new, jotting down ideas, engaging in creative work, or completing their most important task. They may even dedicate time to work on side hustles or pursue a hobby. There are countless productive things you can do to start your day right. The key is to incorporate habits that align with your personal needs and goals.\n\nWhile good habits can set you up for a productive morning, some morning activities can hinder productivity and negatively impact your mood, potentially derailing the rest of your day. Just as how you spend your last few hours before bed can impact your sleep, how you spend your first few hours in the morning is equally important.\n\nHere are five things highly productive people never do in the morning:\n\n1. They don't forget to hydrate first thing in the morning: Staying hydrated is essential for overall brain and body health. Dehydration can leave you feeling tired in the morning. Productive individuals make it a point to drink at least a glass of water first thing in the morning. Hydration after waking up provides incredible energy and prepares the body for the day ahead.\n\n2. They don't immediately drink coffee: While there is nothing wrong with enjoying a morning cup of coffee, drinking water before consuming caffeine can be more beneficial in the long run. Most people reach for coffee immediately after waking up, but this habit can interfere with your body's natural wake-up process. Drinking coffee at peak cortisol times diminishes the energy-boosting effects of caffeine and can lead to a tolerance build-up over time. Prioritizing water first thing in the morning allows for better digestion when you have breakfast. Humans run off water, not caffeine.\n\n3. They don't choose breakfast options without protein and fiber: Opting for a low-fiber and low-protein breakfast, or a high-sugar breakfast, can lead to a poor experience later in the day. Foods with high fiber and protein, such as hot oatmeal, multi-grain cereal, eggs, nuts, and berries, provide sustainable energy and prevent blood sugar spikes and crashes. Consuming healthy fats and proteins sets the stage for a productive and focused day.\n\n4. They don't make too many decisions in the morning: Highly effective and productive people avoid spending the first hours of their morning making decisions. Making too many decisions early on depletes your energy quickly. Instead, focus on activities that bring out the best in you and help you accomplish your goals. If you need to read a book in the morning, choose it the night before. Want to tackle a specific task? Decide on it in advance and dive right into it in the morning. Avoid getting caught up in trivial decision-making while your brain is still fresh.\n\n5. They don't plan their day in the morning: Starting your day on purpose and planning well in advance allows you to accomplish a lot more. Successful individuals often spend their evenings preparing for the next morning, freeing up their mornings for important tasks. Planning the night before is effective because we have a limited amount of willpower and decision-making ability daily. Making too many decisions in the morning can slow you down and drain your mental resources throughout the day. Creating a schedule and setting priorities the night before allows you to wake up with an actionable plan, making it easier to stay focused.\n\nIncorporating these practices into your morning routine can help you become more productive and set the tone for a successful day. Remember, the key is to align your habits with your personal goals and needs. By avoiding these common morning pitfalls and implementing productive habits, you can maximize your efficiency and achieve more consistent energy and performance throughout the day. END"}

Often, pride inhibits us from admitting our need for support. To overcome this, my first and foremost advice is to seek help. Fortunately, there are numerous avenues available, such as participating in online or in-person counseling sessions, reaching out to a trusted friend, spouse, mentor, or even a spiritual advisor. By seeking assistance, we not only acknowledge our need for help but also make progress towards our own healing, which releases dopamine. Moreover, seeking help brings outside wisdom and accountability, enriching our personal growth.\n\nSetting small fitness goals can significantly contribute to our mental well-being. Engaging in a lifestyle centered around healthy habits minimizes the likelihood of facing depression. Additionally, establishing goals enables us to cultivate positive habits, resulting in happiness, fulfillment, and the release of dopamine. Therefore, incorporating activities like walking, running, or performing simple exercises, such as sit-ups, into our daily routine, even at a slow pace, will contribute to our overall well-being.\n\nAnother important aspect to address is our diet. Fueling our bodies with nutritious food is essential for breaking the cycle of depression. Making a conscientious agreement with ourselves to make small dietary changes, such as dedicating Tuesdays to abstain from consuming sugar or ensuring we drink three liters of water at least three days a week, is a tangible goal. By defining realistic and achievable goals, we can gain direct and indirect benefits that positively impact our mental health.\n\nWhile current circumstances make physical connection challenging, joining a community and actively socializing remains crucial. Whether it be through churches, small interest groups, meetups, or mentorship meetings, engaging with others in a social setting contributes significantly to our well-being. As social animals, genuine human interaction is vital for our overall happiness and contentment.\n\nStriving to assist others, even during our own healing journey, holds tremendous power. By helping others, we gain a fresh perspective and shift our mindset, leading to inner transformation. Engaging in activities like teaching a course for free, mentoring junior developers, or offering Q&A sessions to individuals aspiring to join our profession can bring about profound changes within ourselves. As Mahatma Gandhi beautifully expressed, \"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\"\n\nFinding an accountability partner is a golden rule in our pursuit of personal growth. This person does not necessarily have to be a close friend unless that is your preference. Look for someone with whom you can share daily progress updates. Consider them as your personal trainer, offering guidance and support, holding you accountable to your goals. It is remarkable how many individuals are willing to fulfill this role and actively help others.\n\nIn summary, as software developers, prioritizing our mental well-being is crucial. By seeking help, setting small fitness goals, adopting healthier eating habits, joining a community, assisting others, and finding an accountability partner, we can significantly improve our overall mental state and achieve personal growth. Remember, taking care of ourselves allows us to be the best version of ourselves, both personally and professionally. END"}

In 1983, Edward R. Tufts introduced the concept of data-ink ratio in his influential work, 'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.' This concept emphasizes the removal of non-data ink or pixels to enhance the ability of data to convey its intended message. Serious practitioners in the field of data visualization are likely familiar with this concept. The data-ink ratio is often applied to dashboards and other visualizations designed for an audience already interested in the subject. However, if our goal is to convert and engage people in our story, strictly adhering to the data-ink ratio may lead to a loss of user engagement during the onboarding process. By solely focusing on maximizing data-to-ink proportion, we risk overlooking key contextual information that aids comprehension. In this article, I will highlight three key reasons why designers should consider incorporating onboarding into their data visualization strategies: addressing ambiguity, managing the irreversible growth of data, and optimizing conversion rates.\"\n\n\"One of the primary reasons to consider incorporating onboarding into data visualization is the inherent ambiguity in presenting complex information. Most data visualizations communicate multiple stories simultaneously. The so-called 'curse of knowledge,' as Steven Francine aptly pointed out at the OpenVAS Conference in 2018, suggests that knowledge and expertise can significantly influence our perception of visual representations. When creating intricate visualizations on a specific topic, the experts in that field might interpret the visualization differently due to their domain-specific knowledge. Onboarding can greatly mitigate this ambiguity, providing users with the necessary guidance and context to better understand the message conveyed by the data visualization.\"\n\n\"In addition to human-induced plastic pollution in our oceans, we are also responsible for the exponential growth of data. Expanding technological capabilities and software intelligence allow us to unravel the complex web of data relations. However, the challenge lies in effectively communicating the story behind this unfolded, intricate data. Most people are familiar with common graph types such as line graphs, bar charts, and scatter plots, primarily due to their introduction during primary and high school education. However, these traditional visualization techniques may not always efficiently convey highly complex narratives. Marten Albrecht suggests that embracing the spirit of William Play fair, the pioneer of the bar chart, line graph, and unfortunately, the pie chart, can offer a solution. By creating custom and innovative visualizations, we can combine multiple dimensions, thereby unlocking deeper insights from complex data. Nevertheless, these unconventional visualizations require onboarding to unveil their true potential and assist users in grasping their intricacies.\"\n\n\"A critical aspect of successful data visualization lies in facilitating quick and easy comprehension of how the visualization works and what it means for the viewers. We can draw insights from Ran's Larsen's somewhat unscientific depiction of an 'inform,' which illustrates his process of information digestion when encountering an infographic. Initially, Ran experiences excitement and instant understanding, but soon realizes that there is more to comprehend. Gradually, he deconstructs the infographic, treating it like a paragraph and uncovering its layers. From a conversion standpoint, it is essential to recognize that users require rapid understanding of the visualization and its relevance to them. Research conducted by Lifeguard, Fernandes, Dude, and Brown in 2006 suggests that people form quick judgments about websites at first glance, which speaks to their limited attention span. By gradually storytelling and employing onboarding techniques, we can capture and sustain their attention.\"\n\n\"In conclusion, incorporating onboarding into data visualization can address the inherent ambiguity, effectively manage the ever-growing volumes of data, and optimize conversion rates. By guiding users through the visualization process and providing contextual information, we can enhance their comprehension and engagement with the data story. To create impactful and persuasive visualizations, it is crucial to strike a balance between maximizing the data-ink ratio and presenting sufficient context for effective communication.\" END"}

However, he soon realized that he lacked the guidance of a mentor or a community with whom he could exchange ideas and receive feedback. In order to overcome this obstacle, Keats resolved to immerse himself in the works of renowned poets, carefully studying their styles. Through diligent practice, he began crafting verses in large quantities, steadily improving his skills while also discovering his own unique voice by emulating his literary idols. As his love for poetry deepened, Keats felt the need to undertake more challenging endeavors in order to master this beloved art form.\n\nOne such undertaking was the ambitious task of writing a lengthy poem composed of precisely 4000 lines. Centered around the ancient Greek myth of Endymion, this poem would serve as a testament to Keats' imaginative and inventive powers. Setting a seemingly impossible deadline of seven months, he committed himself to writing fifty lines each day. This endeavor proved to be arduous, causing Keats to grow disenchanted with his own writing. Within just a few lines of the poem, he realized that his prose contained an excess of unnecessary words, including clich\u00e9s. Though he was frustrated by the realization that he fell far short of his own perceived proficiency, he found solace in the fact that this exercise shed light on his weaknesses.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Keats persevered and completed the poem. While he considered \"Endymion\" to be a mediocre piece, the lessons he gleaned from this demanding challenge would forever transform his approach to writing. He learned not to rely on his emotional state when it came to writing, understanding that what truly mattered was simply beginning and persisting with the task at hand. The best ideas, Keats realized, arose while he was actively engaged in the writing process, rather than ruminating over his shortcomings. He had cultivated the habit of writing with speed, intensity, and concentration, tirelessly scrutinizing his own flaws.\n\nArmed with these invaluable insights gained from years of dedicated practice and self-criticism, Keats would go on to produce a collection of timeless poems and odes that would continue to be celebrated long after his untimely passing at the age of 25 in 1821, succumbing to a tuberculosis infection in Rome. The years between 1818 and 1819 were undeniably the most fruitful and prolific period in the annals of Western literature. Although his life was tragically cut short, Keats' literary legacy soared to great heights due to the resplendence of his writings. END"}

While many individuals prioritize wanting to be thinner, look better in a bathing suit, or gain more muscle, these goals often lead to frustration and burnout. Instead, the primary motivation for exercise should come from how it makes you feel \u2013 because exercise feels good.\n\nThe feeling of being in the \"groove\" is what I personally chase every day when I go out for a run. It's that state where everything is flowing effortlessly, time goes by quickly, and motivation is high. The sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after completing a workout is addictive. Once you experience this feeling, you will want to keep coming back for more.\n\nIn moments when motivation is lacking, it can be helpful to focus on exercising by feel. Don't worry about specific metrics like weight, sets, reps, time, or distance. Simply show up and do whatever feels right At that moment. By removing the limitations of expectations, it becomes easier to find the \"groove.\"\n\nWhile competition can drive ambition and tenacity, an excessive emphasis on competition can lead to negative outcomes such as obsession and burnout. Too much competition may result in injuries, plateaus, or overall dissatisfaction. Prioritizing completion over winning can alleviate the pressure. Instead of worrying about how fast you run or how much weight you lift, focus on completing the intended mileage or exercise routine.\n\nIt is also important to disregard the opinions of others, particularly when it comes to your exercise choices. People often exhibit an inexplicable interest in the decisions we make regarding exercise, diet, and daily habits. Learning to ignore the naysayers and not allow their judgments to affect our choices is crucial. Prioritizing what is best for oneself should not be considered a personal affront to others. Over time, with practice and determination, we can develop the ability to ignore and resist the resistance from others.\n\nPersonally, I believe in the power of exercising alone. While group exercise sessions have been shown to increase motivation, building confidence in oneself is equally important. Exercising alone allows one to focus on personal goals without the need to please anyone else. Once you have developed confidence in yourself and your plan, you can gradually reintroduce group exercise sessions if desired. I find that the \"groove\" is easier to find in a solo setting.\n\nUltimately, prioritize your strength, safety, and well-being. Remember, exercise should be about how it makes you feel and the positive impact it has on your overall health and fitness journey. END"}

However, for transgender individuals, this experience can quickly escalate from being frightening to an absolute nightmare. In this article, I will share my recent experience in a psychiatric facility.\n\nLast week, on a Tuesday night, I was experiencing extreme anxiety and the early signs of a panic attack. Although I have always dealt with anxiety, this was a different level of severity. My usual coping mechanisms were not effective, and I was desperate to find relief. Recognizing the progression of my symptoms, I decided to seek help at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (COLA). After undergoing a thorough psychological evaluation, it was determined that I was not safe and needed to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital for a mandatory 72-hour hold known as a 5150.\n\nGiven that COLA does not offer inpatient psychiatric care, I was informed that I would be transported to a different hospital. Learning this news sent a wave of anxiety through me. I repeatedly asked the emergency room doctor if the hospital they were sending me to was transgender-friendly. I needed reassurance that I would be treated with respect and understanding. The doctor assured me that my well-being was their top priority. Placed tightly and immobilized on a hospital bed, I was then moved onto a gurney to be taken to Del AMO Hospital in Torrance, California.\n\nHanding over my California ID card and Medical health insurance card to the intake nurse at Del AMO, the process of filling out paperwork began. Strapped down and still tightly bound, I wished I could document the marks left on my shoulders by the straps. Unfortunately, they disappeared by the time I was discharged. During the intake, the nurse came across a question regarding my sex, and she hesitated upon seeing my ID and insurance card, both of which identified me as male. She ultimately skipped the question and proceeded with the rest of the paperwork. Finally released from the constraints of the gurney, I struggled to regain mobility as my legs were sore from being locked in a straight position for an extended period. In response to this, she summoned a male intake nurse and directed me to a restroom to change into a hospital gown. She explained that this was part of a safety check due to uncertainty about my gender to ensure the safety of all patients.\n\nFor three hours, I was placed in an observation room while nurses attentively recorded my every move and breath. Following this period, I was placed in an isolation room at the end of the hallway in the female wing of the youth unit. The room had no windows, only four walls, and a toilet attached to the wall. The door closed, and I found myself locked in. Nurses checked on the patients every two hours, or at least that is how it felt. Any cries for help resulted in additional sedatives to induce sleep. During breakfast the next morning, I realized I was being treated differently from the other patients. I puzzled over why I was isolated, as I had cooperated with every request. I assumed that this was the typical experience for new patients. Time blurred in that confined space, anxiety growing as the off-white walls closed in.\n\nIn the afternoon, I had a brief consultation with the doctor. Unfortunately, during our conversation, the doctor seemed more interested in his cell phone, scrolling through Facebook and texting. Despite interruptions, he quickly diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder, depression, and anxiety. Based on this rushed exchange, he prescribed medication that he believed would alleviate my problems. I was handed a small cup filled with five pills by a nurse. Curious about their purpose and potential side effects, I asked for more information to make an informed decision, as I have the legal right to refuse medication in a psychiatric hospital. However, the nurse refused to disclose the specifics and insisted that refusal would extend my stay in the hospital. Faced with this ultimatum, I reluctantly took the pills. Without a clock in the room, I lost all sense of time. I recall spending much of that day sleeping but remain unsure about the duration and effects of the medication.\n\nUpon awakening the next morning, a nurse checked my vitals. Eager for information, I asked about the time and date. The nurse gave me an unkind look, jotted down the details, and left my room. Determined to stay awake, despite the sedating effects of the medication, I anxiously awaited the two-hour checkup to learn more about my treatment plan and the opportunity to participate in support groups and interact with other patients. Shockingly, I was informed that the hospital policy required my isolation. This decision was justified by stating that transgender individuals are at a higher risk of sexual assault and violence. At that moment, I realized that my 72-hour hospital stay was quickly turning into an agonizing nightmare.\n\nExercising my right to use the phone, I was allowed to make a call. Although monitored, I cautiously conveyed my discontent to the person on the other end. While they recognized something was wrong, they felt helpless in rectifying the situation. For the sake of expediting my release, I assured them that I was fine. There is a common misconception that testosterone inhibits the ability to cry. However, having been on hormone therapy for six months, I had not experienced this effect. In isolation, tears overwhelmed me, though I quickly wiped them away each time the nurses conducted their bi-hourly checks. Any display of vulnerability led to an additional day of confinement.\n\nI was not alone during these 72 hours. I shared a room with another transgender male. Although he spoke very little, his compassion provided solace. We found ways to pass the time, such as secretly holding hands from behind our beds, sharing a prolonged five-minute hug, and offering verbal validation when the nurses cisgendered or used dead names for us. He experienced a similar level of pain, despite being three years younger than me. I hold immense respect for him. Finally, after 72 hours of confinement, sunlight and freedom greeted me as I was released. I bid my roommate farewell, surreptitiously passing him my contact information on a small piece of paper. He remains held on a 30-day hold known as a 5270. Since my discharge, he has called me daily from the hospital phone. Although there is only so much I can do from outside the facility, I plan to visit him, even though returning is profoundly triggering.\n\nUpon sharing my distressing experience on social media after being discharged, I received an outpouring of support. Strangers sent messages of sympathy, and other transgender individuals who had encountered mistreatment at this hospital reached out to encourage legal action for the violation of patients' rights. Subsequently, I filed a complaint with the hospital. To my disappointment, a patient advocate dismissed my complaint, citing that I had been hospitalized for a reason. Seeking assistance from free LGBT legal aid organizations, I am committed to holding this facility accountable for their transphobic policies, which blatantly contradict basic civil rights. This experience has shed light on why transgender individuals harbor such disdain for psychiatric hospitals. It is disheartening that this is how we are treated when we seek help and support.\n\nNote: The original article has been edited for tone and clarity. END"}

use fewer throw pillows ? is it possible to repurpose old pillows into pet beds ? can you use old pillows to cushion your knees in the garden ? make soft toys for your pet ? can you give them to someone who\u2019s moving to use as a packing cushion ? i don\u2019t see pillow fights in the same light as i used to . can you imagine the plume of dead skin and polyester fibers that burst into the air when the pillows are beaten together ? heh . teabags / sachets teabags used to be made with silk or cotton . these days , they\u2019re more often made with paper coated with a thin layer of plastic . some are made entirely with polyester . the same goes for sugar/salt sachets too . they look like they\u2019re made with paper but they\u2019re lined with plastic . the solution to this is very simple . just go for loose tea leaves and buy sugar in bulk ! all you\u2019ll need is a tea ball/tea strainer . maybe i\u2019m paranoid , i never liked the idea of submerging plastic in boiling/hot water . i\u2019ll pick the tea ball over the teabag any day . besides , loose tea leaves are usually better in quality than the store-bought variety of tea bags and have a lower carbon footprint \u2014 simply because they aren\u2019t individually bagged . chewing gum traditionally , chewing gum was made from chicle , a resin from the sapodilla trees in mexico . these days , the chicle has been replaced with synthetic rubber , which is cheaper and is also\u2026 a type of plastic . gross , if you ask me . i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll ever want a stick of plastic gum anymore . that said , there are still gums that are plastic-free . two brands that i came across include glee gum and simply gum . if you\u2019re an avid gum chewer who doesn\u2019t mind regular gum , check this company out . they recycle chewed gum ! aluminum and tin cans boo ! out of this list , this is the one that disappointed me the most , but what did i expect ? most aluminum and tin cans are coated with a thin coat of plastic to prevent the metal from being corroded by the food . still better than plastic bottles though ! i\u2019m for the use of canned food and drinks , but if you aren\u2019t , you can always buy beans and grains at places that sell them in bulk . or choose products sold in glass jars . do note that the covid-19 has caused a temporary suspension of the use of personal bags at certain shops , so buying beans and grains with your own bag may not be possible at the moment . tetra paks you probably know this one already . tetra paks contain thin layers of plastic on both the internal and external walls of the packaging . tetra paks still beat plastic bottles if there\u2019s a recycling facility near you . however , i\u2019d choose aluminum and tin over a tetra pak if i\u2019m uncertain because aluminum and tin will have no problems getting recycled . clothes , bed linen , curtains \u2014 most things fabric thanks to the \u201caffordability\u201d of polyester , it\u2019s used to make everything from socks to clothes to carpet and bedsheets . the unseen price is microfiber pollution . there\u2019s no easy solution to this . tossing them away would cause waste , but washing them causes microfiber pollution . i recommend switching to preloved items made with natural fiber as the polyester ones wear out . if you can afford it , you can get guppyfriend bags to wash your polyester clothes in , install a lint luv-r in your washing machine to filter out the microfibers , or use these nifty vermont-made cora balls to catch the nasty microfibers . i\u2019m not affiliated with these products , but they\u2019re recommended by authoritative sites . produce sticker most produce stickers contain plastic . that\u2019s why zero-wasters peel them off and put them into their jars . these little buggers are the bane of my compost bin ! nah i\u2019m just kidding . it\u2019s a breeze to peel them off . owing to their size , we may either think that produce stickers are too small to matter in a compost bin , or they\u2019ll disintegrate because they\u2019re so small . but they contain plastic , so while they do disintegrate with time , it only means the plastic broke down to smaller bits and will now contaminate the soil . plastic has no place in the compost bin . trash the produce stickers ! to avoid produce stickers , go to a farmer\u2019s market . glitter glitter is a mixture of tiny plastic and aluminum fragments , which means glitter contains microplastic . if you\u2019ve used glitter , you\u2019ll know that it gets everywhere and is difficult to clean off surfaces ! what do we do when we get our hands full of glitter ?

From food packaging and bottles to furniture and electrical appliances, plastic is utilized extensively. However, there are several everyday items that might surprise you due to their hidden plastic content. Let's take a closer look at these items and explore some alternatives.\n\n1. Pillow Stuffing: Polyester is commonly used as pillow stuffing, although recycled plastic is not widely utilized due to its higher cost. While some manufacturers do create pillows from recycled polyester, finding them might require some effort. It's worth considering the lifespan and potential recycling options before purchasing new pillows. Can the old throw pillow be washed and reused? Could you repurpose it as a pet bed, garden cushion, or a soft toy?\n\n2. Teabags/Sachets: Teabags and sugar/salt sachets are often coated with a thin layer of plastic, even though they may appear to be made of paper. To steer clear of plastic, loose tea leaves and buying sugar in bulk are excellent alternatives. Using a tea ball or strainer will provide a delightful tea-drinking experience and reduce your carbon footprint.\n\n3. Chewing Gum: The traditional chicle gum made from resin has been replaced with synthetic rubber, which, unfortunately, is a type of plastic. However, there are still plastic-free gum options available in the market, such as Glee Gum and Simply Gum. Exploring these brands might be worthwhile if you are a gum enthusiast.\n\n4. Aluminum and Tin Cans: Surprisingly, most aluminum and tin cans are coated with plastic to prevent the food from corroding the metal. Nonetheless, using cans is still a preferable choice compared to plastic bottles. If you prefer to avoid cans, buying beans and grains in bulk or opting for products in glass jars are viable alternatives.\n\n5. Tetra Pass: Tetra Pass, despite their convenience and recallability in certain areas, contain layers of plastic both internally and externally. Although more sustainable than plastic bottles, choosing aluminum and tin cans is a safer bet for recycling. Always consider local recycling facilities when deciding which packaging to choose.\n\n6. Fabric-based Products: Polyester, due to its affordability, finds its way into a wide range of products, including clothes, bed linen, and curtains. However, washing these items releases microfibers, contributing to microfiber pollution. Consider purchasing removed items made with natural fibers as a sustainable alternative. Additionally, using products like Guppy friend bags or lint liver in your washing machine can filter out microfibers effectively.\n\n7. Produce Stickers: The seemingly harmless produce stickers actually contain plastic. To avoid contributing to plastic pollution, peel them off and dispose of them properly. Visiting farmer's markets can be a great solution to obtain produce without stickers.\n\n8. Glitter: Glitter consists of small plastic and aluminum particles, making it a source of microplastic pollution. Opt for biodegradable or edible glitter, especially when purchasing it for children, to minimize its impact on the environment.\n\n9. Craft Glue: Craft glue often contains polyvinyl acetate (PVA), which is a type of plastic. While it may not be a significant concern due to the relatively small amount used, exploring alternative options like starch-based glue for paper crafts can be an eco-friendly choice.\n\n10. Personal Products: Certain personal care items, such as masks, mascara, and hairspray, might also contain PVA. However, it's easy to find alternatives without plastic content by carefully examining the product ingredients.\n\nBy being mindful of these hidden plastic sources, we can make conscious choices that promote sustainability and reduce our environmental footprint.

{"prompt": "introduction to start with , let\u2019s take a brief look at what we should be understanding as concurrency and parallelism . concurrency in layman\u2019s terms , concurrency is the situation where , in order to solve a problem , we process it in a way that one single task gets processed concurrently by multiple workers that said , let\u2019s imagine a big array where we have multiple workers and each worker does some work on the next element to be processed in the array , until we reach the end of the array . when concurrency takes place , some synchronisation is required in order to access the resource that gets shared among all the existing workers ( in our example , this is the array ) . the complexity and performance overhead involved in this approach could be very significant in some cases we\u2019ll try to demonstrate this later on in this article . parallelism on the other hand , parallelism is the situation where , in order to solve a problem , we decide to take a \u201c divide and conquer\u201d approach and split the problem into multiple small problems . this allows us to solve multiple smaller problems in parallel . how would it look like using the same example we\u2019ve shown above ? let\u2019s imagine that we have four parallel workers . a parallel solution would be as shown below as you can see , the difference is substantial we have now four smaller tasks that can be solved independently . knowing this , we can affirm that the elements get processed sequentially by each worker ! when each worker has completed the task , we can then combine their results to produce one single and final result . the main benefit of this is that we don\u2019t need to synchronise the access of the workers to a shared resource now , each worker has its independent chunk of work to process . i hope the difference between these two is clear , but what\u2019s left ? we have one more case , which is quite obvious sequential processing . in a standard sequential process , we\u2019d be processing our task in sequential order with a single worker . this is the more common approach , and in some cases , it could surprisingly be the fastest ! if you need to have a better understanding about concurrency and multi-threading and why we do things in the way we do them nowadays , i\u2019d recommend that you read the book \u201cjava concurrency in practice\u201d by brian goetz .","completion": " Concurrency and parallelism are two concepts that are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings. In simple terms, concurrency refers to the scenario where multiple workers process a single task simultaneously in order to solve a problem. This often requires synchronization to ensure that a shared resource, such as an array in our example, is accessed properly by all workers. However, the complexity and performance overhead involved in this approach can be significant in certain cases.\n\nParallelism, on the other hand, involves dividing a problem into smaller tasks and solving them concurrently. This \"divide and conquer\" approach allows multiple workers to independently process smaller tasks in parallel. In our previous example, we illustrated this by having four parallel workers solving four smaller tasks sequentially. The main advantage of parallelism is that each worker has its independent chunk of work to process, eliminating the need for synchronization of a shared resource. Once each worker completes its task, their results can be combined to produce a final result.\n\nIt is important to note that there is also a third case, which is sequential processing. In a standard sequential process, a single worker processes the task in a sequential order. This is the more common approach and, surprisingly, it can be the fastest in some cases.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of concurrency, multi-threading, and modern approaches, we recommend reading the book \"Java Concurrency in Practice\" by Brian Get.

{"prompt": "how to read out your smart gas meter with a raspberry pi quick guide on how to setup a raspberry pi to read out a smart gas meter and setup a website to plot gas consumption over time . in the netherlands , most houses are heated with natural gas and most people use gas for cooking . over the last 10 years , the majority of houses switched to smart meters for gas and electricity . these meters make it possible for suppliers to remotely read out your consumption . unfortunately , less than 10% of home owners actually read out their gas meter themselves . this is a shame as it could help reduce consumption . reading out my smart gas meter with a raspberry pi zero i have a couple of raspberry pi\u2019s laying around and i took up a project to read out my smart gas meter and show the readings in a graph on a website . i used aws iot core to process the messages from the smart meter and aws dynamodb to store the readings . finally , the website is hosted on aws and protected by aws cognito ( not everyone needs to know how much gas i use ) . i assume you have some affinity with raspberry pi , python and aws to keep this quick guide relatively short . the end result looks like this cumulative gas consumption over time lets get started step 1 read out the smart gas meter with python each smart meter comes with a p1 port ( one of these old telephone connections ) , which you can connect to usb with the right cable . i used a pi zero without wifi , so had to use an usb to rj45 ethernet adapter ( full set up is shown in the picture above , the black cable is the p1-to-usb connector ) . to read out the meter i used this python script ( heavily borrowed from each meter type has a different message layout , which means you need to try different values in row 29 and row 43 . next step is to setup a messaging service to push the readings to aws iot core . step 2 setup aws iot core aws iot core provides secure communication between internet-connected devices such as sensors , actuators , embedded micro-controllers , or smart appliances and the aws cloud . it uses the mqtt machine-to-machine connectivity protocol . to setup a new thing , follow these steps in the aws iot core developer guide . register your thing in aws iot core download the things\u2019 certificates and store them on your pi . you also need to download the aws iot python sdk . to send messages to aws iot core i enhanced the previous script with a mqtt messaging script , see below . this script sends a message with the gas meter\u2019s reading to a so called \u2018topic\u2019 . within aws iot core you can subscribe to this topic and setup rules to process the incoming messages . before we do that we need to create a dynamodb database . step 3 setup dynamodb and a processing rule as i want to plot a historic trend of gas consumption , i need a database . for this project , a dynamodb is very suitable it is easy to set up and cheap . simply create a new table with datetime as the primary key . if you have multiple things you can use deviceid as primary key and datetime as sorting key and store everything in a single table . setup dynamodb to store gas meter readings now that we have a database , we need to set up a rule in aws iot core to process incoming messages and push them to the database . in my case the rule is quite simple send all messages from topic gas_reading to the dynamodb database gas_meter . you can do this in the act section of aws iot core . setup a rule to push topic messages to dynamodb step 4 schedule python script with crontab now that the \u2018pipeline\u2019 is setup , the python script can be scheduled at the desired interval . the easiest way to do this is by using crontab . on your pi , run crontab -e and add the following line at the bottom . this will run the script every 5 minutes . now , every 5 minutes a reading is taken from the smart meter , published to a topic in aws iot and pushed into the dynamodb . add a line to crontab to schedule the python script at the desired frequency step 5 setup a website to plot the graph the last step is to plot the values in a graph on a website . i am pretty new to front end development , so bear with me on this one . i assume you have some affinity with node . js as you need to install two modules . the first one is chart . js , a powerful module for creating nice graphs and the second one is moment . js as you are working with date time values and these can be quite tricky . to be able to connect to the dynamodb in aws you need to add a link to the aws sdk script ( through cdn ) . the most bear bone version of the html script is shown below . most bear bone html script to show the graph the function to create the graph is shown below . the most tricky part is to work with aws credentials as you don\u2019t want everyone to just query your cloud-based database . for local development it\u2019s fine to hard code aws credentials ( access key id and secret access key ) , but on a public website you need to secure access much more . i used aws cognito for that . chart . js file for the website to setup aws cognito you need to define three things user pool \u2014 who can login app client \u2014 to which application do they have access identify pool \u2014 which resources within aws can be accessed for this application by these users within aws , go to amazon cognito and click on \u2018manage user pools\u2019 first . start by setting up a user pool in aws cognito give your user pool a name and proceed with entering the details . note down the user pool id as you need this later . give your user pool a name and proceed with setup define details of the user pool once setup , go to \u2018users and groups\u2019 in the menu on the left and create a test user ( using a working email address ) . once setup , add a user for testing purposes the next step is to define an app client . do this by clicking on app client settings on the menu on the left . note down the app client id as you need this later . setup appclient as part of the app client setup , you need to define sign in and sign out urls . for development purposed you can use localhost on but all other urls have to use ( keep this in mind when setting up your website ) . setup urls for login and logout as a final step in setting up the app client , you need to define the domain which is needed in the authentication process . setup domain url this sounds like a whole lot of work , but things make sense as soon as you integrate this with your website . in order to trigger the authentication process you can define a button on your website with a url that combines the parameters that you defined above . the login url is setup as follows domain prefix> . auth . <your region> . amazoncognito . com/login ? client_id=<your app client id>&response_type=token&scope=aws . cognito . signin . user . admin+email+openid+phone&redirect_uri=<your callback url> once logged in , you want to be able to access the dynamodb with the gas meter readings . you do this by setting up a so called identity pool ( i . e . federated identity ) . now click on manage identity pools next step is to give the identity pool a name and specify the options ( defaults work fine ) . give your identity pool a name and create a new pool in the next screen take note of the identity pool id ( you need it later ) and create new iam roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users . when creating the roles , you need to specify to which aws services they have access and to which extent ( e . g . read or write ) . in this case , you want users to have read access to the dynamodb table containing the gas readings . take note of the pool id and define iam roles once this is setup , authenticated users get credentials to query the dynamodb with the gas readings . now update the chart . js file for the website by entering the identitypoolid and userpoolid in the correct places . the end result will be the graph i showed in the beginning of the article . the working website can be found at myhome . schrama . io . you will find some other features there as well , which i will write about in a next article . you can find the full code on github summary in this article i talked you through how you can use a raspberry pi to read out a smart gas meter , push the readings to a dynamodb using aws iot and visualize the readings on a website with credentials . for me this was a nice project to learn more about python , raspberry pi , aws , databases , iot and front end development . i also learned a lot about our gas consumption at home . by being more conscious about how much we consume , we now limit the time we shower and set the thermostat a few degrees lower . so , something positive for the environment as well . i hope you enjoyed reading this article and got enthusiastic to pick up a project like this yourself !","completion": " How to Read Your Smart Gas Meter with a Raspberry Pi: A Quick Guide\n\nIntroduction:\nIn the Netherlands, the majority of houses are heated with natural gas, and most people use gas for cooking. Over the past decade, smart meters for both gas and electricity have become the norm, allowing suppliers to remotely read your consumption. Unfortunately, less than 10% of homeowners actively read their gas meters themselves. This is a missed opportunity, as monitoring gas consumption can help reduce overall consumption. In this quick guide, we will walk you through setting up a Raspberry Pi to read out your smart gas meter and display the readings in a graph on a website.\n\nStep 1: Reading Out the Smart Gas Meter with Python\nEach smart meter comes with a P1 port, which can be connected to a USB port using the appropriate cable. In this guide, we used a Raspberry Pi Zero without Wi-Fi, so an Ethernet adapter was required. To read out the meter, we utilized a Python script (with some borrowed code) that accommodates the specific message layout of each meter type. Customization may be necessary in rows 29 and 43 of the script.\n\nStep 2: Setting Up AWS IoT Core\nAWS IoT Core provides secure communication between internet-connected devices and the AWS cloud. It utilizes the MQTT machine-to-machine connectivity protocol. To set up a new thing (in this case, your gas meter), you will need to follow the steps outlined in the AWS IoT Core developer guide. This involves registering your thing in AWS IoT Core, downloading the necessary certificates, and storing them on your Raspberry Pi. Additionally, you will need to download the AWS IoT Python SDK. We enhanced the previous Python script with an MQTT messaging script to send gas meter readings to a specific topic within AWS IoT Core.\n\nStep 3: Setting Up DynamoDB and a Processing Rule\nIn order to plot a historic trend of gas consumption, a database is required. For this project, DynamoDB is a suitable and cost-effective option. Create a new table with date time as the primary key. If you have multiple things, you can use device id as the primary key and date time as the sorting key, storing everything in a single table. Once the database is set up, create a rule in AWS IoT Core to process incoming messages and push them to DynamoDB. The rule in this case is simple: it sends all messages from the topic \"gas_reading\" to the DynamoDB table \"gas_meter.\"\n\nStep 4: Scheduling the Python Script with Crontab\nNow that the pipeline is set up, the Python script can be scheduled to run at the desired interval. The easiest way to achieve this is by using crontab. Simply run \"crontab -e\" on your Raspberry Pi and add a line at the bottom to run the script at the desired frequency.\n\nStep 5: Setting Up a Website to Plot the Graph\nThe final step is to plot the gas meter readings on a website. This involves installing two modules: Chart.js and Moment.js. Chart.js is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing graphs, while Moment.js helps with handling date and time values. Additionally, a link to the AWS SDK script needs to be added to enable connection to DynamoDB in AWS. The provided HTML script serves as a starting point for displaying the graph.\n\nTo secure access to the cloud-based database on a public website, AWS Cognate is used. This involves defining a user pool, app client, and identity pool. These steps allow for user authentication and access control. The details and setup process for AWS Cognate can be found in the article.\n\nConclusion:\nBy following this guide, you can utilize a Raspberry Pi to read out your smart gas meter, push the readings to DynamoDB using AWS IoT Core, and visualize the data on a secure website. This project offers an opportunity to gain experience in Python, Raspberry Pi, AWS, databases, IoT, and front-end development. By monitoring your gas consumption and making conscious efforts to reduce it, you can have a positive impact on the environment. We hope you have enjoyed reading this article and feel inspired to take on a project like this yourself! END"}

i tried to ignore it for as long as possible . but as the evening went on it kept happening . i tried to wake my little brother up , but he was out cold . i decided that it had to be the television . so i turned it off . without the ambient noise , the sound became clear , and all the more unsettling . it was someone singing . it was clearer now . it was definitely a little girl\u2019s voices . \u201cring-around-the-rosie , pocketful of posies , ashes , ashes , we all fall down . \u201d it repeated over and over again . now imagine you\u2019re ten years old . you\u2019re sitting in the dark , and then you hear some little girl singing ring around the rosie . i was terrified . i was convinced that i was being haunted . i\u2019d only seen a few horror movies at this point but i knew what was coming . i tried to get my mom to come listen but she thought it was just me trying to get out of going to bed . to be fair , i had a rather active imagination at this time and had a penchant for making up stories . thrice i was rejected in my pleas to have her come and listen because someone was singing outside my room . i must have sounded insane . finally , she came to my room with me . sure enough , she could hear it too . ever the smug little rascal , i immediately quipped , \u201ci told you . \u201d however , she was far too curious and downright worried why there was someone singing outside the house . she was worried enough to call my father at work . he asked if the dog was barking or seemed to be worried . at the time , we had a truly massive canine guardian who loved patroling the house at night . but she was sleeping soundly . he assured her it had to be nothing . he offered to come home and take a look , but she declined figuring there had to be an explanation . we let the dog out . she wandered into the night , but we heard no commotion . if someone had physically been in our yard they would have been mincemeat . but the dog roamed around casually . we joined her outside . i was holding the flashlight . this was well before the days of high powered led lights that could brighten the whole yard . the only light source we had was a maglight the size of a little league bat . we could hear the singing clearer now . still going strong . i cast the light around the yard . nothing . the yard was empty , or so i thought . so we wandered onto the grass . this would be the point in the story where people would be screaming \u201cno\u201d at the screen in a horror movie . we walked further into the black void , with just a small cone of light in front of us . the light chose that evening to start waning . we went farther out . the singing got louder . finally , i looked down , and found out what was making the noise . this is where i interrupt the story to insert a critical detail . you see about six months prior , my sister got a doll for christmas . it was one that sang when you held both its hands . however , my sister grew tired of it rather quickly , and no one saw much of the doll after a week . until she happened to take that very doll outside during the day . the same day we got the surprise summer storm and didn\u2019t have time to pick everything up . no one knew the doll was outside . heck , everyone forgot the doll existed . guess what song the doll sang when you pressed the hands ? now , the doll was laying out on the ground just singing away , but no one was holding it . that\u2019s when my mother figured the rain shorted something and as soon as she pulled the battery out the singing stopped . i don\u2019t know if i\u2019d ever been that relieved . my mom put on a brave face , but later she told me how freaked out she was hearing the singing . after that we went back inside . my mom let me play video games even though it was well past my bedtime , because i had so freaked out i don\u2019t think she really wanted to say no . and i went back to the bedroom and turned on the playstation , excited that the only sound was coming from the television . my mom kissed me on the forehead and told me to not get too loud so i wouldn\u2019t wake my brother . now we laugh about it , but man that was a freaky night . we were both so relieved that it was just a malfunctioning electronic toy . it was kind of funny though . even though it wasn\u2019t singing my mom still left the thing outside . it went out in the trash the next day .","completion": " I am here to provide you with a revised version of your story, written in a professional tone:\n\nOnce upon a time, a peculiar incident took place during a summer storm in the Midwest. As accustomed to such weather in this region, the day started scorching hot and dry, forcing everyone to seek shelter or find solace under shades. On this particular day, however, the anticipation of the ice cream truck's arrival kept us stationed in the front yard, seeking any respite from the sweltering heat. Little did we know, the skies would soon open up, unleashing a torrential downpour upon us. In a matter of moments, we were forced to flee indoors, with no time to gather our belongings, resulting in our clothes being drenched completely.\n\nThe rain cascaded down relentlessly, transforming the previously parched earth into a muddy terrain and causing the front yard to flood rapidly. Initially, this turn of events meant that we were unable to engage in any outdoor activities. Fortunately, every cloud has a silver lining. Our mother, unable to coerce us to venture outdoors, granted us permission to indulge in our newfound obsession, the PlayStation. Thus, the rest of the day was spent competing in an exhilarating game of Crash Team Racing.\n\nEventually, the rain ceased, and life returned to its usual rhythm. We sat down for dinner and continued to play video games until it was time to retire for the night. Just as the door closed behind me, I slyly turned on the television, enticed by the freedom of staying up late, even if only infomercials were on air. It was during that quiet moment that an unsettling sound reached my ears. At first, the faint noise resembled a distant melody, resembling... singing? I attempted to ignore it, hoping it would fade away. As the evening progressed, however, the singing persisted. Desperate for solace, I tried to awaken my younger brother, only to find that he was sound asleep, oblivious to the eerie chorus surrounding us.\n\nConvinced that the source of this perplexing phenomenon was the television, I promptly switched it off. Yet, as the ambient noise vanished, the singing grew louder and clearer. It was undeniably the voice of a young girl, repeatedly serenading us with the chilling nursery rhyme, \"Ring Around the Rosie.\" As a ten-year-old child, engulfed in darkness, listening to the haunting melody of a little girl, escalating fear consumed me. Convinced that we were being plagued by a supernatural presence, I desperately sought my mother's assistance. Sadly, she dismissed my concerns as a mere ploy to evade bedtime, attributing them to my active imagination and penchant for weaving tales.\n\nRepeatedly rejected, I persisted until my mother reluctantly decided to accompany me to my bedroom. To her astonishment, the haunting singing reached her ears too. Smirking with a mischievous sense of vindication, I triumphantly declared, \"I told you so.\" However, curiosity and genuine worry compelled my mother to contact my father, who was at work at the time. Inquiring if our dog exhibited any signs of agitation or barking, my mother found solace in knowing our large, formidable guardian was at rest. Nonetheless, my father offered to return home to investigate further, an offer which my mother declined, steadfast in her belief that a logical explanation existed.\n\nUnleashing our dog into the night, we ventured outside to confront the enigmatic melody. Armed with only a dimly lit flashlight, as powerful LED lights had yet to come to fruition, we explored the dark expanse of our yard. The feeble illumination cast shadowy figures, intensifying the mysterious atmosphere. Amplified by our growing proximity, the singing resonated throughout the yard. Eventually, I gazed downward, discovering the source of our disturbance. At this point, an essential detail requires emphasis \u2013 six months prior, my sister had received a singing doll as a Christmas gift. When both hands were held, the doll would commence its musical performance. However, my sister quickly grew disinterested, causing the doll to vanish from our daily lives. It was only by happenstance that it had been left outside during the storm, amidst the rush to seek shelter. Unbeknownst to anyone, this forgotten doll had been the culprit all along.\n\nResting on the ground, the doll continued singing incessantly, yearning for attention that no longer reached it. Upon removing its battery, my mother concluded that the rain had likely caused a malfunction, triggering the unending melody. Relief washed over us, realizing that the haunting had been nothing more than a malfunctioning electronic toy. Although my mother maintained a courageous facade, she shyly confessed to her own apprehension during those disconcerting moments of the evening. Returning indoors, she permitted me to continue playing video games past my bedtime, hesitating to refuse my request after witnessing the terror I had experienced. As I returned to my bedroom, basking in the sanctuary of the television's sound, my mother gently kissed my forehead and advised me to refrain from waking my slumbering brother. Years later, we would laugh at the memory, grateful that our supernatural fears had been dispelled by a harmless malfunction. Nonetheless, to err on the side of caution, my mother amusingly banished the doll to the outdoor realm. Its fate was sealed when it found itself amid the trash the following day. END"}
{"prompt": "details about our buddy co2 co2 ( or carbon dioxide ) is a natural gas that allows sunlight to reach the earth . how so ? well , let\u2019s take a look at the diagram below first we can see that when the sun emits solar energy , it can go two ways . either in space or in the earth surface . however , this distribution is not proportionate , the majority goes to the earth . thus warming and increasing its temperature . hold up ! why does the heat of the sun get absorbed by the earth\u2019s crust more than space ? so remember our buddy co2 ? carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas ( ghg ) , which means that it is a very weak absorber in terms of incoming solar radiation . furthermore , because it is unable to prevent the solar radiation that enters the earth\u2019s surface , the heat comes rushing through without further protection . think of co2 like a phony soldier . it tries to give the allure that it can protect the noble earth . but in fact , it lets the solar radiation ( i . e . the \u201cenemies\u201d ) to race through which heats the earth . because co2 can\u2019t absorb the solar energy of the sun , it will instead emit it . the emission of this infrared radiation ( heat of the sunlight ) is propagated and directed downwards towards the earth . that\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s only directed towards the earth\u2019s crust . sure , some of the rays will go outward towards space but only minimally . should i curse co2 molecules ? of course not . in fact , if it weren\u2019t for this process which is called the greenhouse effect , our earth would be approximately -18 degrees celsius ! that\u2019s like living on an iceberg in iceland ! if it weren\u2019t for the weakness of this greenhouse gas , there would not be any entrapment of solar radiation on our planet . therefore , without it , our earth would not be habitable . here\u2019s the difference between what happens when it\u2019s an incoming radiation ( coming from the sun ) vs . an outgoing radiation ( reflected by the earth ) uhh\u2026 remind me what the problem is ? anything that is done excessively to the environment is by consequence adverse . because there has been an excess amount of mining for fossil fuels , this creates a temperature imbalance . the more co2 is released into the earth\u2019s atmosphere = the warmer the earth becomes ( because the majority of the infrared radiation is directed to the earth by the co2 molecules ) . greenhouse gases such as co2 are the main contributors to global warming which is deteriorating the environment ( icebergs melting , wildlife losing their habitats , inundations evoked by excess of water melted etc . ) . you might be wondering \u201cwell kawtar , why are you only talking about co2 ? \u201d good question ! it\u2019s because not only is co2 the most abundant greenhouse gas on earth , but it\u2019s also the one that shows the most potential to improve our earth\u2019s circumstance . i know , seems pretty contradictory . it\u2019s the most plentiful but it also shows the most potential to help ? let me explain . the process of capturing co2 one of the most promising initiatives in terms of reducing the establishment of climate change is to quite literally , capture the co2 emissions that amplify and initiate the earth\u2019s immoderate heating . in other words , it\u2019s putting the carbon dioxide emissions back where it came from ( underground ) ! there are three steps that involve carbon capture separating and trapping the co2 from other gases . transporting the substance to a storage location . storing and secluding it away from the atmosphere . mechanism of the separation there are various methods to separate co2 from other gases . some utilize a \u201cfilter\u201d which contains a solvent that absorbs co2 . this solvent is later heated which will liberate water vapor and leave a concentrated amount of co2 as residue . there is also the process of calcination ( essentially heating a solid to a boiling high temperature to remove the co2 ) , selective membranes ( acts like the filter , clogs in the co2 ) etc . if we have all these mechanisms , how come the progress of carbon capture has been so slow with only 22 projects around the world ? well , let\u2019s just say that these processes tend to require a lot of cha-ching $$$ ( specifically direct air capture ) , time and resources . so , to make carbon capture a universal objective , companies need to allocate these facilities and take the initiative of becoming carbon negative . companies like climeworks are pioneering the carbon capture industry by installing the world\u2019s first direct air capture facility . air is drawn into the collector by a fan . then , a filter which acts as a selective layer , gets co2 on the surface and is closed . finally , the container is heated to the temperature that will release ( and separate ) the carbon dioxide from the substance . transportation of the substance firstly , what do we use to transport the substance ? pipelines . they start at the source of capture and goes to its storage location . co2 is usually travelled in its gaseous state . however , i am quite uneasy and hesitant about the usage of pipelines . although they are the safest way to transport oils ( in terms of their quality ) , there are still ethical concerns tied to this method , like the perturbation this would pose on indigenous communities . it wouldn\u2019t make sense to solve a problem while simultaneously creating another . one of the greatest flaws of carbon capture is that the actual transportation of the matter disturbs indigenous folk . yes , it is the most environmentally-friendly option compared to trains or trucks . however , that should not infringe or pose a threat to the land that other people step on . where the heck is it stored ?

When the sun emits solar energy, it can either be absorbed by the Earth's surface or go into space. However, this distribution is not proportional, with the majority of the solar energy being absorbed by the Earth's surface. This absorption contributes to warming and an increase in temperature.\n\nWhy does the heat of the sun get absorbed more by the Earth's crust than space? This is where CO2 comes into play. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas (GHG), which means it has a weak ability to absorb incoming solar radiation. As a result, it is unable to prevent solar radiation from entering the Earth's surface, allowing heat to pass through without further protection. Think of CO2 as a phony soldier, pretending to protect the Earth while actually allowing solar radiation to heat it up.\n\nSince CO2 cannot absorb the solar energy, it instead emits it. This emission of infrared radiation, or heat from the sunlight, is propagated and directed downward towards the Earth. While some radiation will go outward towards space, the majority is directed towards the Earth's crust. Without CO2, our Earth would be approximately -18 degrees Celsius, which would make it uninhabitable.\n\nExcessive actions that impact the environment have adverse consequences. The excess release of CO2 into the Earth's atmosphere contributes to global warming, which leads to the deterioration of the environment. This includes melting icebergs, loss of wildlife habitats, and flooding caused by excessive water melting. Therefore, CO2 and other greenhouse gases are the main contributors to these environmental issues.\n\nWhy focus on CO2? CO2 is the most abundant greenhouse gas on Earth and shows the greatest potential to improve our planet's situation. One of the most promising initiatives to combat climate change is the capture of CO2 emissions. This process involves capturing and storing the CO2 back underground, essentially returning it to its original source.\n\nThere are three steps involved in carbon capture: separating and trapping CO2 from other gases, transporting the captured CO2 to a storage location, and secluding it away from the atmosphere. Various methods, such as filters containing solvents that absorb CO2 or calculation, can be used to separate CO2 from other gases.\n\nHowever, the progress of carbon capture has been slow, with only 22 projects worldwide. These processes require significant financial investments, time, and resources, especially direct air capture. To make carbon capture a universal objective, companies need to allocate resources and take the initiative to become carbon negative. Pioneering companies like Clime works are leading the way in the carbon capture industry by installing the world's first direct air capture facility.\n\nTransportation of the captured CO2 usually involves pipelines. While pipelines are the safest option, ethically concerns regarding their impact on indigenous communities arise. It's crucial to find ways to solve the carbon capture problem without creating new problems for these communities.\n\nOnce the captured CO2 reaches its storage location, it can be safely stored away from the atmosphere. Underground storage, known as geological sequestration, involves storing CO2 deep underground where overlying rocks form a seal that ensures its entrapment. Another option is dumping CO2 into the ocean at depths greater than 3500 meters, where it is predicted to convert into a slushy form and not resurface.\n\nIn conclusion, carbon capture has both benefits and risks. It represents one of the most promising emerging technologies to directly capture excess CO2 and reduce global warming. However, the mechanisms involved may pose ethical issues and commercialization challenges. Addressing concerns related to indigenous land, conducting more tests to validate predictions, and finding effective ways to market carbon capture can help overcome these challenges and ensure its positive impact on preventing climate change.

Firstly, I check if the module adheres to a coding standard. This can be determined by whether the module includes a lint command or if the README states that a coding standard is being followed. While I do have my own coding preference in JavaScript, I am not overly concerned about which specific standard is used, as long as one is followed. It is crucial to work with well-formatted code to avoid any complications when referring to the module's source code in the future.\n\nAnother important consideration is whether the module incorporates automated tests. Furthermore, it is beneficial if these tests are run automatically by a continuous integration (CI) system, and if the README includes a badge indicating the current build/test state. With the prevalence of cloud-based CI services these days, there is hardly any reasonable excuse not to utilize them, even for smaller projects. I want to emphasize that, although a badge may indicate a build failure, it is important to verify the status by clicking on the badge as web caching can sometimes interfere with accurate display. Additionally, the failure of certain environments or versions specified in the build matrix may not necessarily be problematic.\n\nI also take into account whether the module follows semantic versioning (SemVer) and if the current release is at version 1.0.0 or higher. While applying SemVer correctly can be challenging, I appreciate the effort made by developers to adhere to this versioning concept. On the other hand, I tend to be wary of modules that are stuck in a perpetual \"not ready for prime time\" state with a major version of 0, even if they are popular and fulfill an important need. Such cases raise concerns about reliability and consistency. SemVer implementation, in my opinion, demonstrates respect and consideration for others. If we intend to release something \"into the wild,\" it is essential to provide and communicate a certain level of stability.\n\nFurthermore, I consider whether the module's API follows a style or pattern (functional vs. imperative, fluent, declarative, etc.) that aligns with my personal programming preferences. API design plays a crucial role in usability, and some APIs are more intuitive than others. The availability of multiple module choices allows us to select one that best matches our preferences.

Despite the update, curation still exists, and your story will still be curated into relevant topics. To gain a better understanding of these changes, let's dive into the new plan known as \"relational medium\" and take a look at the latest updates from Medium's CEO, Ev Williams.\n\nOne notable change is the introduction of a new mobile app. Unlike before, the algorithm will now prioritize your following list over topics when determining which stories to display. So, if you have a large following on Medium, your stories will become more accessible to your readers. This shift is advantageous for top writers with substantial followings, as it enhances their exposure. However, if you have a modest following, it appears that your visibility may be limited.\n\nPreviously, if you followed the topic of \"fitness,\" you would see stories related to fitness in your feed, including those from both familiar and new writers. However, with the new approach, the stories you see will be determined by the writers you follow rather than the topics you follow. Although I haven't had the chance to personally test the updated app, based on a screenshot from Williams's article, it seems that your feed will display a row of authors from your followers. By clicking on any of them, you will be directed to their profile page, where you can read their latest articles. While this change benefits top writers, it might pose challenges for new writers in gaining exposure for their stories.\n\nFurthermore, writers with multiple niches might encounter difficulties. As an example, I primarily write about health and fitness, but I also delve into parenting, the environment, and occasionally poetry. The beauty of Medium in the past was that it allowed me to express my creativity and write about different subjects that pique my interest. The algorithms curated my articles accordingly, presenting them to the relevant audience. However, with the new system, there is a risk that those who click on my profile might be overwhelmed with an assortment of diverse content, potentially limiting their interest in my work.\n\nAdditionally, I have pondered how this change will influence my media consumption habits. When I read The New York Times or navigate through Google News, I don't specifically seek out my favorite columnists; instead, I read headlines that catch my attention within the topics I'm interested in. Williams aims to foster deeper relationships between authors and readers with this update. Unfortunately, a side effect of this shift is that it may become even more challenging to discover new voices on Medium.\n\nIn conclusion, Medium's recent changes to its curation and distribution system have both positive and negative implications for users. While authors with substantial followings will benefit from increased exposure, new writers and those with multiple niches may struggle to reach their intended audience. Additionally, the focus on developing deeper relationships may make it more difficult to discover fresh voices on the platform. END"}

The choice between the two depends on the scenario.\n\nLet's consider an example where we have a button that can be enabled or disabled, controlled by a state variable called \"disabled\" holding a boolean value. It may be tempting to write the following code to toggle the button's state:\n\n```JavaScript\n// Initial setup\ncoast [disabled, setIsDisabled] = estate(false);\n\n// Modifying the state later\nsetIsDisabled(!disabled);\n```\n\nHowever, there is a problem with this approach. React state updates can be batched, meaning multiple state updates can occur in a single update cycle. If updates to the enabled/disabled state were to be batched and there were multiple updates, the end result may not be as expected.\n\nA better way to update the state in this scenario would be to provide a function that uses the previous state as an argument:\n\n```JavaScript\n// Initial setup\ncoast [disabled, setIsDisabled] = estate(false);\n\n// Modifying the state later\nsetIsDisabled(prestate \u2192 !prestate);\n```\n\nBy using this approach, even if state updates are batched and multiple updates are made to the enabled/disabled state together, each update relies on the correct previous state. This ensures that the end result will always be what is expected.\n\nThe same principle applies when incrementing a counter. Instead of directly setting the state using a value, it is recommended to use a function that takes the previous state into account:\n\n```JavaScript\n// Initial setup\ncoast [undervalue, setCounterValue] = estate(0);\n\n// Modifying the state later\nsetCounterValue(prestate \u2192 prestate + 1);\n```\n\nThe key point here is that if the new state value relies on the value of the previous state, it is essential to use a function as the argument. On the other hand, if you are setting a value that does not depend on the old state, you can use a direct value as the argument. END"}

Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a trade delegation of Russian cyber-security companies, where the focus was on promoting the Kokomo Foundation. The Kokomo Foundation is an ambitious initiative aiming to create a startup town just outside Moscow, with a goal of having 1400 startups across various sectors by 2020. This event showcased not just startups, but scale-ups that already had established clients, primarily in the Russian sphere, but were eager to expand their Western connections.\n\nThe central theme of the event was pitching trust. Some companies successfully conveyed this message, while others failed to resonate with British sensitivities. Ilya Sachs, the CEO of Group-IB, began his pitch with an intriguing story about a movie company that approached them with a script about cybersecurity. Instead of developing software to protect against attacks, Group-IB specializes in threat detection by proactively tracking and identifying potential agents. Unbeknownst to them, the movie company they worked with was financed by the very organization they were investigating, leading to a newfound level of internal paranoia within Group-IB.\n\nSergey Kodak, representing the Kokomo Foundation, made a compelling case for their approach to cybersecurity. He emphasized that countries with expertise in building effective tools are best equipped to defend against them. Russian cybersecurity companies typically start with penetration testing, and once they gain trust in that field, it becomes easier for them to sell their products to corporations.\n\nOther companies focused on pitching the features of their employee monitoring software, but perhaps missed the mark with British sensitivities by being unapologetically Russian in their approach. When questioned about the legality of monitoring employees to such an extent, one presenter casually responded, \"...don't worry...there is a checkbox you can uptick.\"\n\nDespite geopolitical tensions, business between Russian and British companies continues. One attendee from accelerate, a data center with facilities in Moscow, highlighted that while there are blacklists of individuals that companies should avoid, there are still good people conducting legitimate business across borders. Although the blacklists have expanded since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, business operations have not ceased.\n\nIn the world of startups, successful entrepreneurs often possess a certain level of \"naughtiness.\" While they may be ethically sound and focused on tackling significant challenges, they do not necessarily adhere to conventional norms. They care more about getting the big questions right than about following proprieties.\n\nAs the Kokomo pitches wrapped up, one particularly daring entrepreneur leaned over to me and mentioned that Kim Philby, a former head of MI5 and a Russian spy, had visited the same building we were in. While this comment would be deemed entirely inappropriate when it comes to inspiring trust in corporate clients, it served as a unique bonding experience for these audacious individuals.\n\nDr. Finn MacLeod works for Zenlikefocus.com, a service dedicated to helping startups enhance their presence and sales through intelligent social media growth strategies.

Your career should mimic this beautiful hike, working towards a peak or a finish that brings you great fulfillment. Take Camel, for example. He began his career with Jazzy in 2006 as a call center advisor, gaining valuable insights from direct customer interactions. He then progressed to a position as a copywriter before transitioning to advertising management, ultimately landing in his current role as a Brand & Communications Director. Camel attributes his success to continuous improvement, a willingness to learn and try new things, and the ability to understand and embrace the vision of his company, Jazzy. He advises his younger self to never give up, learn from mistakes, work on personal growth, and remain open to the perspectives of others.\n\nTo reach your highest potential, you cannot do it alone. Just as hiking through the Hangar Mountains is better with partners, the path to success requires teamwork and collaboration. Camel emphasizes the need to understand teamwork and work effectively with others to achieve your goals. At Jazzy, he is constantly focused on building team spirit, recognizing that reaching the peak of your career goes beyond improving skills and self-confidence.\n\nLanguage plays a significant role in connecting with customers effectively. Camel realized this while managing copywriting campaigns for Jazzy. Algeria is characterized by a unique mix of languages and dialects, including Berber languages and dialects, Kabyle, Chaos, Tuareg, and Arabic. Additionally, French is widely used in commerce, government, and education, with a sprinkling of Spanish influence in the western regions. As a copywriter, the challenge lies in using language that resonates with people in their daily lives. By customizing copy for each region while maintaining a unifying campaign theme, Jazzy successfully connects with individuals in a language they understand and relate to. Data analysis and testing further enhance the effectiveness of their copywriting campaigns. For instance, following interactions on Facebook, Camel discovered that many users preferred Arabic subtitles for French press conferences. As a result, Jazzy adjusted their approach accordingly. To succeed with customers, it is essential to speak their language and carefully consider their preferences and reactions.\n\nAt Jazzy, the company strives to connect with the lives of Algerians through endeavors like sponsoring Master chef Algeria, a show dedicated to the culinary arts. By aligning their brand with Algerian culture and promoting special events like Master chef, Jazzy aims to provide something unique and valuable to their customers. Understanding customer preferences is crucial to satisfaction, just as you wouldn't cook a dish for guests if they despise it. Camel always looks at the data to gain insights into the tastes and preferences of Jazzy's customers. By preparing dishes that cater to their preferences, you can build strong customer relationships and ensure your endeavors are well-received.\n\nEven if you're as efficient as a robot, remember that rest is essential. Just like humans, even robots require sleep in order to function optimally. Allow yourself breaks and take time for activities that bring you joy outside of work. Camel values spending time with his family, enjoying meals together, playing video games like FIFA, and engaging in football matches with friends and his son. Rest and fun are essential ingredients for reaching excellence.\n\nNow that Camel has shared his tips on how to become a champion, it's up to you to take action. Persist in your journey towards success, embracing the value of persistence that Camel instills in his team members. Remember, persistence, culinary art, and football are the keys to reaching your beautiful destination. END"}
{"prompt": "could the flu shot offer protection against covid-19 ? experts say it\u2019s more important than ever that people get the flu vaccine earlier this year , a team of researchers based primarily at johns hopkins university examined county-level health data collected from all 50 states and the district of columbia . the team was looking for associations between last season\u2019s flu vaccine and deaths attributed to covid-19 . after adjusting for more than a dozen variables that could have confused their findings \u2014 such as race , income , education level , health status , and access to hospital care \u2014 the researchers concluded that among adults age 65 and older , a group that accounts for the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths , high rates of vaccine coverage were associated with a significant drop in covid-19 deaths . each 10% increase in flu vaccine coverage within a community corresponded with a 28% reduction in coronavirus deaths , they found . \u201cour findings suggest that influenza vaccination can possibly play a protective role in preventing the worst covid-19 outcomes , \u201d says luigi marchionni , co-author of the paper and an associate professor at johns hopkins medicine . in his team\u2019s paper , which was posted online june 26 and has not yet undergone peer review or formal publication , marchionni and his colleagues were quick to highlight their study\u2019s limitations \u2014 which included a lack of covid-19 reporting consistency among states and localities . but he says that he and his group have since performed additional analyses on the data , and their conclusions have held up . he also references a similar study from brazil , which found evidence that people vaccinated against the flu were less likely than the unvaccinated to suffer from severe or deadly cases of covid-19 . \u201cwe\u2019re most likely going to face a dual pandemic this fall , \u201d he says , referring to the ongoing sars-cov-2 crises and the predictable resurgence of seasonal influenza . \u201cour findings point to some obvious reasons for getting the influenza vaccination . \u201d how the flu vaccine could provide an immune boost marchionni takes pains to explain that his team\u2019s work was observational , meaning they were examining population-level data in an effort to find patterns and associations . they were not assessing individual covid-19 patients in order to identify underlying explanations for their findings . but after delivering that caveat , he says that there\u2019s some evidence that the flu vaccine may trigger one or more immune system changes that may repel the novel coronavirus . \u201cthere is an epitope , meaning a piece of antigen that the immune system can recognize , that is similar between influenza and sars-cov-2 , \u201d he says . it\u2019s possible that the flu vaccine could teach the immune system to be on guard for this antigen , which could provide a coronavirus-blocking benefit . he also says that the flu vaccine could induce a general \u201cboost\u201d to the immune system\u2019s innate defenses , which could help it repel sars-cov-2 . if vaccinated people are generally healthier , then that alone could explain the association between the flu shot and lower rates of covid-19 deaths . there are other possible explanations for the observed association between flu vaccine coverage and reduced covid-19 risk . during the spring , a number of reports documented cases in which people were infected with both the flu and sars-cov-2 at the same time . it\u2019s not yet certain that coinfection with both viruses results in more extreme illness , but experts say that this is possible \u2014 and probably likely . \u201ccoinfection could absolutely make things worse , \u201d says steven pergam , md , an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle . \u201cif someone gets sick from the flu and their immune system is already on high alert and then they get covid-19 on top of that , i worry that could shift them into a really severe covid situation . \u201d the flu vaccine can prevent influenza infections , pergam explains , and it can also reduce the severity of illness among those who become infected with flu . both of these benefits could theoretically reduce the risk of life-threatening illness among those also infected with sars-cov-2 , he says . it\u2019s also possible that someone who contracts the flu and then recovers from it is at greater risk for a bad case of covid-19 due to lingering immune system changes or deficiencies . t-cells are a category of specialized white blood cells that help regulate the immune system . research has shown that , following a case of the flu , people have reduced t-cell diversity and also a greater proportion of influenza-specific t-cells in the lungs . if a person is infected with the novel coronavirus , these t-cell imbalances may lead to the \u201cexaggerated inflammatory response\u201d that is associated with severe covid-19 disease , marchionni says . but others say there could be a simpler explanation for the observed associations between the flu shot and reduced covid-19 risks . \u201cpatients who get the [flu] vaccine are also likely to be more health-conscious [than those who don\u2019t] , \u201d points out michael ison , md , a professor in the division of infectious diseases at northwestern university\u2019s feinberg school of medicine . if vaccinated people are generally healthier , then that alone could explain the association between the flu shot and lower rates of covid-19 deaths , he says . ison says that , for other reasons , it\u2019s important for everyone to get the flu shot this year . but he\u2019s not convinced that the influenza vaccine provides any special covid-19-weakening immune benefits . other vaccines could offer an immune-system boost the influenza vaccine isn\u2019t the only one that researchers believe may offer some coronavirus-related benefits . some are exploring the possibility that active but weakened polio or tuberculosis vaccines could stimulate the immune system in ways that protect people from sars-cov-2 . \u201cwhen you vaccinate people with some of these live attenuated viral vaccines , the immune system produces a number of factors , such as interferons , which have a general antiviral effect , \u201d says paul offit , md , director of the vaccine education center at children\u2019s hospital of philadelphia . offit says that the national institutes of health is exploring the potential benefits of these vaccines , which could theoretically be deployed cheaply and widely among at-risk groups in an effort to block the spread of sars-cov-2 . \u201csome people are pushing for this , but it\u2019s not clear yet whether that will move forward , \u201d he adds . \u201cwhen you vaccinate people with some of these live attenuated viral vaccines , the immune system produces a number of factors , such as interferons , which have a general anti-viral effect . \u201d the importance of getting the flu vaccine while experts say that the coronavirus-weakening power of the flu vaccine is far from proven , they unanimously agree that everyone should get a flu shot this fall . \u201cevery year , the recommendation for the influenza vaccine is for everyone over six months of age to get it , and it\u2019s more important to get it this year than normal , \u201d says offit . why ? during the 2018\u201319 flu season , the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that roughly 36 million americans came down with the flu , which led to more than 16 million health care visits or consultations and 500 , 000 hospitalizations . \u201cif all this happens concurrently with covid-19 , you can see how that would quickly overwhelm the health care system , \u201d offit says . northwestern\u2019s ison reiterates these concerns and says that they underscore the need for people to get the flu shot , which is already available at many nationwide pharmacies . \u201ci think that most individuals should go ahead and get the vaccine as early as possible , \u201d he says . those who are immunocompromised may want to wait until october , he adds , because their body\u2019s protective immune response to the vaccine may not last until the end of the flu season . apart from the flu shot , he says that covid-19-related safety measures like social distancing and masks can also protect people from seasonal respiratory infections like influenza . good compliance with these protocols has led to an unusually mild flu season in countries like australia , where the flu tends to circulate earlier in the year than it does in the u . s . but , due in part to poor adherence to these safety measures , ison says that the u . s . \u201chasn\u2019t done a good job of controlling covid-19 , \u201d and so may be in for a rough flu season . \u201cflu vaccination this year is going to be very important , \u201d he adds .","completion": " Can the flu shot provide

Additionally, the flu vaccine may boost the immune system's innate defenses, potentially aiding in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. It is suggested that reduced COVID-19 risks associated with flu vaccine coverage might be explained by the fact that vaccinated individuals tend to be more health-conscious. However, more research is needed to determine if there are any special COVID-19-weakening immune benefits provided by the influenza vaccine. Researchers are also exploring the possibility of other vaccines, such as weakened polio or tuberculosis vaccines, stimulating the immune system in ways that protect against SARS-CoV-2. Although the flu shot's ability to weaken the coronavirus is not yet proven, experts unanimously agree that the flu vaccine is essential for everyone to get this fall. During the 2018-19 flu season, millions of Americans were affected by the flu, leading to numerous healthcare visits, hospitalizations, and strain on the healthcare system. Given the concurrent existence of COVID-19, it is crucial to prevent the simultaneous occurrence of both viruses overwhelming the healthcare system. Experts stress the importance of individuals receiving the flu shot as early as possible. Immunocompromised individuals may want to wait until October because their protective immune response may not last until the end of the flu season. In addition to the flu shot, adhering to COVID-19 safety measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing can also protect against respiratory infections such as influenza. Countries like Australia, which have seen a milder flu season due to strong adherence to safety measures, serve as an example for the US. However, poor compliance in the US increases the importance of flu vaccination this year. END"}
{"prompt": "by noel hunter an all too common experience of trauma survivors is hearing the suggestion , \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just get over it ? \u201d the idea is that , well , it happened in the past , so it shouldn\u2019t still be affecting you now . it\u2019s as if each moment in life exists in a vacuum , separate and untouched by anything that happened prior to this moment . the thing is , everything that\u2019s happening right now is impacted by everything that has preceded it . our brain filters each perception through a lens of past experience , it predicts the next moment based on past experience , and it reacts with primitive automatic reactions that are-you guessed it-based on past experience . obviously , then , our past experiences influence everything in our current life . of course , not everyone who has survived trauma in their life will continue to be haunted and controlled by it . many can and do heal , going on to live content and successful lives with the past nothing more than a fading scar . at the same time , many others continue to struggle in various ways . many mental health systems push for positive , trauma-informed practices and awareness . unfortunately , their policies are typically based in re-traumatizing narratives and reinforcement of trauma-based self-perceptions . the following are some ways in which trauma commonly impacts a trauma survivor\u2019s life . imagine , as you read through , how different our society might be if systems of care and justice were as trauma-informed as your life might be\u2026 sense of self war , violence , sexual assault , physical and emotional abuse , physical and emotional neglect , chronic invalidation , chronic racism , chronic oppression , poverty-these things profoundly shape and/or re-shape how people view themselves . if you\u2019ve been ignored , gaslit , blamed , or chronically invalidated , you\u2019re probably going to pretty quickly get the idea that you don\u2019t matter . worthlessness , feeling invisible , constantly doubting yourself , and feeling two inches tall become a way of life . being violated , assaulted , or even assaulting another creates such a fundamental sense of shame deep within one\u2019s soul that it festers like hidden mold behind a layer of glossy paint . feelings of defectiveness and self-hatred appear reasonable and can be taken as objective fact . if you\u2019ve been told your whole life that you\u2019re a piece of shit , guess what ? you\u2019re probably going to believe that you\u2019re a piece of shit . you don\u2019t just snap out of these kinds of thinking simply because you get older . and , you definitely don\u2019t stop thinking this way just because someone tells you to get over it . relationships our sense of self directly impacts how we interact with others . self-hatred and feelings of inferiority and worthlessness make it pretty difficult to make small talk or engage in light-hearted verse . not to mention that these feelings get projected onto others-we love to assume that everyone thinks just like us . if you look at yourself with disdain and fury , you\u2019re pretty likely to assume everyone\u2019s looking at you like that . and , who wants to engage with someone who thinks you\u2019re defective and awful ? we are taught from our first breath how to interact with those around us and what to expect from others . if those people to whom you are closest hurt you , then you learn that everyone will hurt you . despite \u201cknowing\u201d that it\u2019s inevitable , you will likely spend a great deal of energy trying your darndest to stop that hurt from happening never really allowing yourself to just be with another . it is fairly common for those who have experienced interpersonal trauma , specifically , to view people through the lens of the \u201c drama triangle . \u201d this trauma lens perceives all humans to play one of three roles the perpetrator , the victim , or the rescuer . the thing is , these roles are ever-shifting . anyone individual will be perceived as taking on one of these roles at any given time\u2026 including oneself . when people are perceived as always playing a role of a savior , someone to feel sorry for , or a monster , it becomes really difficult to actually see the person before you ( or yourself ! ) for who they really are . worse , someone always has to be a monster . the fear and anger never end . parenting we all know that trauma tends to repeat itself across generations . perhaps there\u2019s some epigenetic piece to this , but there is no doubt as to the role of direct trauma and stress as well . if you ( or those closest to you ) are always a potential monster , this sets up an extremely precarious situation in which to bring up a helpless and totally dependent baby . you fear becoming the monster and so might become passive or over-protective . or , perhaps you do become the monster and repeat the cycle of abuse . worse , you might start to perceive the child to be the monster . often , parents whose needs were never met as a child will look to their own children to get their needs met . this sets up a cycle of parentification , lack of attunement , and emotional neglect . this is the cycle of trauma that stays hidden behind layers of enmeshed love and toxic interdependence . parenting is hard when you\u2019ve never had a healthy parent to learn from . career trauma is a tricky devil . there is no singular path away from pain what for one person might be a life of self-sabotage and expected failures is , for another , a life of over-achievement and incredible success . what is shared underneath these seemingly opposite paths is a fundamental sense of inferiority . for the person who struggles to get ahead and/or to keep a job there are a plethora of merging factors that can cause this . perhaps academic capabilities have been stunted by severe neglect . intense stress and emotional overwhelm makes it nearly impossible for many to focus on silly things like algebra or charles dickens . if you\u2019re the sort to act out your pain , from the get-go you might be labeled a troublemaker and have others instill repeated messages of your hopeless future . authority figures are frequently seen as dangerous and hypocritical if you can\u2019t get along with authority , you\u2019re not likely to do so well in school or job . worse , when in chronic survival mode , the future is bleak-if it\u2019s possible to believe in its existence at all . and , so , going to college or saving for what\u2019s ahead just seems , frankly , dumb . let\u2019s not forget , of course , that having a mental health diagnosis , especially the more severe ones that are themselves directly associated with trauma , leads to prejudiced hiring and discrimination in the workplace . on the other hand , hyperfocusing on academics and/or a job might become itself a coping tool to escape the horrors of home/community/peers , etc . feelings of inferiority might fuel a never-ending effort to prove yourself . life might become motivated solely or largely by fleeting moments of praise and accolades . whichever divergent path you might find yourself on , it\u2019s an exhausting one that rarely is fulfilling and often reinforces that gnawing sense of emptiness and self-hatred . freedom if you\u2019re controlled by the past , it\u2019s hard to feel free regardless of your external circumstances . it also exponentially increases your odds of losing your external freedom as well . increased traumatic experiences directly relate to increased chances of jail , hospitalization , addiction , chronic psychosis , aot orders , guardianships , and severe health issues . if you\u2019re trapped by the past , you\u2019re very likely to be trapped , literally , in the present . experiencing chronic and multiple traumatic events drastically increases the odds that someone will be arrested and incarcerated . almost half of all women in jail and a third of men have a lifetime history of ptsd . and that\u2019s just including overt , dsm-defined traumatic experiences . add in racism , oppression , emotional abuse , and emotional neglect and i would venture to guess that the prevalence approaches 100% . being locked up in a psychiatric hospital is inherently associated with past trauma . one study showed that 91% of admitted patients report overt trauma , with 69% reporting repeated , chronic trauma . another found that almost 100% report overt trauma . not to mention how common it is for people to be directly traumatized by the treatment experience itself . the homeless population consists nearly entirely of trauma survivors , particularly childhood trauma . and once homeless , it is common to be trapped in a cycle of housing problems , jailtime for minor infractions , and being sent to the psych ward . physical health it shouldn\u2019t be that surprising that chronic stress and trauma would leave your body in a toxic state . traumatic experiences have been shown repeatedly to be directly associated with autoimmune disease , heart disease , stroke , cancer , diabetes , obesity , adolescent obesity , drug and alcohol abuse , and alzheimer\u2019s . and when you consider all of the above , you can see how quickly things compound . if you\u2019re lonely and filled with hate for yourself , you\u2019re not likely to be so interested in healthy eating . conversely , you might become obsessed with some factor of your body like , say , weight , and starve or purge or excessively exercise to make up for your perceived defectiveness . if you aren\u2019t making money , you can\u2019t even afford to eat healthy or go to some fancy gym . if you live in the united states , you\u2019ll also likely have terrible healthcare , if you have it at all . the meals in locked facilities are about as healthy as what is fed to lab rats to keep them merely alive . the drugs given and/or forced in these places not only can result in obesity , digestive issues , brain damage , and blood problems , they also can make a person numb , hyperactive and/or shut down , and agitated , leading to its own cascade of health issues . if you\u2019re addicted to street drugs , alcohol , food , and/or risky lifestyles , health declines fairly rapidly . even if you are relatively healthy , trauma can be felt in the body through chronic pain , pseudoseizures , unexplained pain , digestive issues , memory problems , numbness , clumsiness , tight muscles , headaches , teeth erosion and jaw pain , and breathing issues . any one of these can itself directly lead to more severe injury or health issues over time . having a diagnosis , history of hospitalization , and/or history of incarceration directly results in discrimination by healthcare workers . so , even if you\u2019re fortunate to have access to decent healthcare , you\u2019re still not likely to receive it . trauma and all of the additive effects of the sequelae of trauma understandably may lead to suicidality , self-harm , and passive suicidal behaviors . is it that surprising , then , that those with a significant trauma history have a lifespan decreased by 20 years ? imagine if our systems of care and our governments understood this . imagine if they developed programs around these ideas . imagine if all the money spent on finding the genetic roots of everything mentioned here , or on pharmaceutical interventions , was instead spent on helping people heal from

.","completion": " By Noel Hunter\n\nAn all too common experience of trauma survivors is hearing the suggestion, \"Why don't you just get over it?\" The idea is that because it happened in the past, it shouldn't still be affecting you now. However, every moment in life is influenced by everything that has preceded it. Our brain filters each perception through the lens of experience, predicts the next moment based on experience, and reacts with automatic responses based on experience. Our experiences inevitably shape everything in our current life.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that not everyone who has survived trauma will continue to be haunted and controlled by it. Many individuals can and do heal, going on to live content and successful lives with the past nothing more than a fading scar. Unfortunately, many others continue to struggle in various ways.\n\nMany mental health systems advocate for positive, trauma-informed practices and awareness. However, their policies often rely on re-traumatizing narratives and reinforce trauma-based self-perceptions. The following are some ways in which trauma commonly impacts a survivor's life. Reflect on how different our society might be if systems of care and justice were as trauma-informed as they could be.\n\nSense of Self:\nWar, violence, sexual assault, abuse, neglect, chronic invalidation, racism, oppression, and poverty profoundly shape how individuals view themselves. Being ignored, gas lit, blamed, or chronically invalidated leads to feelings of worthlessness, invisibility, self-doubt, and self-hatred. Traumatic experiences create deep-seated shame and a sense of defectiveness. If one is consistently told they are a piece of garbage, they will likely internalize that belief. These thought patterns do not simply fade away with age or disappear due to someone telling them to get over it.\n\nRelationships:\nOur sense of self directly impacts how we interact with others. Self-hatred and feelings of inferiority make it difficult to engage in light-hearted conversation and connect with others. These negative self-perceptions often project onto others, assuming that everyone sees us in the same negative light. Our early experiences shape how we interact with people and what we expect from them. If those closest to us have hurt us, we learn to anticipate hurt from everyone. Consequently, we may expend great effort to prevent that hurt from happening, preventing ourselves from truly connecting with others. Trauma can also lead individuals to view people through a lens of roles, such as perpetrator, victim, or rescuer. This makes it challenging to see the true essence of a person, including oneself, as fear and anger persist.\n\nParenting:\nTrauma tends to repeat itself across generations, creating a precarious environment to raise a vulnerable and dependent child. The fear of becoming a monster may cause parents to become passive or overprotective, while some may end up repeating the cycle of abuse. In some cases, the child is perceived to be the monster. Parents who didn't receive proper care as children may look to their own children to meet their needs, perpetuating identification, lack of attunement, and emotional neglect. Parenting is challenging when one has never had a healthy parent as a role model.\n\nCareer:\nTrauma can manifest in various ways in one's career. Some may struggle to get ahead and maintain employment due to factors such as stunted academic development or emotional overwhelm that impairs focus. Those who act out due to pain may be labeled as troublemakers, reinforcing messages of hopelessness. Difficulties with authority often hinder success in academic and professional settings. Conversely, some individuals hyperfocus on academics or work as a coping mechanism to escape their traumatic experiences. Regardless of the path one takes, feelings of inferiority can be exhausting and reinforce emptiness and self-hatred.\n\nFreedom:\nIf one is controlled by the past, it is difficult to feel free in any circumstance. Additionally, the likelihood of losing external freedom increases. Traumatic experiences are directly linked to increased chances of incarceration, hospitalization, addiction, chronic psychosis, court-ordered treatment, guardianship, and severe health issues. Chronic and multiple traumatic events increase the probability of arrest and incarceration. A significant percentage of individuals in jail have a lifetime history of PTSD, which becomes even more prevalent when considering racism, oppression, emotional abuse, and neglect. Homelessness is also prevalent among trauma survivors, especially those who have experienced childhood trauma. Once homeless, individuals often remain trapped in a cycle of housing instability, minor offenses leading to jail time, and psychiatric hospitalization.\n\nPhysical Health:\nChronic stress and trauma have a detrimental impact on physical health. Traumatic experiences are repeatedly associated with autoimmune diseases, heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity, drug and alcohol abuse, and Alzheimer's. The compounded effects of trauma contribute to unhealthy habits such as poor nutrition, unhealthy body image, and limited access to healthcare. Additionally, trauma can manifest in chronic pain, pseudoseizures, unexplained pain, digestive issues, memory problems, numbness, clumsiness, tight muscles, headaches, teeth erosion, jaw pain, and breathing issues. These physical symptoms can lead to further injury or health problems over time. Those with a history of hospitalization, incarceration, or mental health diagnoses often face discrimination within the healthcare system, further limiting access to adequate care.\n\nThe cumulative effects of trauma often lead to feelings of suicidality, self-harm, and passive suicidal behaviors. It is unsurprising that individuals with a significant trauma history have a decreased lifespan of 20 years. Imagine a society where our systems of care and government understood these profound impacts and developed programs and policies based on this understanding. Imagine if the funds invested in genetic research and pharmaceutical interventions were directed towards helping people heal from trauma. Better yet, imagine a society that aimed to be less traumatic, with more equality, compassion, social services, accessible healthcare, trauma-informed healing modalities, greater protection for children, rehabilitative responses instead of punitive measures, relaxation, love, and connection.

The UN attributes this positive development to the ban on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) implemented in the 1980s. This ban has resulted in a gradual healing of the ozone layer at a rate of 3% per decade. While this news brings a glimmer of hope amidst the concerning state of our planet, it is crucial to acknowledge that there is still plenty of work to be done in order to restore and protect our home's well-being.\n\nCFCs are organic compounds composed of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine. They were commonly used in the manufacturing of solvents, refrigerants, aerosol sprays, and blowing agents in packing materials since the 1930s. Initially considered a safe and non-toxic alternative to other hazardous substances like ammonia, the introduction of CFCs had severe consequences for the planet. The chlorine emitted into the atmosphere had the potential to cause significant damage to the ozone layer, as observed particularly over Antarctica.\n\nFortunately, the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed by over 197 nations, has played a pivotal role in banning ozone-depleting substances such as CFCs. Combined with advancements in technology, we are witnessing a gradual recovery of the ozone layer. According to the UN report, the upper layer of ozone over the Northern Hemisphere is expected to be fully repaired by 2030, while the damage over the Southern Hemisphere will return to normal by the middle of this century. The healing of the ozone layer is vital for the survival of our planet and the well-being of the human race, as it plays a crucial role in absorbing most of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation.\n\nDespite these promising developments, it is disheartening to note that certain regions continue to contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer through illegal CFC emissions. The UN report highlights an unexpected and unidentified increase in CFC-11 emissions from Eastern Asia since 2012. Earlier investigations by The Guardian traced some of these illegal emissions back to the Chinese plastic foam industry. If left unchecked, these emissions could potentially delay the recovery of the ozone layer by up to 20 years, as reported by Sky News.\n\nFurthermore, there has been a concerning trend of pollutant industries moving to Eastern countries, which contributes to their high levels of CO2 emissions. Combining the damaging effects of CFCs and greenhouse gases is a significant obstacle to achieving sustainability and the recovery of our planet. To address this issue, it is essential for production and manufacturing industries, businesses, and individuals in Eastern Asia and globally to adopt more energy-efficient and environmentally conscious practices.\n\nHuman behavior is often habitual and requires repeated and tangible incentives to induce change. Energitoken, supported by various energy-efficient partners, offers individuals a solution in this regard. Energitoken is a rewards' platform predominantly present in Europe and Asia that grants energy efficiency rewards in the form of Energitokens (ETC), a tangible cryptocurrency that can be utilized within their ecosystem of approved vendors. When individuals demonstrate acts that contribute to reducing energy consumption, such as purchasing energy-efficient appliances or opting for low-carbon transportation, they receive a sum of ETC that can be spent accordingly.\n\nRecent partners of Energitoken include Solis co, Next bike, and the Korean-based Hotel Cappuccino. Hotel Cappuccino, an urban lifestyle hotel, is actively tackling the issue of energy overconsumption by encouraging guests to adopt efficient practices, such as reusing towels. Guests who partake in these behaviors receive rewards in the form of angel coupons, which can be utilized within the hotel caf\u00e9 or directed as a donation to a charity. Through its partnership with Energizing, Hotel Cappuccino has now integrated the Energitoken rewards platform, allowing them to further incentivize their energy-conscious guests with ETC that can be spent beyond the confines of the hotel itself. By motivating more people to adopt energy-efficient behaviors, rewards systems like this can help make eco-friendly and energy-reductive actions habitual, ultimately contributing toward the creation of a sustainable planet where green choices become the norm.\n\nTogether, we have the power to shape the future of our planet and nurse it back to health.

These misconceptions have been perpetuated since the ancient days of the Olympics, through the boom of jogging in the 1970s, and into the present day. As a dedicated runner for over two decades, I have come across these myths time and time again, only to find them debunked. Let's separate fact from fiction and shed some light on the truth about running.\n\nMyth #1: Running will ruin your knees\n\nThis is a fallacy that many runners encounter regularly. Contrary to popular belief, running does not cause damage to your knees. In fact, it has been proven that running can actually be beneficial to the cartilage in your knee joints. Additionally, running helps maintain a healthy weight, which relieves unnecessary strain on your joints.\n\nMyth #2: Stretching before running is essential\n\nThe idea of static stretching before a run has been deeply ingrained in our minds, but research tells us otherwise. Static stretching before a run is not beneficial and may even hinder your performance. Instead, opt for a short warm-up and incorporate dynamic stretches to properly prepare your body for the activity ahead.\n\nMyth #3: Pasta is a pre-race dinner necessity\n\nThe notion of auto-loading before a big race has lost its popularity in recent years. Consuming a large bowl of pasta the night before a race can leave you feeling bloated and uncomfortable the next day. Instead, focus on gradually increasing your carbohydrate intake in the days leading up to the race, incorporating healthy and complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, black beans, and lentils.\n\nMyth #4: Real runners don't walk\n\nThis misconception needs to be debunked once and for all. Walking is a legitimate and effective technique for runners, as popular running coach Jeff Galloway incorporates it into his training programs. Embrace the concept of run-walk intervals, as they can enhance your overall performance and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nMyth #5: Runners can eat anything without consequences\n\nIt would be wonderful if this myth held true, but unfortunately, it does not. While running may increase your caloric expenditure, it does not give you a free pass to indulge in any and every food craving. It is important for runners to maintain a balanced diet and be mindful of their calorie intake. Even if you run 20 miles in a day, consuming more calories than you burn will result in weight gain.\n\n5 Undeniable Facts About Running\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to the undeniable benefits and truths about running that should be celebrated.\n\nFact #1: Running can significantly boost your mood\n\nExercise, including running, has been proven to reduce stress and enhance one's ability to manage anxiety. The release of norepinephrine, a chemical in the brain responsible for stress management, is increased during exercise. Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals who engage in regular exercise are not only less likely to be depressed but also exhibit higher levels of emotional well-being.\n\nFact #2: Running strengthens your bones\n\nRunning is a weight-bearing exercise that not only slows down bone loss but also stimulates bone growth. Recent studies have even suggested that running can build bones, improving overall bone density and strength.\n\nFact #3: Running enhances longevity\n\nA comprehensive analysis of multiple studies concluded that compared to non-runners, those who regularly engage in running were 27% less likely to die during the study period. This research supports the notion that running contributes to overall health and longevity.\n\nFact #4: Running promotes better sleep quality\n\nRegular exercise, including running, can significantly improve the quality of your sleep. Deep sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep, is essential for rejuvenation and restoration. Studies conducted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Sleep have discovered that individuals who engage in exercise for more than 30 minutes per day experience enhanced sleep quality. However, it is advisable to be mindful of the timing of your runs, as exercising too close to bedtime may interfere with falling asleep.\n\nFact #5: Regularly update your running shoes\n\nWhile running requires minimal equipment, the significance of proper running shoes cannot be overstated. Shoes that have worn down can lead to injuries and discomfort. It is crucial to keep track of the mileage you put on your shoes, using apps or other methods to monitor wear and tear. Signs such as pain during running, worn-out treads, and decreased shock absorption indicate that it is time for a new pair of shoes.\n\nIn conclusion, it is imperative that we dispel the myths surrounding running and embrace the undeniable truths that have been supported by scientific research. By understanding the realities of running, we can optimize our training, maintain our physical well-being, and enjoy the countless benefits this timeless sport has to offer. END"}

they\u2019ve been given this funding , and they can just go forth and disrupt publishing , and i wanted to try that . it seemed like the version of tech that was related to my interests , which at the time were pretty much books and tumblr . so that was how i got my start in tech . that job was also a contract position . \u201c[in the article , there] was just this picture of these three men . they looked so happy , and i was like , \u2018yeah , i guess i would also be happy if i had $3 million to make something . \u2019\u201d once you arrived in silicon valley , it seems as if some of the broader structural cultural issues become apparent pretty quickly . anna , there\u2019s a great line in your book about how it became clear that so much of the tech culture is built by young white men from \u201cthe soft suburbs . \u201d and then that is being exported . anna wiener well , one might say that a lot of american society is run by young white men from american suburbs , so it wasn\u2019t like a total fish-out-of-water situation . when i started at my first company in silicon valley , it was almost entirely young men . anna wiener . i think this manifests in different ways you have people who are quite young and who are quite inexperienced \u2014 professionally and also in life . they\u2019re learning how to manage other people \u2014 some of whom are older than they are and have more experience \u2014 at the same time that they are figuring out how to scale , how to grow , how to be a professional , how to be independent in their twenties . you end up with these cultures that , with that youthfulness combined with certain industry values , tend to lean toward the irreverent \u2014 this idea that this is like an anti-authority , anti-government , anti-bureaucratic form of business . when those two things collide , you get a workplace culture that can be quite alienating to someone who is on the outside in any way . i think you also just get a workplace culture that\u2019s governed by the sort of business advice one might read on medium from a semi-experienced venture capitalist . onezero and that often results in what jessica details in her book \u2014 institutional sexism . in jessica\u2019s book , it\u2019s very explicit the engineers are building internal hookup apps to keep the engineers happy . the message is pretty clear that the company culture in a lot of these places is serving a very narrow interest , which is the interest of the men working there . jessica , can you talk about what in your experience inside silicon valley led you to register that critique ? jessica powell everyone thinks i wrote the book when i was at google . i was at google for a long time . then i went to a startup in london and then went back to google . this startup was pretty horrific . like one time i came in and there were , like , dildos on my desk . not like dildos . there were dildos on my desk . when i started writing , i had no idea it was gonna be a book . i was just writing because i was mad , but i didn\u2019t even know if i had the right to be mad . on the one hand , it seemed so obvious that what was happening around me was bad . but no one seemed to care . that\u2019s probably not true . i think probably people did care . but when something becomes normalized , you really doubt yourself . whenever i would raise some of these issues , people would be like , \u201coh , don\u2019t freak out about it , \u201d \u2014 i\u2019d be the only woman on the management team \u2014 and , \u201coh , but you just care about that because you\u2019re a woman . \u201d maybe . generally in the valley , we really have bought into this idea of it being a meritocracy . and certainly if i think of my own career , going into google at 26 and , you know , running my department by the time i was , i think , 37 or 36 , i don\u2019t think that would have actually happened in any other industry . if you were there to catch the ball , and you could catch it , then you kind of continued to advance . so , i do think there is something really special about the silicon valley culture in that sense . but it\u2019s a total myth that it\u2019s a meritocracy . the problem is that we think of our platforms as neutral . we think of our company structures as neutral , and we don\u2019t always look at the inequalities that exist within them . at google , we had a tgif [meeting]\u2026 where you have the q&a and the founders get up and they\u2019ll answer any question , which is great . that does not happen in every industry . but we would assume that because we put the mic in the room , that meant everyone had equal access to the mic . but that\u2019s not how it works . guess what happens ? who are the majority of people who go to the mic ? it\u2019s a bunch of men , primarily white men . they should absolutely have the right to ask those questions . there\u2019s nothing wrong with them , but we\u2019re wrong to assume that tech is neutral . and i think that is how a lot of the sexism and racism and ageism \u2014 we never talk about ageism , but my god ageism ! \u2014 i think that\u2019s how that all happens . we keep thinking we\u2019re all wonderful , fair people , and so we don\u2019t interrogate enough how our tools and how our structures in the company are used . onezero you both explicitly said that you hope your work has a political element , that you hope it engenders change . what would that look like ? anna wiener i think [tech] is an industry that\u2019s quite hostile to criticism \u2014 not just [an industry that] doesn\u2019t want to think about any critique , but is actively dismissive of criticism . i think criticism is inherently political , especially when you\u2019re criticizing power . and i do hope my book is politically useful in the sense that i want people to see how people speak and how they think and what the intellectual figureheads are in a culture that has amassed such a high concentration of wealth and power so quickly . my reason for writing the book as memoir was i felt that\u2014especially as a nontechnical woman with the story i had\u2014if i had disguised it as fiction , it would not be taken seriously . i wanted people to understand that these things all happen , the good and the bad , that my experience here was as fortuitous as it was disenchanting . [by not naming companies or executives in the book , ] my point was that this is more about people or institutions in a structural position , and the behavior is what\u2019s important \u2014 not any particular company . people have come to me since the book\u2019s come out and asked , \u201cdid you work at x analytics company ? \u201d and i did not . onezero because their experiences so mirrored what they saw at their workplace ? anna wiener a concrete example there\u2019s a part in the book where i talk about my team being brought into a conference room and our manager asking us to write down the names of the five smartest people we knew . we all wrote down our friends\u2019 names , and then he was like , \u201cwhy don\u2019t they work here ? \u201d a woman i know emailed me after reading this , and she was like , \u201cthe same exact thing happened at a company that i worked for in a totally different part of the industry \u2014 they must have just read it on the same blog post . \u201d i just feel like there are these cultural ticks \u2014 i want to point out that this is not hyperspecific . onezero jessica , what\u2019s been the response to your book as a piece of satire ? if you\u2019re reading between the lines , some people may or may not be super favorably rendered in there . jessica powell yeah , there\u2019s no one-for-one matching . everyone has an opinion about the [character of the] nymphomaniac ceo . they all have guesses , which are actually super-good guesses . but the biggest inspiration [for this book] was definitely working at that startup . i don\u2019t think the head of that startup liked the book . in fact , there was a huge expos\u00e9 of him last summer , about all the misogyny and racism at their headquarters . i gave a quote for the article , and his response was , \u201cjessica\u2019s just trying to promote her book , along with all the other people who had spoken out . \u201d and i was just like , no one even cares about your company . if i was going to promote my book , i think i\u2019d talk about google\u2019s sexism . jessica powell . as for google , the people i consider my friends have all been great . there were a ton of google employees who reached out and were just like , \u201cwow , i feel like you\u2019re making us eat our vegetables , and we\u2019re talking a lot about it . \u201d that is super rewarding to hear . there were definitely some people who were not happy about it , who all of a sudden stopped talking to me . and that hurt , definitely , in the first beat of it . and then i had a moment where i was like , wait a second , so we are not friends because i criticized the industry you worked in ? that\u2019s way more dystopian than anything i wrote in that book . anna wiener jess , i\u2019m curious if you\u2019re worried about credibility . as a fairly low-level employee at these companies , i worried about people dismissing my account because i\u2019d only worked in the industry for five years . i wasn\u2019t even a programmer . i wasn\u2019t super ambitious in my career after a certain point . did the question of credibility come up for you as someone who had worked in the industry for a much longer period and had become an executive ? was that on your mind at all ? jessica powell people like to position critics as outsiders trying to undermine the credibility of [the industry] . and even more so if you\u2019re not technical . then they can kind of , you know , bucket you as , \u201ceh , they don\u2019t really understand the tech . \u201d \u201cthe problem is that we think of our platforms as neutral . we think of our company structures as neutral , and we don\u2019t always look at the inequalities that exist within them . \u201d onezero in 2014 , the founder of github stepped down after serious sexual harassment allegations led to a companywide probe of the startup\u2019s culture . anna , when you joined the company , it had adopted a number of measures to try to make structural changes , to deter harassment and promote inclusion . you detail some of the ways those were and weren\u2019t successful . what do you think of such efforts put forward by the industry so far ? anna wiener we have to look at these as structural issues . we have to look at the incentives of the industry , the incentives of the business model , the incentives of venture capital . i think there\u2019s a lot of really important work being done at a lot of startups and larger corporations with diversity and inclusion . i think there are people working really , really hard to change cultures internally . but i think until those people are really given a seat at the table , really given power internally , we\u2019re unlikely to see any sort of meaningful cultural shift . unless you see a shift in the business model or in these incentives , we\u2019re unlikely to see a shift in the way the products are used . i\u2019m not saying we should dismantle capitalism , exactly , but i do think these problems can\u2019t be solved at the company level , because it\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s interest to do so . until we can really acknowledge that and reckon with that , we\u2019re unlikely to see meaningful shifts . i can\u2019t speak to what happened at github . i wasn\u2019t in the room for important meetings , but my understanding of the work people were doing around diversity and inclusion is that [it] was going to take time , and it was going to require people to slow down . it\u2019s going to require certain changes to the product itself . and that\u2019s not in the interest of the company that is gunning for an ipo or for a multibillion-dollar acquisition by microsoft . i think there are things we haven\u2019t tried yet , which makes me really excited . some of the recent organizing we\u2019re seeing in tech is really compelling . i think employees having a seat at the table or employees on the board , that\u2019s a step in an interesting direction \u2014 collective ownership . for an industry that has so many smart people and so many optimistic , idealistic people , we haven\u2019t been super imaginative . jessica powell i\u2019d like to see more engagement from tech with the outside world . [anna was] saying earlier that it\u2019s an industry that does not take kindly to criticism . i think that\u2019s very , very much true . and so what happens is , say facebook does something dumb or controversial on the content moderation side , and everyone gets all worked up . what happens if you are at reddit , youtube , twitter , any kind of ugc platform ? you totally close ranks . you don\u2019t say a thing . you don\u2019t want to get pulled into that , on a policy side , on a press side . so you don\u2019t say anything . and so then you have this vacuum of largely reporters or politicians weighing in on these debates . you get this vacuum and anti-tech vitriol . [it\u2019s] not always super informed . but it\u2019s a problem of our own making , because we don\u2019t do anything . we keep our heads below the parapet . and so i think we kind of deserve it . on twitter , i\u2019ve got my media feed and i\u2019ve got my tech feed . it\u2019s very funny to watch them sometimes . all the tech people are like , \u201coh , the media . it\u2019s all fake news and they hate us and so they make things up . \u201d and yeah , sometimes it\u2019s a little extreme , but it\u2019s also because we don\u2019t do a whole lot . there\u2019s so much anti-tech sentiment . everyone just kept on trying to put me into this hole of , like , \u201cyou\u2019re this whistleblower , you hate tech , da , da , da , da . \u201d the thing is , i don\u2019t . i still work in tech . i think it\u2019s something that\u2019s really , really special \u2014 the questioning of assumptions and trying to do stuff even if you don\u2019t know that you can do it . i love that there are people trying and failing . [but] can we all just behave better , please ? update this article has been updated to clarify jessica powell\u2019s role at google .","completion": " Let's discuss the experiences of Jessica Powell and Anna Wiener as they first entered the tech industry in Silicon Valley. Jessica Powell initially had no interest in tech but found herself in London without a visa or job opportunities. She applied for various jobs, including at Google, where she eventually got hired as a contractor. Anna Wiener, on the other hand, was working as an assistant at a literary agency and stumbled upon an article about a startup in the tech industry that intrigued her. She saw it as an opportunity to combine her interests in books and technology.\n\nUpon their arrival in Silicon Valley, both Jessica and Anna noticed some structural and cultural issues within the tech industry. Anna pointed out that the tech culture was predominantly built by young white men from privileged backgrounds and that this culture was exported to other parts of society as well. The industry was filled with young and inexperienced professionals who were learning how to manage others while also trying to scale and grow their businesses. This combination of youthfulness and certain industry values often resulted in a workplace culture that was alienating and irreverent to those outside of it.\n\nJessica noted that tech companies often claimed to be meritocracies, but the reality was quite different. While she acknowledged the opportunities for advancement based on skill and performance in the industry, she also recognized the inequalities and biases that existed within tech platforms and company structures. She mentioned how platforms and structures that are perceived as neutral can actually perpetuate sexism, racism, and ageism.\n\nBoth Jessica and Anna expressed their desire for their work to have a political impact and bring about change. Anna hoped that her book would shed light on the intellectual figures and cultural dynamics within the industry. Jessica, on the other hand, admitted that writing her book was driven by her frustration with the normalization of problematic behaviors in the tech industry. She wanted to challenge the myth of the industry being a meritocracy and encourage people to scrutinize the inequalities within tech platforms and structures.\n\nRegarding criticism of their work, Jessica mentioned that some people were unhappy with her book, particularly those working in the industry she criticized. However, she also received positive feedback from Google employees who appreciated the discussions her book had sparked. Anna raised concerns about credibility as a relatively low-level employee in the industry. Jessica, as someone who had worked in tech for a longer period and reached an executive position, acknowledged that critics are often seen as outsiders attempting to undermine the industry's credibility.\n\nThe discussion then moved to efforts made by the tech industry to address issues such as sexual harassment and promote inclusion. Anna highlighted the need to address the structural issues and incentives within the industry. She believed that until diverse voices were given real power and until there was a shift in business models and incentives, meaningful cultural changes would be difficult to achieve. Anna also emphasized the importance of employees having a seat at the table and collective ownership as potential steps toward meaningful change.\n\nJessica expressed her desire for the tech industry to engage more with the outside world and be open to criticism. She believed that the industry's reluctance to address issues has created a vacuum filled with anti-tech sentiment. This sentiment is often fueled by uninformed opinions and can be avoided if the industry takes a proactive approach in addressing its own shortcomings.\n\nOverall, both Jessica and Anna acknowledged the potential of the tech industry while highlighting the need for improvement and a more inclusive, accountable, and self-reflective culture within it.

Those who entered the mining sector early on managed to accumulate substantial wealth in a short period. Initially, a basic home computer sufficed for individuals to earn a Bitcoin. However, as more individuals joined the mining community, the energy requirements escalated. Presently, an extensive amount of energy is necessary to power the computers vital for solving the algorithms essential for receiving rewards. Unfortunately, the costs associated with setting up and operating a mining operation have now become unprofitable. \n\nRunning a mining computer, such as the ant miner s9 (which costs $8,200), constantly for an entire year consumes approximately 15,000 kilowatt-hours and generates around 0.85 bitcoins annually. Consequently, the energy costs for mining a single bitcoin vary between $3,200 (in Louisiana) and $9,400 (in Hawaii\u2019i). It is imperative that sustainability and environmental impact are given priority. While it is unlikely that all the world's energy will be consumed by 2020 due to bitcoin mining, it is evident that this practice is becoming increasingly harmful to the environment. In China, where much of the mining occurs, fossil fuels are utilized to power operations, leading to further damage to the local ecosystem.\n\nFortunately, on the Genaro network, mining does not have such detrimental effects on the environment. Mining on the Genaro network can be performed using a home computer since miners share hard drive space rather than consuming exorbitant amounts of energy. Genaro Eden, the first decentralized application (Damp) on the Genaro network, enables users to securely store their data on Genaro's public blockchain. The data is encrypted and dispersed across the network, stored on different nodes. An advantage of being an Eden user is that as the user base expands, the costs of storing data decrease.\n\nGenaro Sharer allows users to earn rewards by sharing their hard drive space, creating a global, sustainable ecosystem. The Genaro network ensures that data is stored on the nearest node, guaranteeing efficient accessibility. Sharer is sustainable since it optimizes unused hard drive space, benefiting both parties involved. Unused space no longer remains idle; instead, it can store others' data while enabling \"sharers\" to earn rewards. By selling unused space, Genaro Eden makes storage more economical and environmentally friendly, promoting the optimal allocation of resources. This concept is known as \"green computing.\"\n\nThe Genaro network recognizes the importance of environmental responsibility and is committed to pursuing sustainable solutions. By eliminating the damaging environmental impact associated with traditional cryptocurrency mining, the Genaro network has created an ecosystem that benefits data storage and sharing while optimizing hard disk space, which is often underutilized.

Originally introduced in 2011, this iconic vehicle has captured the attention of automobile enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nHowever, my focus today is not solely on the Lamborghini Aventador itself, but rather on the personal journey of self-discovery and reflection that the narrating individual has embarked upon. After realizing that material possessions and external achievements do not necessarily equate to happiness, they have made a conscious decision to embrace a more tranquil and contented state of being.\n\nIn order to achieve this newfound state of tranquility, the individual has made notable lifestyle changes. They have let go of their previous memberships to clubs and organizations, sold their stocks, and even ended their participation in the lottery. Moreover, they discarded motivational books that once adorned their shelves, recognizing that true fulfillment cannot be attained through external sources of inspiration alone.\n\nIn the pursuit of contentment, the individual emphasizes the value of making an effort and trying one's best. They believe that it is preferable to attempt and fall short rather than perpetually wonder about the outcome had they not even tried. This sentiment, eloquently expressed by Alfred Lord Tennyson, resonates deeply with their perspective on life.\n\nIt is essential to note that this journey towards tranquility did not unfold overnight. The individual acknowledges that striving for greatness requires more than just determination and perseverance. They emphasize the importance of foresight, understanding the desires and needs of others, and possessing astute business acumen to transform ideas into reality. While they might personally identify with those who did not succeed in their entrepreneurial endeavors, they find solace in knowing that they made a genuine effort.\n\nBy relinquishing their pursuit of success, the narrator has gained immeasurable benefits. This includes financial relief and, significantly, a reduction in the enormous amount of stress that was adversely affecting their well-being. They encourage others to gracefully accept defeat when faced with failure, to step back, and reassess their situation. It is crucial to evaluate whether the venture is attainable and if they possess the necessary resources such as knowledge, training, skills, and finances to avoid potential poverty.\n\nTo illustrate the potential ramifications of unwise financial decisions, the narrator shares the unfortunate story of a friend who, as a result of trading penny stocks and subsequent losses, lost his entire bank balance and had to sell his home. In contrast, the narrator realizes that their pension income is sufficient to cover their bills, health insurance, and daily necessities. In their newfound state of peace, they have turned to writing stories for various platforms to occupy their time as they await the future.\n\nWhile recognizing that they may not achieve the same level of success as renowned figures such as Tim Denying or Alexandra Sifferelin, the individual finds contentment in their own journey and the harmonious relationship they have cultivated with themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the story of the Lamborghini Aventador serves as an entry point to a deeply introspective exploration of personal fulfillment and tranquility. It invites readers to reflect upon their own priorities, aspirations, and the true sources of happiness in their lives. END"}

This article marks the first part of a two-part series in which we will present fresh visualizations on the world of electric cars, including the leading manufacturers, the costs involved in going electric, the representation of different manufacturers on the road, and more.\n\n1. Who drives the most?\nFollowing San Marino, a low-population republic, the United States holds the unenviable distinction of having the highest number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. With 910 motor vehicles per 1,000 individuals, it surpasses other countries with more than one million inhabitants. New Zealand is next on the list with 774 cars per 1,000 people, closely followed by Italy (679), Canada (662), and Finland (612). On the other end of the spectrum, West African Togo, Bangladesh, Liberia, and the Solomon Islands have the fewest cars per 1,000 individuals, with the numbers being 2, 3, 3, and 3, respectively.\n\n2. Which country has the largest proportion of electric vehicles?\nNorway leads the way in terms of electric vehicle adoption. Over 40 percent of total new car sales between 2013 and 2017 were electric, making Norway the country with the highest per capita ownership of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) globally. Oslo, the capital of Norway, is widely recognized as the electric vehicle capital of the world. One of the secrets behind this achievement is the fact that 98 percent of Norway's electricity is produced from hydropower, resulting in one of the cleanest electric car fleets worldwide. Additionally, all electric cars and vans in Norway are exempt from on-purchase taxes. Iceland takes second place with 14 percent of total car sales being electric, while Andorra holds the third spot with 5.6 percent. Surprisingly, despite having the highest number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people, only 1.1 percent of vehicles in the United States are electric.\n\n3. Which U.S. states are leading the EV race?\nThe states leading the electric vehicle race in the United States are California, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Vermont, and Georgia, in that order. These states boast more than two electric vehicles registered per 1,000 people. Conversely, Mississippi ranks last with only one electric vehicle for every 6,667 people. Arkansas, West Virginia, and Louisiana are not far behind. Various factors, including state and local incentive programs, charging infrastructure, and fuel pricing, influence the number of EV registrations within a state.\n\n4. Who are the major players in the EV business?\nIt should come as no surprise that over 90 percent of Tesla's manufactured vehicles are electric. This figure overwhelmingly surpasses the second-place company, China's Zhou, with a 31 percent share, and third-place BYD Auto, also from China, with 12 percent. Other notable electric car manufacturers include BMW (0.7 percent), Nissan (0.6 percent), and General Motors (0.3 percent).\n\n5. Tesla's decline in European markets\nTesla experienced a decline in sales in several European countries in early 2018. Factors contributing to this downturn include increased competition, such as Porsche's all-electric Taycan, and a lack of significant rebates. The entry of other electric manufacturers, such as Jaguar with its new and relatively affordable I-Pace, is seen as direct competition to Tesla. Tesla countered claims of declining sales by stating that the data from IHS and regional transportation departments does not accurately reflect actual sales figures.\n\n6. What is the cost of charging an EV?\nAverage retail electricity prices have gradually increased over the past few decades. In 2017, the average price for one kilowatt-hour of electricity was approximately 11 cents, though regional variations exist, and prices fluctuate depending on the time of day. Each electric vehicle has a kilowatt-hour per 100-mile figure. Taking the Nissan Leaf as an example, with a value of 29, simple math shows that it would cost $3.19 to travel 100 miles (29 multiplied by 11). However, the cost of electricity is determined by utility company rates, and typically, the more electricity you consume, the more you pay. Consequently, charging your EV at a mall during your lunch break may be a more cost-effective option than charging at home.\n\n7. The decreasing cost of EV batteries\nDespite the expenses associated with charging EVs, the cost of lithium-ion batteries used in such vehicles has significantly decreased. Between 2009 and 2017, the average price decreased from $1,000 per kilowatt-hour to $209 per kilowatt-hour. For EVs to become cost-competitive with internal combustion engine vehicles, the price needs to reach approximately $100 per kilowatt-hour, a target that seems achievable.\n\n8. China's dominance in the lithium-ion battery market\nAlthough Tesla's Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, United States, is set to become the world's largest lithium-ion battery plant upon its completion, China is expected to remain the dominant producer of EV batteries over the next decade.\n\n9. and 10. Countries with the highest number of charging ports\nFrance took the crown for having the highest number of EV charge points in 2017, with a staggering 11,987 installations. This number exceeded Germany's count by 4,050. Other European countries, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Italy, Belgium, and Sweden, trail behind France. Canada secured the 10th position, having installed 1,070 charge points in 2017. Additionally, by 2020, the city of Montreal plans to establish its own network of 1,000 charging stations, costing $10 million. Tesla's \"Supercharger Network\" currently boasts 1,317 chargers worldwide. One of these chargers can provide the Tesla Model S with a range of 170 miles in just 30 minutes and a full charge in 75 minutes.\n\nIn our next post, we will delve into how Plot's home base of Quebec, Canada, is working to facilitate EV adoption. Stay tuned for insights on the promotion of electric vehicles in Montreal and the province of Quebec. END"}

( the aws lambda effect image idea source code example courtesy ) . source cuelogic blog","completion": " The term \"serverless architecture\" can be misleading, as it implies the absence of servers. In reality, serverless computing involves a third-party service provider who takes responsibility for processes, operating systems, and servers. This allows developers to focus solely on building software without the need for resource considerations such as deployment, configuration, and management. Companies can optimize their use of serverless functions and integrate them into larger data systems. \n\nAWS Lambda, which was launched in 2014, was the first major serverless offering. Since then, other providers such as Google Cloud Functions, Iron.io, Microsoft Azure Functions, and IBM Blue mix Openwork have entered the market with similar services on their clouds. Backend as a Service (Baas), Mobile Backend as Service, and Function as a Service (Fans) are approaches that work well with serverless architecture. \n\nAWS Lambda offers competitive pricing and operates on an event-driven computing model. This means that Lambda executes code in response to events, which can include changes to Amazon S3 buckets, updates to Amazon DynamoDB tables, or custom events generated by applications or devices. Lambda automatically prepares compute resources and runs the function or code moments after an event trigger, eliminating the need for unused server capacity and ensuring scalability and quick responses. \n\nMany startups have transitioned from monolithic application architecture to a microservices-driven architecture using AWS Lambda. For example, Group chat and messaging app Send bird and analytics platform Wavefront are utilizing Lambda for their services. By leveraging Lambda, developers can handle demand surges, such as user escalations on holidays, without having to manually create mechanisms to handle the increased traffic. Lambda supports multiple languages and libraries, including Python and JavaScript. \n\nAWS Lambda provides a collection of organized and extendable lambda functions called blueprints. These blueprints act as samples with event sources and lambda function configurations. \n\nServerless architecture works well with microservices and AWS Lambda is an ideal choice for companies that want to focus their resources on problem-solving. With its ability to scale and handle heavy traffic, AWS Lambda complements microservices effectively. The introduction of versioning features and Amazon API Gateway has made it easier to build scalable microservices for various applications, including IoT, web, and mobile. \n\nAWS Lambda also provides a straightforward framework for conducting lambda function tests through its blueprint library. Blueprints include functions for load testing and running unit tests, and the testing process is similar to testing any other lambda function. \n\nLambda can be used in conjunction with Amazon Machine Learning for tasks such as streaming data predictions or customized predictions by exposing a lambda function as an API. \n\nAdditionally, AWS Lambda can serve as an analytics option. Amazon Kinesis Analytics allows real-time processing of streaming data using standard SQL, without the need for processing frameworks or learning new programming languages. Kinesis stream captures and stores large volumes of data from various sources, enabling the creation of customized data applications to serve specific needs. Data can be picked up from the Kinesis stream and analyzed using Amazon Elasticsearch or Amazon Redshift, with real-time results displayed on a dashboard. \n\nServerless architecture is also beneficial for building big data pipelines. It offers high scalability, cost savings through per-execution pricing, and eliminates the need to manage a group of EC2 instances. The process of moving data from a source to a target through a big data pipeline is known as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). \n\nTo illustrate the usage of AWS Lambda, let's consider the example of creating a news blog app. In this case, a lambda function and API endpoint handle newsletter signups, while another lambda function and API endpoint retrieve the subscriber list. Admins can log in and collect the newsletter subscriber list using services such as IAM and Cognate for user authentication. DynamoDB is used as the database for storing newsletter subscriber information. \n\nTo create the app, DynamoDB needs to be set up first. Two lambda functions are then created: one to store the user email addresses and another to retrieve the email lists from the database. The functions are implemented using Node.js inline within the Lambda dashboard. The first function handles storing new subscribers, while the second function retrieves the subscriber list. \n\nThe AWS SDK is used to interact with other AWS services within the code. After the functions are implemented, they can be tested by clicking the test button on the Lambda dashboard. The results and any debugging information will be displayed. \n\nAWS Lambda has gained popularity due to the significant reduction in product launch time and cost savings for businesses. It eliminates the need to budget for underutilized or wasted computing and engineering capabilities. However, it is still in its early stages and needs to prove its effectiveness in enterprise IT functions such as testing, security, and configuration management. \n\nFor more information on serverless architecture, AWS Lambda, comparisons with similar computing services, and other aspects of technology, please visit our blog section.

It is crucial at every stage of business development, but especially in the beginning when mapping out business strategies, implementing new software, organizing your business, and setting yourself up for success. With the rise of online services, now is the time to turn that side hustle into dependable income. What fulfills a part-time interest today could become the foundation for a full-time writing career or other entrepreneurial opportunity in the future. Early freelancing success is possible. I launched a full-time writing business in July 2020 after not having worked a traditional job in over five years due to health issues. In July, I decided the time was right, and my expectations, although low, have been exceeded by the early success I am experiencing with Fiddle heads & Floss Writing Services.\n\nTo achieve early success in your freelance or solopreneur business, there are a few things you can do. In a previous article I wrote for The Startup, \"Building a Freelance Business from Scratch,\" I discussed the components of starting your own freelance business, such as establishing your business, effective communication, organization, and using good tools to run your business. These were all things I learned quickly as a new business owner. However, what I didn't share in depth was that I had previously been an entrepreneur in a different business. I ran a successful full-time hairdressing business for 16 years and also worked for large corporations, traveling the East Coast and teaching small seminars. What made my hairdressing business more profitable than others was my dedication to running it as a business. But what took me approximately two years in the beauty industry to see in terms of profits, I have now achieved with my writing career in less than three months.\n\nHere's how I have found early freelancing success and how you can too:\n\n1. Sow the soil: Before launching your business, it's essential to create fertile ground for your business to grow and flourish. Expand your reach by growing your social media presence and starting an email list. Develop connections with mentors and business professionals who can provide guidance and support. Begin building rapport with potential clients, even if it means taking on jobs at lower prices to gain references and build a portfolio.\n\n2. Clearly define your services & branding: To launch any business, you need direction. Potential clients need to know exactly who you are and what you have to offer them. While it's okay to explore new opportunities once established, starting out, it's crucial to provide stability and build trust with your clients. Treat every job, no matter how small, as an opportunity to build your business's reputation and ensure quality work.\n\n3. Set realistic goals and monitor your progress: Set specific goals for your business and hold yourself accountable to achieve them. By setting goals, you can analyze risk versus reward, time spent versus gain, expenditures versus necessity, and other important aspects of your business in a logical, purposeful manner.\n\n4. Diversify revenue streams: To be truly successful, it's important to have multiple revenue streams. Consider creating passive income streams and find ways to monetize various aspects of your business. Even if a revenue stream seems small, every bit adds up and contributes to your overall success.\n\n5. Practice self-discipline: As a business owner, self-discipline and time management are crucial. You are responsible for managing your time and ensuring the success of your business. Treat your business as a professional endeavor and commit to its success.\n\n6. Curb unnecessary spending: While it's important to invest in your business, be wise about your spending. Focus on essential functionality rather than unnecessary bells and whistles. Make investments that will help your business run smoothly and professionally, such as reliable software and tools. Your reputation and client perception of your business are paramount.\n\n7. Be honest about your strengths and weaknesses: Recognize areas where you excel and develop strategies to manage any weaknesses. Capitalize on your strengths and aim to build your business around them. However, be willing to develop skills in areas where you may be lacking. Invest in courses or training to improve your abilities and ensure the quality of your work.\n\nIn conclusion, achieving early success in your freelance business requires hard work, direction, and a clear vision of what you want to achieve. By setting yourself up for success and being dedicated to your business, you can find fulfillment and achieve your goals. Wishing you great success in your business endeavors. END"}
{"prompt": "the year is 2573 lilara\u2019s laughter fades into awed silence as the autocab drifts to a stop . it was a long ride from the johannesburg spaceport , but finally , the family had arrived at their destination lilara\u2019s mother\u2019s old family estate . her mom met her father there when he was just a 24-year-old graduate student performing ecological research on the 50 , 000-acre preserve . that was in 2088 when the desert was threatening to overtake everything completely . eventually , lilara\u2019s parents moved together to mars city two , also known as olympia , where they became leaders in the terraforming initiatives . over the next few centuries , mom and dad would end up holding some of the most senior roles in mars\u2019sci . because of them , mars was fast becoming a wet , green planet that would be on par with earth in another couple of centuries . after dinner in the guest house , the little family spent a few hours with lilara\u2019s grandparents in the vr world archeon , where all of her relatives who died since about 2100 continued to live . it was always bittersweet since everyone who visited knew that one day they would be there , too . all the archeonese assured the living , however , that they couldn\u2019t tell any difference between their biological lives and their virtual ones . mom and dad waited so long to become parents because they were busy , important people , and there was so much to do . but lilara knew that when they did decide to have her , it was the happiest choice they\u2019d ever made . they had spent a long time to make sure the people of earth could have a second home if they needed it , and now they would spend just as much time making sure their daughter could have the same opportunity if she ever chose to . immortality more than a few scientists believe that a baby born today might never die . \u201cimmortality\u201d is a loaded word , for sure in the broadest sense , it refers to not being able to die , ever . to know what immortality is , however , we need to define death . for us , death is a permanent cessation of all vital functions the end of life . ( merriam-webster ) there is cell death when all cell processes end and they begin to degenerate . there is also brain death . and then we have \u201cpoetic death\u201d , when the light goes out of a person\u2019s eyes , a soul escaping a damaged vessel and moving to a higher plane . death , as with life , is such a complicated matter with roots in both philosophy and science . for our purposes , we will say that death is when the body dies and takes with it a person\u2019s memory , personality , and consciousness . \u201cimmortality\u201d will be any state in which a person\u2019s memory , personality , and consciousness remain intact , in some accessible form , indefinitely . to many people , we are already immortal , in the sense that what makes us \u201cus\u201d , in the form of a soul , leaves our bodies upon biological death but then moves on to an afterlife . what might keep lilara and her family going for centuries ? we may find some of the answers in creatures that we\u2019ve shared this pale blue dot with for aeons . the undying things among us a german marine biology student discovered turritopsis dohrnii in 1988 when he was researching hydrozoan invertebrates on the italian riviera . he kept this strange species , which he didn\u2019t recognise , in a petri dish , just as he did with other findings , and observed it over the course of the next week . rather than reproducing or dying , as expected , his turritopsis dohrnii specimens behaved very differently it appeared to be ageing in \u201creverse\u201d , and returning to earlier stages of its life cycle . here he had found a real-life curious case of benjamin button , or , shall we say , jeremy jellyfish . other researchers continued to study turritopsis dohrnii over the ensuing decade , ultimately publishing a paper in 1996 by ferdinando boero et al . titled \u201creversing the life cycle\u201d . the creature was examined in great detail and observed returning to its earliest life stage for jellies ( the polyp form ) . in the decades since , we have come to understand this a bit better . when stressed by its environment , members of this jelly\u2019s genus undergo the process of cellular transdifferentiation , when various cells transform into other types of cell , which is what occurs with human stem cells . now popularised as the \u201cimmortal jellyfish\u201d , we still don\u2019t completely grasp all of the intricacies of how turritopsis dohrnii does what it does . the little creatures have been spreading around the world , moving from the mediterranean in cargo ship seawater ballast , and can now be found from the caribbean to japanese waters . kevin j . peterson is a molecular biologist at dartmouth studying the mechanism by which our immortal jellyfish continues in its constant forward , backward , forward cycle . this is controlled , seemingly , by a genetic material called microrna which appears to cause stem cells to move from their undifferentiated state to its fated form ( heart cell , brain cell , skin cell , etc . ) . james carlton , a professor of marine sciences at williams college in massachusetts , says , \u201c \u201cthat word \u2018immortal\u2019 is distracting . if by \u2018immortal\u2019 you mean passing on your genes , then yes , it\u2019s immortal . but those are not the same cells anymore . the cells are immortal , but not necessarily the organism itself . \u201d in essence , when our immortal jellyfish\u2019s cells transdifferentiate , it is just returning its cells to their primary undifferentiated forms . it then re-builds them into new versions of their differentiated forms , creating what is essentially a clone of the original jelly . other earthly living things may be immortal ( and could be included along with some of the most extreme creatures here ) , or at the least are astonishingly long-lived remarkably similar to the immortal jelly is the freshwater hydra polyp , which also seems to be able to live indefinitely . it regenerates lost appendages and never shows signs of cellular senescence or ageing . red sea urchins seem to be able to continue living , reproducing and regenerating almost indefinitely once they grow out of their larval stage . the bristlecone pine of north america can live thousands of years . one specimen , nicknamed \u201cmethuselah\u201d after the longest-lived human named in the old testament , has been dated at over 4 , 700 years . this nigh-immortality also seems to be related to stem cells , as described in this research paper from 2013 . the arctica islandica ocean quahog clam can live for over 500 years . one was found in 2006 , nicknamed \u201cming the mollusc\u201d , but was summarily placed in a freezer by the researchers not realising it would turn out to be of record-breaking age . these clams , along with numerous other long-lived bivalves , tend to follow a rule common among many animals the longer it takes to reach reproductive maturity , and the slower the animal\u2019s growth rate in general , the longer its lifespan tends to be post-maturity . long life isn\u2019t just reserved for small , less complex animals . the aldabra giant tortoise , tuatara lizards , rougheye rockfish , greenland shark , koi , and even the huge bowhead whale have all been found in many cases to live longer than 200 years . and let us not forget ourselves , asian elephants and macaws who all share lifespans between 70\u201380 years when provided with proper care and nutrition . technology as savior of biology immortality for humans could take many forms . as quantum computing progresses , thanks to continued efforts of ibm and others , our potential to store the immense complexity that is a human mind grows . in the march 2018 issue of fortune , write grace donnelly reports on the y combinator venture nectome that is aiming to preserve brain structure through a chemical freezing process , with the hopes that memory and knowledge will also be preserved and can somehow be copied . photo by andy kelly on unsplash dr ian pearson , a british futurologist and author of you tomorrow , places paths to immortality into three buckets \u201cliving\u201d in virtual worlds . \u201cliving\u201d in android bodies . and renewing the human body . the first two are essentially the same and would likely both be possible if either one comes to be . this is because the fundamental problem that needs to be solved for each is the same can the mind be somehow downloaded or otherwise copied ? \u201ca complete map of the human brain containing detailed information about each neuron and synapse would occupy about 20 , 000 terabytes and require 1016 flops ( floating point operations per second ) of processing power to function . currently , only the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer possesses the capability of crunching that many numbers in a second . \u201d -jordan inafuku , et . al . if what makes a person a person is all in the structure of the brain , many scientists feel that this is essentially possible , and with enough advances in technology we will eventually be able to make a copy of ourselves . if there is a \u201cmissing ingredient\u201d that results in consciousness and that is responsible for making you \u201cyou\u201d , something that cannot be recreated by just building an exact structure of neurons , we may be out of luck . we may find we can copy the structure and information of a mind , but when we \u201cboot\u201d it up all we see is hard data and a complete lack of anything like self-awareness . renewing the human body can take numerous forms , and would likely be a combination of replacement parts and gene therapy based on trends in current medical technology . advances in lab-grown organs , such as these fallopian tubes , and 3d printing ( called \u201cbioprinting ) will probably make traditional transplanted , and artificial organs and even limbs seem antique by the middle of this century . stem cell infusion therapy is also proving quite promising , as detailed in the results of a study published in april 2017 in the journals of gerontology . fifteen frail patients between the ages of 60 and 95 each received stem cell transfusions from donors between the ages of 20\u201345 , and six months later , all patients were healthier . and what happens when we achieve immortality ? if we can keep our bodies and minds intact for many multiples of our natural lifespan , this will not be a guarantee of eternal bliss . unless all of us become \u201cimmortal\u201d at once , there would be a long time during which only small numbers of people might be transcending our biological limits . perhaps the treatments and procedures are only affordable by the very wealthy , resulting in situations much like those found in the recent netflix series altered carbon , the 2013 neill blomkamp film elysium and the 1990 orson scott card novel the worthing saga . and no matter if our minds end up in a massive vr simulation , android bodies , or they remain in biological construct or cloned bodies , there is the problem of how much moving through the vastness of time itself might affect us . how long can one consciousness continue to operate in an uninterrupted state before a psychological problem develops ? the boredom of everyday existence generally affects most modern humans with varying psychological impact even before their eighth decade of life . imagine eight centuries . and time would eventually seem to become a blur , as we experience and remember things relative to how long we\u2019ve lived in total . beyond those issues , there is the question of how we would handle the increased overpopulation that would result from widespread \u201cimmortality\u201d . ultimately , one thing that can\u2019t be ignored is that immortality may not be possible at all . inevitably , given enough time for the science to catch up to our imaginations , we will be able to prolong the lifespans of our bodies significantly , and perhaps even copy and download our minds and preserve self-awareness and consciousness . just as with the tiny turritopsis dohrnii , which must completely remake itself in order to never truly die , most paths to our immortality will require that same sacrifice . copying a mind would be similar to creating another instance of a database . for a while , at least , you would have 2 of the same thing , and the original must either be kept or destroyed . but the copy would not be the original . it may seem that way to an outside observer , and the copy may not even know it\u2019s a copy . the fact is , though , that the copy is a new thing , a new person , whether built from a brain scan or regenerated cell by cell in a lab . eugen suman , a fellow thinker and futurist , based in romania , says regarding the above problem ( dubbed the \u201ccontinuity paradox\u201d ) that we can \u2026imagine this scenario you get injected with an army of nanobots that , over a period of ten or more years , will replace your brain cells one by one with \u201cartificial cells\u201d so that at the end of the ten years you will have a new artificial brain instead of the old one you possessed . most people would agree that in the second scenario it would still be you\u2026 this is a variation on ideas put forth by famed futurists ray kurzweil and hans moravec . replacing our mortal brain with immortal substrate the smallest possible piece at a time while keeping it all connected offers the best \u2014 if not yet feasible \u2014 chance at keeping our identity . so there may well be a way to create a true immortality loop for humans , given enough time and technological advancement . still , we are left with the potential development of various psychoses or other unforeseen problems that will arise with extremely long-lived consciousnesses . immortality can only ever go so far . thank you for reading and sharing .","completion": " In the year 2573, Clara and her family arrive at their destination, her mother's old family estate. Clara's parents played a vital role in the terraforming initiatives on Mars, making it a wet, green planet that could potentially become a second home for Earthlings. The family embraces their time together, even visiting their deceased relatives in the virtual reality world Archean.\n\nThe concept of immortality is explored, with scientists theorizing that babies born today may never experience death. Immortality can be defined as the state of not being able to die, with death being the permanent cessation of vital functions. Some believe that immortality lies in the afterlife, where the soul lives on after biological death.\n\nDrawing inspiration from nature, scientists have discovered creatures like the Turritopsis Dominic jellyfish that exhibit reverse aging, returning to earlier stages of life instead of dying. This phenomenon, known as transdifferentiation, occurs when cells transform into different types, similar to human stem cell processes. Other earthly creatures, such as the Hydra polyp, Red Sea urchins, and bristle cone pines, also display longevity.\n\nAdvancements in technology offer potential paths to human immortality. Quantum computing could enable the storage of complex human minds, preserving memory and knowledge even after physical death. Become, a venture aiming to preserve brain structure through chemical freezing, explores the possibility of copying memory and knowledge.\n\nDr. Ian Pearson, a British futurologist, suggests three possibilities for achieving immortality: living in virtual worlds, living in android bodies, or renewing the human body through replacement parts and gene therapy. Stem cell infusion therapy shows promise in rejuvenating aging patients.\n\nHowever, attaining immortality raises various challenges. If only a select few achieve immortality, it could lead to societal disparities akin to those depicted in popular culture. Furthermore, the psychological impact of existing for centuries and increased population due to immortality must be considered.\n\nIt's essential to understand that true immortality may not be achievable. The idea of copying a mind raises questions about identity and whether the duplicate is truly the original. The continuity paradox suggests that replacing our mortal brain gradually with an immortal substrate offers the best chance of preserving our identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of immortality is intriguing and potential paths to achieve it exist, challenges and ethical considerations must be addressed. Immortality, if possible, may come with unforeseen consequences that require careful examination. END"}
{"prompt": "however , the path very often turns to be rough . there\u2019s a lot of obstacles to deal with to make something just good . in between 18th and 19th centuries when the industrial revolution took place , and technological progress allowed to manufacture faster and in a high volume , the three pillars of design were defined voice of business . how do you as a designer respond to a company\u2019s business model to make a product relevant ?

voice of customer . how do you answer people\u2019s needs ? how do you solve people\u2019s problems ? how effectively do you solve those problems ? how do you design to embrace individualities ? how do you design for people to enrich their lives ? that looks like a challenge . and it is . you see , i think we as designers need a tremendous amount of self-discipline to be good in what we do . answering those questions above , facing them in the most successful way , requires a thing that i find the most precious quality of us designers , a thing that we constantly tend to learn \u2014 humility . humility \u2014 \u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea , hebrew \u201canavah\u201d \u2014 a sign of strength and purpose , not weakness . we often mislead humility with weakness , whereas it\u2019s a strength . we can be highly skilled specialists , using the most advanced tools , but a result of our work comes from a process , from our relationship with whom we collaborate . way before a product meets customers , we designers meet business stakeholders and engineers , people responsible for revenue and the fact that our ideas can come to life . that\u2019s the place for us designers serving others with humility which is represented by ability to listening not stealing somebody\u2019s air being aware that sometimes we may be wrong there\u2019s a beauty in the service of being responsible for giving a form to business intention and implementing solutions . by being designers we tend to brilliantly communicate however by asking questions . so much can be unheard when we\u2019re not attentively listening to barely formed , fragile thoughts that have got a chance to be a foundation for a fabulous solution . during ideation and execution , any contribution is a new point of view , that can pivot a project in a way more beneficial to a final result , therefore we designers are expected to create a convenient environment for others to collaborate . and finally , constant learning means being ready to fail and seek an outcome from it to bring the value to our teams , to a project , and therefore to customers . sadly , very often customers can be victims of design , instead of being beneficiaries of it . unfortunately , we stick at looking for a balance between a look and function . obviously , a product looking good but having a very poorly solved functionality can be ugly . in the same time , we often try to believe that the thing that predominantly matters is functionality . but we very rarely ask the question \u201cwhat do we want people to feel ? \u201d you see , designing is three dimensional . i believe that we designers do what we do in the service of aesthetics , function , and feelings that someone , somewhere had using a product we designed . do you remember the smell of just unboxed product that you had waited for a while ?

In the 18th and 19th centuries, during the industrial revolution, the pillars of design were established: the voice of business, the voice of technology, and the voice of the customer. As a designer, it is crucial to respond to a company's business model in order to create a relevant product.\n\nWhen considering the voice of business, it is important to understand and align with the company's goals and objectives. By doing so, designers can create products that not only meet the business's needs but also contribute to its success. Designing within a budget while ensuring the product is well-made requires a careful balance of creativity, resourcefulness, and problem-solving.\n\nThe voice of technology plays a significant role in the design process as well. Designers must understand the technological capabilities and limitations in order to create products that are both innovative and feasible. By leveraging technology effectively, designers can push the boundaries of what is possible while ensuring the product functions seamlessly.\n\nThe voice of the customer should always be at the forefront of a designer's mind. Understanding and addressing the needs and problems of the end-users is crucial in creating products that resonate with them. By empathizing with the target audience and solving their problems effectively, designers can enhance their lives and create positive experiences.\n\nDesigning for individualizes and embracing diversity is a challenge that requires humility. As designers, we must approach our work with self-discipline and a willingness to learn. Humility is not a weakness but a strength that allows us to listen attentively, collaborate effectively, and acknowledge the possibility of being wrong. By being humble, we can serve others and contribute to meaningful and impactful design outcomes.\n\nContinual learning and growth are also essential for designers. Being open to failure and leveraging it as an opportunity for improvement and innovation is crucial. This constant quest for knowledge and improvement enables designers to bring value to their teams, projects, and ultimately, to the customers they serve.\n\nDesigners hold a tremendous responsibility in ensuring that customers are the beneficiaries of design, rather than its victims. Balancing aesthetics and functionality is crucial, but we must also consider the emotional aspect of design. How do we want people to feel when they interact with our products? Designing with care and attention to detail can create unforgettable experiences and build strong emotional connections with customers.\n\nFurthermore, designers have a responsibility towards the environment. Our choices in materials, tools, and processes have a significant impact on the planet. We must consider sustainability and make responsible decisions that benefit not only business, technology, and customers, but also our shared home. By being proactive and deliberate in our solutions, we can contribute to a better quality of life for future generations.\n\nBeing a designer requires maturity and self-awareness.

This tool has proven to be valuable for me as it allows me to quickly jot down random thoughts, reminders, and most importantly, my to-do list. By having my to-do list prominently displayed and easily accessible, it serves as a constant reminder to stay focused and on track. This technique has been highly effective for me, especially since a majority of my tasks are conducted online. When I open a new tab, my to-do list is the first thing I see, making it nearly impossible to get sidetracked by opening social media platforms or entertainment websites since it serves as a constant visual reminder of the tasks I should be prioritizing. This method has been successfully utilized by a variety of individuals, ranging from startup founders to kitchen caretakers, mothers, office workers, and even lawyers. The key to an effective to-do list is to avoid overwhelming it with an excessive number of tasks. Instead, it is advisable to focus on solving no more than three major tasks, preferably just one, each day.\n\nOne strategy I employ, which I learned from the prolific writer James Blucher, is to brainstorm 10 ideas each day. This exercise helps to stimulate creativity and is particularly useful for writers, although it can benefit individuals from various professions. While most of the topics I jot down may not be utilized, I often discover one or two ideas from the list that turn into great pieces of work. I would encourage anyone, even non-writers, to practice this exercise. For example, if you are a parent trying to decide what to cook for dinner, challenge yourself to come up with 10 different meal ideas. If you are a comedian, strive to create 10 new jokes. If you are an artist, attempt 10 quick sketches. This exercise not only enhances creativity but also operates on the principle that the more ideas generated, the greater the chances of generating good ideas.\n\nAnother important technique is to disable all notifications and turn your phone on silent. Even though this may seem self-explanatory, it is surprising how many individuals fail to implement this practice at work. Social media notifications, email alerts, and any form of notification, in general, can significantly hinder productivity. Our minds are naturally inclined to feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when we see that we have completed a task or received a message. This is due to the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, by our brains. It is the same reason why people engage in activities such as drinking, gambling, or having sex. Disabling notifications is a simple yet effective solution. Most phones provide settings or apps that allow users to set notifications to silent or disable them entirely. Personally, I use the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature on both my MacBook and iPhone to achieve this. For unavoidable notifications such as those from Medium (since I am a writer by profession), I utilize a Chrome extension called Stylish. This extension allows me to modify the appearance of a website, enabling me to hide notifications using CSS rules. Please note that using Stylish requires some technical proficiency.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can enhance your productivity and ability to stay focused on an increasingly distraction-filled world.

Many of us are driven to become better developers by personal goals, a curiosity about how computers work, or the pride that comes from creating something tangible. Some individuals find inspiration from other successful developers at a young age, while others become interested in computer science during their high school or college years, experimenting with application development on their own. The path to becoming a developer is influenced by various factors.\n\nI still remember my first code, a simple hangman game. During that time, there were many popular video games that I wanted to play, so I spent more time immersed in gaming rather than creating games myself. However, my priorities have shifted since then. Nowadays, I dedicate more time to software development, constantly striving to improve my skills. I have been fortunate enough to meet and collaborate with numerous successful developers along the way, using their experiences as inspiration to enhance my own abilities. I have read numerous articles about successful individuals and how they achieved their goals. These insights have provided me with alternative perspectives and valuable lessons.\n\nPersonally, I believe that hands-on experience is essential in any field that requires mastery. Many successful individuals, both in their careers and personal lives, share common principles. Practice is one such principle \u2013 if you want to achieve something, you must devote time and effort to practice. Thomas Edison, while working on inventing the electric lamp, famously remarked, \"I have not failed 10,000 times. I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work. When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work.\" This quote teaches us the importance of perseverance and learning from mistakes.\n\nPeople often become frustrated when they are unable to accomplish something or fear making mistakes. However, making mistakes is an inevitable part of the learning process. If we never made mistakes, there would be nothing to learn from. Therefore, we must not fear being wrong or making mistakes, as they contribute to our growth and development.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey to becoming a better developer is unique for each individual, but there are common principles and practices that can help us succeed. Taking inspiration from successful developers, dedicating time to practice, and embracing the inevitable mistakes along the way are all essential components of becoming a proficient developer. END"}
{"prompt": "clouds on mars could have been caused by meteors how did mars get its clouds ? new research suggests the key ingredient could have been meteors . clouds in mars\u2019 middle atmosphere , which begins about 18 miles \u2014 30 kilometres \u2014 above the surface , have been known to scientists and astronomers but they have , thus far , struggled to explain how they formed . a new study \u2014 published on june 17th in the journal nature geoscience \u2014 may have solved this martian cloud mystery . the paper from researchers at cu boulder examines those wispy accumulations suggesting that they are a result of a phenomenon known as meteoric smoke \u2014 the icy dust created by space debris slamming into the planet\u2019s atmosphere . an important aspect of the paper\u2019s findings is the reminder that the atmospheres of planets and their weather patterns should not be considered isolated from their host solar systems . victoria hartwick is a graduate student in the department of atmospheric and ocean sciences ( atoc ) and lead author of the new study . she elaborates \u201cwe\u2019re used to thinking of earth , mars and other bodies as these really self-contained planets that determine their own climates . but climate isn\u2019t independent of the surrounding solar system . \u201d discovering the origins of martian cloud seeds the research \u2014 co-authored by brian toon at cu boulder and nicholas heavens at hampton university in virginia \u2014 centres on the fact clouds seem to form from nowhere . hartwick points out that this doesn\u2019t mean they appear spontaneously . she says \u201cclouds don\u2019t just form on their own . they need something that they can condense onto . \u201d an example is clouds on our own planet \u2014 low-lying clouds begin life as tiny grains of sea salt or dust blown high into the air , water molecules then collate around these particles . this gathering of water molecules becomes bigger and bigger eventually forming the accumulations we can see from the ground . hartwick says that the problem in cracking the martian cloud mystery is that those sorts of cloud seed don\u2019t exist in mars\u2019 middle atmosphere . thus leading and her colleagues to suspect meteors and space debris could act as defacto cloud seeds . as hartwick says \u2014 approximately two to three tons of space debris crash into mars every day , ripping apart the planet\u2019s atmosphere and injecting a huge volume of dust into the air . to discover if those dust clouds would be sufficient to give rise to mars\u2019 mysterious clouds , hartwick and her team created massive computer simulations to model the flows and turbulence of the planet\u2019s atmosphere . when they accounted for meteors in their calculations \u2014 clouds appeared . hartwick says \u201cour model couldn\u2019t form clouds at these altitudes before . but now , they\u2019re all there , and they seem to be in all the right places . \u201d hartwick and her team mars cloud simulations ( hartwick ) whilst hartwick concedes that the model may initially sound unlikely , research has also shown that similar interplanetary debris and dust may help to seed clouds near earth\u2019s poles . despite this , the team warn that we shouldn\u2019t expect to see gigantic thunderheads forming above the surface of mars anytime soon as the clouds produced in the simulation were more thin and nebulous than those we experience on earth . a nasa balloon mission examined the rippling , electric blue clouds found high over earth\u2019s poles during twilight in summertime . ( nasa ) hartwick adds that just because are thin and wouldn\u2019t be visible to the naked eye , that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t have an effect on the dynamics of the climate . the simulations show that middle atmosphere clouds , for instance , could have a large impact on the martian climate . depending on where the team looked , those clouds could cause temperatures at high altitudes to swing up or down by as much as 10\u2070 c . it is this climactic impact which brian toon \u2014 a professor in atoc \u2014 finds most compelling . he believes that the team\u2019s findings with regards to modern-day martian clouds may also help to reveal details of the red planet\u2019s evolution including how it once managed to support liquid water at its surface . toon points out \u201cmore and more climate models are finding that the ancient climate of mars when rivers were flowing across its surface and life might have originated , was warmed by high altitude clouds . \u201cit is likely that this discovery will become a major part of that idea for warming mars . \u201d original research","completion": " Clouds on Mars may have been caused by meteors, according to new research published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Scientists at CU Boulder conducted a study on the wispy clouds in Mars' middle atmosphere, approximately 18 miles (30 kilometers) above the surface, which have previously puzzled researchers. The study suggests that these clouds are formed by a phenomenon called meteoric smoke, which is the icy dust created when space debris collides with the planet's atmosphere.\n\nThe research emphasizes that the atmospheres of planets and their weather patterns should be considered in relation to their host solar systems. Victoria Hart wick, a graduate student in the Department of Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences at CU Boulder and the lead author of the study, explains that planets like Earth and Mars should not be viewed as self-contained entities but rather as influenced by their surrounding solar systems.\n\nThe study aims to uncover the origins of clouds on Mars, as they appear to form seemingly out of nowhere. Hart wick clarifies that clouds do not form independently but require a substance onto which they can condense. For example, on Earth, low-lying clouds start as small particles of sea salt or dust that are lifted high into the air, and water molecules then gather around these particles, gradually forming visible clouds. However, such cloud seeds do not exist in Mars' middle atmosphere, leading Hart wick and her colleagues to propose that meteors and space debris act as de facto cloud seeds.\n\nApproximately 2 to 3 tons of space debris crash into Mars every day, injecting a significant amount of dust into the air. To investigate whether these dust clouds are sufficient to give rise to Mars' mysterious clouds, Hart wick and her team created computer simulations to model the flows and turbulence of the planet's atmosphere. When they incorporated meteors into their calculations, clouds formed in the right places at the right altitudes.\n\nAlthough the simulations produced clouds more thin and nebulous than those on Earth, Hart wick emphasizes that even thin clouds can have an impact on the climate dynamics. The simulations show that middle atmosphere clouds on Mars could cause temperatures at high altitudes to fluctuate by as much as 10\u00a0\u00b0C. Brian Too, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences at CU Boulder, finds this climatic impact particularly compelling. He believes that the team's findings regarding modern-day clouds on Mars may provide insights into the planet's evolution and how it once supported liquid water on its surface.\n\nWhile the study offers intriguing possibilities, the researchers caution against expecting massive thunderhead clouds to form above the surface of Mars anytime soon. Future research will likely explore further details of Mars' ancient climate and its potential influence on the planet's ability to sustain liquid water. END"}

This shift is driven by the fact that people have a strong affinity for watching videos, with Facebook users collectively spending 100 million hours per day consuming video content. If you are not currently utilizing Facebook ads to grow your business, now is the time to start. Here are nine compelling reasons why:\n\n1. Lead Ads: Facebook's lead ads are not only cost-effective but also incredibly effective. These ads eliminate the need for users to visit your website by allowing you to gather valuable contact information from potential customers directly on Facebook. Leveraging lead ads, you can prompt sign-ups for your email newsletter, offer exclusive deals or discounts, schedule appointments, and more.\n\n2. Video Ads: Facebook's video ads offer an excellent and affordable advertising solution, with costs as low as one cent per video view. Video ads leave a lasting impression, surpassing the recall and engagement levels of conventional text and image combinations. By uploading your videos to Facebook's native video player and customizing the description, thumbnail, budget, and targeting, you can maximize the impact of your advertising campaigns.\n\n3. Engagement Ads on Wall Posts: Engagement ads create an illusion of popularity for your Facebook page, appealing to individuals checking out your business. Facebook only displays these ads to users most likely to engage with your posts, whether through reactions, comments, or shares. While amassing a multitude of reactions and comments may be superficial in nature, it fuels a desire to be part of the inner circle. A Facebook page with no fan interaction may raise doubts about your business's credibility.\n\n4. Remarketing: Facebook's remarketing functionality allows you to reconnect with individuals who have previously interacted with your brand in various ways. Whether they visited your website, engaged with specific pages or actions in your app or game, or provided contact information, Facebook tags these individuals with a cookie. By targeting these users with remarketing ads that appear in their Facebook news feeds, you can bolster their awareness of your brand and optimize conversions for your key offers. Familiarity with your brand increases the likelihood of conversion and engagement.\n\n5. Interest Targeting: Facebook's interest targeting enables you to identify individuals who are most likely to be interested in your product or service. By leveraging audience segments based on their interests, activities, and liked pages, you can tailor your ads to specific niches. Interests can be combined to expand your ad's reach, allowing you to target audiences fascinated with technology, fitness and wellness, entertainment, or specific business industries.\n\n6. Demographic Targeting: With Facebook's demographic targeting, you can home in on individuals based on their location, age, gender, political leanings, job titles, and life events such as engagements, birthdays, or anniversaries. This feature also offers financial targeting, enabling you to display ads exclusively to individuals with a certain income level, whether it's as low as $30,000 or more than $500,000. If you market high-end products, it's crucial to ensure your ads are shown to individuals with the means to afford them.\n\n7. Behavior Targeting: Facebook's behavior targeting empowers you to reach individuals based on their purchasing history, intent, device usage, and more. By leveraging data from third-party partners, Facebook identifies individuals' online and offline purchases. It then matches this data with user IDs to create audience segments based on various purchasing behaviors. For instance, you can target ads to individuals who have bought clothing, health and beauty products, technology, or pet products. If travel is your focus, you can target frequent travelers, international travelers, or individuals who have used a travel app recently.\n\n8. The Facebook Pixel: Facebook's tracking pixel allows you to monitor the actions that result from your paid ads and organic posts on your website. By including a snippet of code on specific pages, you can track various actions such as adding items to a cart, viewing content, making purchases, or completing registrations. The tracking pixel provides valuable insights into conversions, ad and targeting optimization, and user behavior on your website.\n\n9. Website Conversion Campaigns: When your objective is to drive specific actions on your website or mobile app, conversion campaigns are the ideal choice. These campaigns enable you to define the desired action, whether it's completing a purchase, adding products to a cart, or simply viewing a page.\n\n10. Carousel Ads: Carousel ads allow you to showcase multiple images or videos within a single ad unit, with support for up to ten pieces of visual content. Each image or video can link to a different page on your website, enabling you to highlight various products, features, or promotions. When executed effectively, carousel ads have shown significant improvements in conversion rates and click-through rates.\n\nBonus: Facebook Messenger Bots: Businesses now have the option to create bots for Facebook Messenger, enabling constant communication with customers, 24/7. With the ability to provide automated information, take orders, facilitate purchases, and offer shipping notifications, these chatbots hold immense potential for enhancing customer service and driving sales. The convenience of shopping or obtaining information without leaving Facebook Messenger is a major advantage.\n\nThese are just a few of my favorite Facebook advertising features. What are yours?\n\nAbout the Author: Larry Kim is the CEO of MobileMonkey and the founder of Nord Stream. You can stay connected with him on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram.\n\nOriginally posted on Inc.com. END"}

At the time, the topic had yet to fully permeate the American mainstream consciousness; it was merely a murmur, a distant echo of worrisome reports coming out of Italy and Iran, and occasional reminders to practice good hygiene. None of us present at that moment personally knew anyone who had been afflicted by the disease, and our lives continued on with minimal disruption. However, we couldn't help but notice the sudden surge in demand for hand sanitizers, the rise in companies implementing work-from-home policies, and the increasing appearances of healthcare experts on national news platforms issuing cautionary statements that challenged our sense of invulnerability. Whispers about travel restrictions and school closures began to circulate, and an intangible unease started to infiltrate the atmosphere. Taking all these distinct signs into consideration, one of my friends furrowed their brow and posed the question, \"So, is this like an apocalypse?\" I smiled and perhaps even let out a mild chuckle, asking if they actually meant to use the term \"epidemic\" instead. They nodded in agreement, acknowledging the possible error. It was an exchange that has stayed with me ever since. At the moment, I dismissed their remark as a mere slip of the tongue\u2014a verbal typo, if you will. The word \"apocalypse\" seemed incongruous with literal, mature discussions. To me, it was inextricably linked to the biblical Book of Revelation\u2014the narrative of the \"end times\"\u2014laden with symbolic imagery of cosmic upheaval, supernatural devastation, and final reckoning. So, naturally, it couldn't possibly apply to our current situation, right? Surely, if the heavens weren't being torn asunder, if we weren't being ravaged by angels of doom, and if the moon (or was it the sun?) hadn't turned a foreboding shade of crimson, then an apocalypse was not what we were experiencing. That was my line of thinking. Until I remembered that the true etymology of the word \"apocalypse\" (derived from the Greek \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 or apocalypses) simply means \"to uncover, reveal, expose.\" Setting aside the notions of antichrists and infernal armies, a literal apocalypse is merely an event in which a concealed object, reality, or truth is unveiled. Suddenly, my friend's words take on a profound, dare I say prophetic, significance. Because, thus far, this global upheaval has indeed felt like an immense revelation, a worldwide unmasking\u2014an uncovering of harsh truths that we have, for far too long and far too often, obscured.

{"prompt": "how storage works in prometheus , and why is this important ? learn the bases that make prometheus , so a great solution to monitor your workloads and use it for your own benefit . photo by vincent botta on unsplash prometheus is one of the key systems in nowadays cloud architectures . the second graduated project from the cloud native computing foundation ( cncf ) after kubernetes itself , and it is the monitoring solution for excellence in most of the workloads running on kubernetes . if you already have used prometheus some time , you know that it relies on a time series database , and it is one of the key elements . based on their own words from the prometheus official page every time series is uniquely identified by its metric name and optional key-value pairs called labels , and that series is similar to the tables in a relational model . and inside each of those series , we have the samples that are similar to the tuples . and each of the samples contains a float value and a milliseconds-precision timestamp . default on-disk approach by default , prometheus uses a local-storage approach storing all those samples on disk . this data is distributed on different files and folders to group different chunks of data . so , we ve folders to create those groups , and by default , they are a two-hour block and can contain one or more files depends on the amount of data ingested in that period of time as each folder contains all the samples for that specific timeline . additionally , each folder also has some kind of metadata files that help locate each of the data files ' metrics . a file is persistent in a complete manner when the block is over , and before that , it keeps in memory and uses a write-ahead log technical to recover the data in case of a crash of the prometheus server . so , at a high-level view , the directory structure of a prometheus server\u2019s data directory will look something like this remote storage integration default on-disk storage is good and has some limitations in terms of scalability and durability , even considering the performance improvement of the latest version of the tsdb . so , if we\u2019d like to explore other options to store this data , prometheus provides a way to integrate with remote storage locations . it provides an api that allows writing samples that are being ingested into a remote url and , at the same time , be able to read back sample data for that remote url as shown in the picture below as always in anything related to prometheus , the number of adapters created using this pattern is huge , and it can be seen in the following link in detail summary knowing how the storage of prometheus works is critical to understand how we can optimize their usage to improve the performance of our monitoring solution and provide a cost-efficient deployment . in the following posts , we\u2019re going to cover how we can optimize the usage of this storage layer , making sure that only the metrics and sample that are important to use are being stored and also how to analyze which metrics are the ones using most of the time-series database to be able to take good decision about which metrics should be dropped and which ones should be kept . so , stay tuned for the next post regarding how we can have a better life with prometheus and not die in the attempt .","completion": " The storage mechanism in Prometheus plays a crucial role in its functionality and overall importance in modern cloud architectures. Being the second project to graduate from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), after Kubernetes, Prometheus serves as the monitoring solution of choice for numerous workloads running on Kubernetes.\n\nPrometheus relies on a time series database, which serves as a fundamental element in its operations. According to the Prometheus official page, each time series is uniquely identified by its metric name and optional key-value pairs known as labels. These series resemble tables in a relational model. Within each series, there are samples, which can be likened to tuples. Every sample contains a float value and a timestamp with millisecond precision.\n\nBy default, Prometheus adopts a local-storage approach, where all samples are stored on disk. The data is distributed across various files and folders to group different chunks of data. Each folder represents a two-hour block and can contain one or more files, depending on the volume of data ingested within that time frame. Each folder also possesses metadata files that aid in locating the data files' metrics. In terms of durability, a file is persistently stored once the block is complete. Prior to that, it remains in memory and utilizes a write-ahead log technique to recover data in the event of a Prometheus server crash. This high-level view demonstrates the structure of a Prometheus server's data directory.\n\nWhile the default on-disk storage approach is generally sound, it does have limitations in terms of scalability and durability. Despite the performance enhancements in the latest version of the time series database (TSDB), Prometheus offers the flexibility to integrate with remote storage options. It provides an API that enables sample data to be written to a remote URL during ingestion, while also allowing for the retrieval of sample data from that remote URL. The availability of numerous adapters built using this pattern highlights the versatility of remote storage integration within Prometheus.\n\nUnderstanding how Prometheus's storage works is critical for optimizing its usage, enhancing monitoring solution performance, and achieving cost efficiency in deployment. In future posts, we will explore ways to optimize the storage layer, ensuring that only relevant metrics and samples are stored. Additionally, we will discuss how to analyze which metrics consume the most resources in the time-series database, enabling informed decisions about dropping unnecessary metrics and retaining essential ones. Stay tuned for the forthcoming post that will help you make the most out of your Prometheus experience and avoid potential pitfalls. END"}

First, you need to specify a few parameters:\n\n- `dataset_path`: The location of your dataset in the file system.\n- `label_name`: The target label column name.\n- `task`: Use \"r\" for regression and \"c\" for classification.\n- `dummy_batch_size`: This parameter can be ignored and set to 5.\n- `batch_size`: The batch size for training.\n- `epochs`: The number of training epochs.\n- `train_franc`: The fraction of data to be used for training, between 0 and 1.\n- `checkpoint_Dir`: The folder to store check pointed models.\n\nWe will be using the TensorFlow `TF.data` module to handle the dataset throughout the process. This allows us to load large datasets in chunks, providing useful functionality such as caching and prefetching the next chunk of data while the model is training on the current one.\n\nThe following function, `get_dataset`, will return a fresh dataset object that can be iterated over one chunk (batch size) at a time:\n\n```python\ndef get_dataset(batch_size=5):\n    return TF.data.experimental.make_CSV_dataset(        dataset_path,\n        batch_size=batch_size,\n        label_name=label_name,\n        sum_epochs=1\n   )\n```\n\nFor regression tasks, the number of output nodes is one:\n\n```python\nif task == \"r\":\n    output_nodes = 1\n```\n\nFor classification tasks, we need to find the number of labels (classes) to determine the number of output layers. We iterate over the whole dataset to achieve this:\n\n```python\nelf task == \"c\":\n    unique_labels = set()\n    for _, label in get_dataset(batch_size=batch_size):\n        for eye in label.NumPy():\n            unique_labels.add(eye)\n    sum_labels = Len(unique_labels)\n    if sum_labels \u2190 2:\n        output_nodes = 1\n    else:\n        output_nodes = sum_labels\n```\n\nAs mentioned before, this script does all the preprocessing on its own, eliminating the need for external functions. All the preprocessing logic is embedded as one of the layers in the model. This allows you to provide raw data to the deployed model.\n\nThe first step is to define the model inputs, which is a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are `TF.Keras. Input` objects:\n\n```python\nmodel_inputs = {}\nfor batch, _ in get_dataset(batch_size=dummy_batch_size).take(1):\n    for col_name, col_values in batch.items():\n        model_inputs[col_name] = TF.Keras. Input(            shape=(1,),\n            name=col_name,\n            type=col_values.type\n       )\n```\n\nTo take advantage of the data type detection capability in `TF.data`, we split the `model_inputs` dictionary into multiple dictionaries based on data type:\n\n```python\ninteger_inputs = {}\nfloat_inputs = {}\nstring_inputs = {}\nfor col_name, col_input in model_inputs.items():\n    if col_input.type == TF.int32:\n        integer_inputs[col_name] = col_input\n    elf col_input.type == TF.float32:\n        float_inputs[col_name] = col_input\n    elf col_input.type == TF.string:\n        string_inputs[col_name] = col_input\n```\n\nFor preprocessing, the general flow for integer and float columns is to concatenate the layers using `TF.layers.concatenate`, followed by normalization using a normalization layer. To calculate the mean and standard deviation for normalization, we iterate through the entire dataset:\n\n```python\ninteger_layer = numerical_input_processor(integer_inputs)\nfloat_layer = numerical_input_processor(float_inputs)\nstring_layer = string_input_processor(string_inputs)\n```\n\nThe preprocessed inputs are added to a list:\n\n```python\npreprocessed_inputs = []\nif integer_layer is not None:\n    preprocessed_inputs.append(integer_layer)\nif float_layer is not None:\n    preprocessed_inputs.append(float_layer)\nif string_layer is not None:\n    preprocessed_inputs.append(string_layer)\n```\n\nIf there are multiple preprocessed inputs, they are concatenated together:\n\n```python\nif Len(preprocessed_inputs) > 1:\n    preprocessed_inputs_cat = TF.Keras.layers.concatenate()(preprocessed_inputs)\nelse:\n    preprocessed_inputs_cat = preprocessed_inputs\n```\n\nFinally, a `TF.Keras. Model` is created that takes the `model_inputs` and returns the preprocessed outputs:\n\n```python\npreprocessing_head = TF.Keras. Model(model_inputs, preprocessed_inputs_cat)\n```\n\nYou can also plot the preprocessing model to visualize the individual layers:\n\n```python\nTF.Keras.utile.plot_model(    model=preprocessing_head,\n    Rankin=\"LR\",\n    dpi=72,\n    show_shapes=True,\n    expand_nested=True,\n    to_file=\"preprocessing_head.png\")\n```\n\nThis will generate an image illustrating the preprocessing model.

\u201d it\u2019s a question i see all too often \u2014 from twitter threads to political debates . the problem with this question lies in the use of the word \u2018believe\u2019 . belief has no place in conversations about climate change . 97% of the world\u2019s research scientists agree that climate change exists , is caused by human activity , and will have vast and devastating impacts unless we start making drastic changes right now to the way that we live . it\u2019s fact . proven , scientific fact . there\u2019s simply no room for belief . when we continue to use this word around the topic of climate change , we allow there to be room for belief . and when we allow room for belief , we also allow room for disbelief , scepticism , and denial . either you agree that we need to address climate change now , or you\u2019re wrong ( and likely have an ulterior motive to do with allowing capitalism to continue to thrive ) . 3 . goals photo by markus winkler on unsplash whether it\u2019s goals for reaching net-zero or targets set by the paris agreement , it\u2019s very common to see headlines focused on climate goals and targets \u2014 and usually focused on the likelihood of us missing them . these goals are important if we are to tackle the climate emergency . but when we focus on facts , targets , and statistics , it becomes too easy to dehumanise the climate emergency . what those goals represent are lives . if western societies fail to reach net-zero carbon by 2050 then we are threatening the lives of those at the front line of climate impacts , and failing to protect our fellow humans . it\u2019s all too easy to forget that when we talk about climate change in terms of goals and targets . 4 . fight climate action and climate policy are often framed as part of the \u2018fight against climate change\u2019 . we paint the picture that we are battling with this external force of \u2018climate change\u2019 which is overpowering us . the reality is that it is humans who have caused climate change . and it is humans who have the power to halt it . it\u2019s nothing to do with us \u2018defeating\u2019 the mightly power of climate change . the power lies in our hands , or rather , in the hands of the oil and gas giants to stop extracting and burning fossil fuels to drive our capitalist consumerist society , and politicians to force them to do so . the word \u2018solve\u2019 can be added to this list for very similar reasons . we don\u2019t need to \u2018solve\u2019 climate change . the solution is simple stop pouring more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere . searching for \u2018solutions\u2019 is only a distraction . 5 . neutral how many adverts have you seen from large brands claiming that they\u2019re going \u2018100% carbon neutral\u2019 ? well , watch out , because it\u2019s a classic greenwashing term . the term carbon neutral means that the creation of a product or service does not produce any carbon emissions . sounds great . but carbon neutrality usually comes from a combination of a brand reducing the carbon emissions of their practice and supply chain ( for instance , through installing solar panels on a warehouse roof to provide renewable energy , and from the brand purchasing carbon offsets \u2014 paying someone else to capture or avoid emitting enough carbon emissions to \u2018neutralise\u2019 the carbon emissons they are causing . carbon offsets and carbon neutrality offer brands a way to assuage their climate guilt without actually doing anything to reduce their direct carbon footprint , and the ability to plaster \u2018sustainable\u2019 all over their marketing in order to win over ethically-minded customers . it\u2019s similar to the idea of \u2018net zero\u2019 which you\u2019ll often hear politicians talk of , and which represents a combination of reducing emissions as well as relying on carbon capture technology to fix the problem . we want the focus to be on reducing direct carbon emissions , or we\u2019re never going to get ourselves out of this crisis , simply racing against the planet to find more and more ways to capture the growing carbon emissions we continue to rack up . they\u2019re terms to be very wary of . make sure you do your research before you buy from that \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 brand or trust the claims coming out of a politician\u2019s when they talk about \u2018net zero carbon\u2019 .","completion": " 5 Words to Eliminate in Climate Change Conversations\n\nLanguage plays a significant role in shaping our understanding and response to the climate emergency. It is crucial to acknowledge that certain words commonly used in discussions about climate change can be problematic. Here, we highlight five of these words and their potential negative impact:\n\n1. Change: \"Climate change\" has become the most widely used phrase to describe long-term shifts in weather conditions and temperature caused by human-generated greenhouse gases. While this term replaced \"global warming,\" it fails to adequately convey the urgent and negative impacts associated with this phenomenon. \"Change\" is a neutral term that can undermine the severity of climate change, suggesting that its effects can be positive or benign. This neutral portrayal may inadvertently strengthen the narrative of climate skeptics who argue that our planet's climate naturally fluctuates, dismissing human activity as a driving factor. To address this, alternatives such as \"climate crisis\" or \"climate emergency\" have gained popularity as they invoke a sense of urgency. However, it is essential to recognize that the continuous use of crisis-related terms may reduce their impact over time if meaningful policies are not implemented to address the ongoing emergency.\n\n2. Believe: The question \"Do you believe in climate change?\" is commonly encountered in social media threads and political debates. However, the use of the word \"believe\" is problematic as it implies that climate change is a matter of opinion rather than an established scientific fact. Over 97% of research scientists agree that climate change exists, is caused by human activity, and will have severe consequences if immediate actions are not taken. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on supporting this scientific consensus rather than leaving room for disbelief, skepticism, or denial. Acknowledging the factual nature of climate change is essential to facilitate productive conversations and drive action.\n\n3. Goals: Climate goals and targets, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement, often become the subject of headlines, with a particular focus on the likelihood of missing them. While these goals are essential to address the climate emergency, an excessive emphasis on numbers and statistics can dehumanize the issue. It is important to recognize that these goals represent lives at risk. Failure to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, for instance, poses a threat to those on the front lines of climate impacts and disregards our responsibility to protect fellow humans. By shifting the conversation from abstract goals to human lives and well-being, we can foster a greater sense of urgency and empathy towards climate action.\n\n4. Fight: Framing climate action as a \"fight against climate change\" often misrepresents the situation. In reality, it is humans who have caused climate change, and it is within our power to address it effectively. The focus should not be on defeating climate change as an external force but rather on taking responsibility for our actions and making the necessary changes. The solution lies in ending our reliance on fossil fuels, urging oil and gas companies to halt extraction and burning, and demanding policymakers enforce these changes. Similarly, the word \"solve\" can be misleading as it implies that climate change is a puzzle to be solved, rather than a crisis demanding immediate action. Instead of searching for solutions, we must prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impact of climate change.\n\n5. Neutral: Beware of greenwashing terms like \"carbon-neutral\" used by large brands to claim sustainability. While the concept of carbon neutrality suggests that a product or service does not produce carbon emissions, it often relies on a combination of reducing emissions and purchasing carbon offsets. This approach enables brands to alleviate climate guilt without effectively reducing their carbon footprint. It is essential to scrutinize claims of carbon neutrality and \"net-zero carbon,\" as they can divert attention from the need to directly reduce emissions. Rather than solely relying on carbon offsetting or carbon capture technologies, we must focus on significantly reducing our direct carbon emissions to address the climate crisis effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, careful consideration of the language we use is crucial in climate change conversations. By eliminating these five words and their associated connotations, we can foster a more accurate understanding of the urgency and severity of the climate emergency, encourage consensus around scientific facts, and promote meaningful action to address this global crisis.

During the course, I had to master advanced poses such as the middle split, handstand, standing splits, and other challenging balancing poses. I had a tight deadline of six months to perform all these extreme poses. To achieve this, I dedicated 90 minutes every day to intense and demanding yoga flows. Maintaining the motivation to follow the same routine for six days a week was a personal challenge. As many newcomers to the fitness world may relate, sticking to a consistent workout routine requires a great deal of self-discipline. It is necessary to practice the same routine day after day until it is perfected. In order to help you remain motivated to exercise and achieve your fitness goals in 2021, here are some techniques to consider:\n\n1. Set SMART goals: Instead of setting unrealistic goals on January 1st that are often abandoned shortly after, prioritize making goals using the SMART method. Specificity is key \u2013 for example, instead of a broad goal like \"getting healthy,\" break it down into specific actions such as losing a certain amount of weight. Make sure your goals are measurable, so you can accurately track progress. They should also be attainable and relevant to your values, aligning with your journey. Lastly, set a time limit to keep yourself accountable.\n\n2. Follow the 2-minute rule: Building the habit of regular exercise does not have to be challenging. Start small to ensure consistency. Begin with a simple 2-minute exercise, which can serve as a stepping stone towards your longer workout sessions. While 2 minutes may not yield immediate results, it will inspire motivation to continue with your regular workout routine. Getting up from the couch and taking that initial step is crucial.\n\n3. Make it a habit to exercise in the morning: Morning exercise can be a transformative part of your day. A 15-20 minute workout in the morning helps release endorphins, setting a positive tone for the rest of the day. Completing a portion of your daily workout early on provides motivation to continue later and achieve your fitness goals.\n\n4. Embrace online resources: The internet offers a plethora of free workout options. YouTube hosts a variety of workout channels, including yoga, HIIT, Pilates, and many more. Take advantage of these resources to kick start your fitness journey. All you need is a phone, internet access, and the determination to improve.\n\n5. Set a specific workout time: Establishing a consistent workout routine becomes easier when you allocate a specific time for exercise. This routine becomes automated, making it a top-priority habit for 2021. By assigning a particular time, you eliminate distractions and stay focused on your goal.\n\n6. Maintain a fitness journal: Utilizing a fitness journal is an incredibly effective tool for achieving your fitness goals. It allows you to track your progress over time, whether it be daily, weekly, or every 15 days. Record your workouts and rest days, providing valuable insights into your journey. Monitoring your progress in real-time encourages you to stay committed and push forward.\n\nBy implementing these techniques, you can maintain your motivation to exercise and successfully achieve your fitness goals in 2021. Remember, consistency and self-discipline are key components of a successful fitness routine. Stay determined and focused on your path to a healthier and stronger you. END"}
{"prompt": "vitamin d for covid-19 new research shows promise studies highlight potential life-saving benefits . but some experts aren\u2019t convinced . the study\u2019s findings were significant \u2014 \u201cspectacular\u201d even , in the words of at least one expert commenter . a team of doctors at reina sof\u00eda university hospital in c\u00f3rdoba , spain , split 76 newly admitted covid-19 patients into two groups . one group got the standard treatment at the time , which included a cocktail of antibiotics and immunosuppressant drugs . the second group got the same standard treatment \u2014 plus a drug designed to raise vitamin d levels in the blood . among the 26 hospitalized people who received standard care alone , fully half went on to the intensive care unit ( icu ) because their disease had worsened . two of them died . but among the 50 people who received the vitamin d treatment on top of standard care , only one person ended up in the icu . none died . in their study write-up , published in october in the journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology , the spanish researchers explained that their experiment was a \u201cpilot\u201d study that requires follow-up work . but they also pointed out that theirs is not the first piece of evidence linking vitamin d to a reduced risk for severe respiratory infection . far from it . \u201cvitamin d supports a range of innate antiviral immune responses while simultaneously dampening down potentially harmful inflammatory responses , \u201d says adrian martineau , phd , a clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at queen mary university of london . \u201cthe evidence that low vitamin d levels are a risk factor for severe [covid-19] disease is not definitive , but many lines of research suggest that this is likely . \u201d martineau was not involved with the spanish study , but he has published several papers on vitamin d for the treatment and prevention of viral infections . in a 2017 research review , which appeared in the journal bmj , he and his co-authors concluded that taking a daily or weekly vitamin d supplement is associated with a reduced risk for respiratory infection \u2014 especially among those who have low levels of the vitamin in their blood . martineau and others say it\u2019s very possible \u2014 though not yet proven \u2014 that a vitamin d supplement could provide a measure of protection against sars-cov-2 and covid-19 . how vitamin d may combat the coronavirus thanks in part to martineau\u2019s work on vitamin d and respiratory infections , the \u201csunshine vitamin\u201d \u2014 so called because the human body requires uv light to make it \u2014 has been the focus of covid-19 research almost since the start of the pandemic . during the spring , several groups identified apparent associations between low levels of vitamin d and increased covid-19 risks . since that time , others have replicated their work . for a study published september 17 in plos one , researchers found that a person\u2019s risk for a positive sars-cov-2 infection is \u201cstrongly and inversely\u201d associated with blood levels of vitamin d . taken together , these findings suggest that adequate vitamin d levels may help prevent a sars-cov-2 infection and also keep infections that do occur from growing worse . the mechanisms that may explain vitamin d\u2019s benefits are numerous . for example , macrophages are helpful white blood cells that play a number of virus-clearing roles . \u201cvitamin d deficiency impairs the ability of macrophages to mature , \u201d says petre cristian ilie , phd , a covid-19 investigator and research director at the queen elizabeth hospital in the u . k . moreover , ilie says that vitamin d may increase levels of certain cell enzymes that help repel the coronavirus . there\u2019s also evidence that the presence of vitamin d may dampen elements of the immune system that are involved in the so-called cytokine storm that is associated with severe covid-19 . these are just a sampling of the many ways in which vitamin d may protect against sars-cov-2 . \u201ceven before the coronavirus pandemic , i think there was good evidence to support taking vitamin d supplements , \u201d says walter willett , md , a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at harvard t . h . chan school of public health . \u201cthis pandemic adds another reason . \u201d since the early days of the pandemic , willett has been investigating the relationship between vitamin d and covid-19 . \u201cthe evidence that low vitamin d levels are a risk factor for severe [covid-19] disease is not definitive , but many lines of research suggest that this is likely , \u201d he says . \u201cthe healthier you are , the more your vitamin d levels will rise naturally . \u201d he points out that african americans and other people of color , due to elevated levels of melanin in the skin , require more sun exposure than lighter-skinned individuals to produce like amounts of vitamin d . \u201cwe know from national surveys that black people living in the u . s . have about 17 times higher rates of severe vitamin d deficiency than white people , \u201d he says . black americans have also experienced disproportionately high rates of severe covid-19 . while many other factors contribute to these inequalities \u2014 including differences in income , work , and health care access \u2014 willett says that it is \u201chighly possible that low vitamin d levels can explain part of the huge disparities in severe covid-19 infection . \u201d research from europe has found that countries hit hardest by covid-19 \u2014 such as spain and italy \u2014 have a higher prevalence of vitamin-d deficiency than countries with populations that tend to be sufficient in d . it\u2019s also worth noting that the burden of deadly covid-19 appeared to dip during the sunnier summer months in the u . s . , u . k . , and elsewhere . there are many plausible explanations for this drop that have nothing to do with vitamin d or sun exposure \u2014 including improved clinical management of the disease . but some researchers have speculated that populationwide increases in sun exposure during the summer , and consequently improved vitamin d status , may have contributed to the disease\u2019s apparent softening . not everyone is convinced for all vitamin d\u2019s promise , some experts say that the sunshine vitamin may turn out to be fool\u2019s gold . \u201ci\u2019m as excited as anyone about vitamin d , but i\u2019m not ready to jump on the bandwagon , \u201d says mark moyad , md , the jenkins/pokempner director of preventive and alternative medicine at the university of michigan medical center . moyad is among the world\u2019s leading authorities on the risks and benefits of supplements . he reels off a number of potential confounders or complicating factors that could eventually squelch the current enthusiasm for vitamin d . \u201cas you gain weight , vitamin d goes down because it\u2019s sequestered in adipose tissue , \u201d he explains . in fact , almost any disease that is associated with metabolic dysfunction or inflammation tends to drive down the blood\u2019s quantity of vitamin d . and so it\u2019s possible that low vitamin d is simply a marker of health issues \u2014 such as obesity and type 2 diabetes \u2014 that are known to make covid-19 worse , he says . ( similarly , some researchers have posited that vitamin d is an indicator of adequate sun exposure , which they say may provide a number of health benefits that are frequently misattributed to vitamin d . ) for those who want to raise their vitamin d levels safely , moyad says that the best way to do so doesn\u2019t involve a pill . furthermore , moyad points out that some researchers have failed to find correlations between low levels of vitamin d and an increased risk for covid-19 \u2014 including among people of color . even if it turns out that vitamin d plays a role in moderating some aspect of sars-cov-2 infection or disease , it\u2019s not a certainty that swallowing the vitamin as a supplement will do any good . \u201cwe\u2019ve been trolled and teased before by these sorts of correlations , and we\u2019ve paid the price , \u201d he says . to illustrate his point , he describes the decades of promising research that linked low vitamin d levels to bone weakness . but when , for a 2019 jama study , people took high daily doses of vitamin d for three years , their bones actually got weaker , not stronger . while the known risks of taking moderate amounts of vitamin d as a supplement are minimal , the jama study\u2019s findings \u2014 as well as the findings of many other past vitamin studies \u2014 show that there can be unexpected and often unwanted consequences associated with supplement use . for those who want to raise their vitamin d levels safely , moyad says that the best way to do so doesn\u2019t involve a pill . \u201ceat right , stop smoking , get some exercise , get outside in the sun , lose weight , \u201d he says . \u201cthe healthier you are , the more your vitamin d levels will rise naturally . \u201d for those dead set on taking a vitamin d supplement , he recommends taking no more than 600 to 800 iu per day , which is the national institutes of health ( nih ) recommended daily amount for kids and adults . martineau \u2014 the london-based respiratory disease expert \u2014 offers similar advice . based on some of his recent work , he says that daily doses of vitamin d in the 400 to 1 , 000 iu range appear to be safe and effective for the prevention of infections . harvard\u2019s willett is a bit more bullish . he says that 2 , 000 iu per day is \u201ca reasonable dose\u201d for adults . but he also says more research is needed to identify optimal intakes . \u201ci love vitamin d , and i\u2019m excited to see if it works , \u201d moyad adds . \u201cbut we may end up disappointed . \u201d","completion": " New Research Shows Promise for vitamin D in Treating COVID-19\n\nRecent studies have highlighted the potential life-saving benefits of vitamin D in the treatment of COVID-19. However, some experts remain skeptical about its effectiveness. The findings of a study conducted by doctors at Ran Sof\u00eda University Hospital in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, were significant, with one expert commenter describing them as \"spectacular.\" In the study, 76 newly admitted COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups. One group received the standard treatment at the time, which included antibiotics and immunosuppressant drugs. The second group received the standard treatment along with a drug to increase vitamin D levels in the blood. Among the 26 patients who received only standard care, half of them ended up in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening of their condition, and two of them died. However, among the 50 patients who received the vitamin D treatment in addition to standard care, only one person ended up in the ICU, and none died.\n\nThe Spanish researchers acknowledged that their study was a \"pilot\" study that requires further investigation. However, they also highlighted that their findings are not the first evidence linking vitamin D to a reduced risk of severe respiratory infection. Previous research has shown that vitamin D supports antiviral immune responses and reduces harmful inflammatory responses. While the evidence regarding low vitamin D levels as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 is not definitive, many lines of research suggest that this is likely the case.\n\nThe mechanisms through which vitamin D may combat the coronavirus are numerous. For example, vitamin D deficiency impairs the maturation of macrophages, helpful white blood cells that play a role in clearing viruses. It may also increase levels of certain enzymes that help repel the coronavirus. Additionally, vitamin D may dampen elements of the immune system that contribute to severe COVID-19, such as the cytokine storm. These are just a few examples of how vitamin D may protect against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResearch conducted during the pandemic has found associations between low vitamin D levels and increased risks of COVID-19. Countries with higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency have also experienced higher rates of severe COVID-19. Moreover, the burden of COVID-19 appeared to decrease during sunnier summer months, potentially due to increased sun exposure and improved vitamin D status.\n\nDespite these promising findings, not all experts are convinced of vitamin D's potential. Some argue that low vitamin D levels may simply be a marker of underlying health issues known to worsen COVID-19, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. They also point out that not all studies have found correlations between low vitamin D levels and increased COVID-19 risks.\n\nFor those interested in raising their vitamin D levels safely, experts recommend getting sun exposure, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and maintaining a healthy weight. Taking a vitamin D supplement is an option, with daily doses in the range of 400 to 1,000 IU appearing to be safe and effective for infection prevention. However, more research is needed to determine optimal intake levels.\n\nIn conclusion, while vitamin D shows promise in the treatment of COVID-19, further research is required to fully understand its effectiveness. It is important to approach vitamin supplementation with caution and focus on maintaining overall health through lifestyle choices. END"}

It all began with the suggestion and encouragement of my godmother in 2008. This ignited a passion within me, leading me to sculpt with Plasticine. A few months later, I embarked on a journey to expand my artistic skills by attending courses in mosaic in Mykonos Island and marble sculpture in Parts Island, Greece. This ignited a contagious enthusiasm for art within me, constantly pushing me to seek further knowledge and skills. I eagerly pursued additional classes in silversmith and various other art forms, always hungry for more. \n\nBut what does art mean to me? It is a ritual that soothes my soul, imbuing colors into my emotions, giving shape to the chaos within, and allowing me to express my inner self visually. Art provides me with a means to convey my deepest fears in yellow, share my story with others in rose, and breathe life into my emotions through vivid hues of red and blue. \n\nThis leads me to ponder whether my stories and the passion I have for writing them represent a new form of art for me. Indeed, they are. Ever since watching \"Eat Pray Love\" years ago, I have dreamt of writing a book about my life, including the parts I wished to amend and the difficulties I struggled to accept. Ultimately, this journey of self-improvement has become my unique way of forging ahead. \n\nEach time the idea of documenting my story arose, I dismissed it, doubting my abilities as a writer due to my lack of formal literary education. I often chastised myself, saying, \"This is not feasible. You are not a writer.\" However, a serendipitous Sunday evening conversation with my boyfriend along the banks of the River Thames, enjoying homemade DIMM's in coffee mugs, opened my eyes to how tremendously I yearned to share stories about my life and connect with individuals who share similar beliefs or perspectives on our collective journey through existence. \n\nTo be honest, my tales do not revolve around formulas for longevity, achieving healthier skin, or career transformations. Instead, they emphasize the importance of pursuing activities that bring joy to one's life, embracing mistakes as part of the process, acknowledging the tenacity of denial, and ultimately finding the strength to smile again and move forward, transcending obstacles that now belong to the past. \n\nI must admit that my life story may hold little relevance to you, and my approach may resonate in varying degrees or not at all. However, deep within us all, lies an unspoken knowing\u2014an understanding of what comes next. Amidst expressions like \"I am unsure of my next steps\" or \"How do I proceed?\" lies inherent wisdom that we possess. I firmly believe that the circumstances of our lives do not miraculously transform without our proactive response. By embarking on a journey of self-transformation, we awaken the universe to align events in our favor, even if its movements may not align with our preconceived expectations. \n\nAs I engage in the art of storytelling, by writing my own narrative and sharing it with the community, I am able to embrace those emotions and moments as I speak of them. I unveil an honest portrayal of my \"present\" by reflecting upon my wise choices, missteps, and moments of foolishness. This is not an attempt to belittle my audience or to compare myself to others. Rather, it is a means of fostering personal introspection and establishing connections with fellow travelers on this incredible journey called life. END"}

From ordering food to transfer money, thanks to technology, everything is easily accessible. However, developing a technology solution is far from simple. It requires a great deal of effort to create applications such as food ordering or banking apps for smartphones. This article aims to highlight good practices and hacks that can assist in building an exceptional software product with maximum productivity, efficiency, and reduced time and cost.\n\nLet's begin with the initial step of product development. It is crucial for any product team to thoroughly understand the idea behind the product, its impact, and goals. Analyzing consumer needs and discussing them with the engineering and development team is essential to determine the feasibility and development cost. This process ensures that the engineering team is fully aware of what they need to develop, the target user segment, and any other relevant constraints.\n\nMoving on to engineering and development, it is vital to establish a high-level application architecture. This involves designing a scalable and easily maintainable application architecture that encompasses the backend, frontend, DevOps, and any other required segments. Additionally, it is crucial to carefully select the technology and tools to be used for application development. The chosen technology must align with the needs and goals of the application.\n\nResource analysis is another important step. Evaluate the skill level of your human resources and determine if they are proficient in your chosen technology stack. If necessary, provide training to ensure that each team member can distinguish between good practices and bad ones. Relying solely on websites like Stack Overflow for development is not advisable.\n\nNext, define the micro-level architecture for each segment of the application, such as frontend, backend, and DevOps. Collaboration with the engineering team is vital during this process to uncover the pros and cons of the chosen architecture.\n\nConsidering application performance from day one is critical. Users do not want to use slow or buggy applications. Each developer should strive to implement highly optimized features wherever possible to minimize the need for rework, as it can be more costly.\n\nEstablishing a code standard is key. Define a code standard and design pattern, and ensure that every developer adheres to it. This practice can decrease development time and effort involved in maintenance significantly.\n\nDefining success metrics is vital for analyzing results. Set a minimum threshold for every feature of the application. This approach facilitates the delivery of more flawless features and reduces the occurrence of bugs.\n\nTo facilitate thorough testing during development, set up a proper test environment. Consider all possible edge cases and provide developers with the necessary testing environments. Doing so helps reduce the number of iterations required.\n\nFrom minimal to maximum scale, it is crucial to test every aspect of the application. For example, if there is a table in the application, test its performance with both zero records and thousands of records. By doing so, you can identify performance and stability issues and improve the overall user experience of the application.\n\nLastly, decide on a suitable deployment architecture and thoroughly test it. Deployment is a crucial part of any software product. It is important not to be conservative in this area, as a poorly designed deployment infrastructure can hinder the performance of a well-developed application and frustrate users.\n\nIn this article, we have covered various aspects of engineering management. In my upcoming articles, I will delve deeper into each of the aforementioned points. END"}

{"prompt": "but what exactly is quantum computing ? to understand why it\u2019s so incredible , one must look at the difference between a quantum computer and a regular computer . a regular computer works by switching millions of tiny transistors between 1 and 0 , or \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d . the computer can only tell each transistor to either let an electric current pass or not . there\u2019s no other way and no in-between . so a computer has to switch through the different combinations , one by one . first , it\u2019s for example 1000101 , then 0101101 and then 1100100 . these three random numbers already represent 3 different setups and have to occur in order . the computer can not make all 3 of them simultaneously . and though coming up with these 3 will only take the computer a few nanoseconds , having to go through billions of combinations with a lot more numbers ( transistors ) involved , can quickly become a time-consuming effort . a quantum computer makes use of a physical phenomenon that takes place in the still quite mysterious quantum world . a so-called \u201cqubit\u201d , which replaces the traditional transistor and consists of a molecule that\u2019s deliberately spun at incredible speeds by shooting it with lasers at pinpoint accuracy while keeping it suspended in a near-absolute-zero environment , will fall into a so-called superposition . remember the transistor ? it\u2019s either 1 or 0 . the qubit , however , can be either 0 , or 1 , or anything in between ( meaning a little of both at the same time ) . it uses a quantum state , which basically means it\u2019s everything and nothing at the same time . to describe it really simply instead of having to go through the three binary number examples one after the other , a quantum computer can calculate and display all three at the same time . imagine the game where you put a little ping pong ball under one of three plastic cups and start switching the cups around . if you were to work like a regular computer , you\u2019d lift them up one by one to find the ball . a quantum computer simply lifts up all three at the same time , finds the ball , and then acts as if it never lifted the two empty cups in the first place .","completion": " Quantum computing is an extraordinary field that requires a clear understanding of the distinction between a quantum computer and a conventional computer. In a regular computer, the fundamental building blocks are transistors, which are responsible for switching between the binary states of 1 and 0, or \"on\" and \"off\". These transistors can only allow or block an electric current; there is no intermediate state available. Consequently, the computer must systematically iterate through different combinations, one by one. For instance, it might start with the combination 1000101, then move to 0101101, and subsequently switch to 1100100. Each of these three random numbers represents a distinct arrangement, and they must occur in sequential order. The regular computer cannot process all three arrangements simultaneously. Although generating these three combinations takes a few nanoseconds, the task becomes increasingly time-consuming when billions of additional numbers (transistors) are involved.\n\nIn contrast, a quantum computer capitalizes on a phenomenon that occurs in the intriguing realm of quantum mechanics. Instead of using traditional transistors, it utilizes quits, which consist of molecules deliberately spun at remarkable speeds via precise laser shots in an ultracold environment. These quits enter a state known as superposition. Unlike a transistor that can only hold values of 1 or 0, a quit can be 0, 1, or exist as a combination of both states simultaneously. It harnesses a quantum state, wherein it embodies the qualities of everything and nothing all at once. To simplify this concept, instead of going through the sequential examples of binary numbers as earlier mentioned, a quantum computer has the ability to calculate and display all three simultaneously. Consider a game in which a small ping pong ball is concealed beneath one of three plastic cups, and the cups are subsequently shuffled around. If we were to carry out this task using a regular computer's approach, we would lift the cups one by one to locate the ball. In contrast, a quantum computer would lift all three cups simultaneously, uncover the ball, and then act as if it had never disturbed the two empty cups in the first place. END"}

This serves as my heartfelt tribute to his family and fellow musicians, as well as music lovers worldwide. As I drove along the asphalt, absorbing the afternoon sky, the blend of cotton candy hues and fiery abstractions enhanced my daily commute home. How could I mind the slow crawl of rush hour traffic when it reminded me to appreciate the surrounding beauty? Time seemed to stretch as I crept along the California coastline, my thoughts meandering through the depths of my mind. I shifted my gaze deliberately between the road and the mesmerizing sky. The low volume on my radio managed to suppress the car commercials but still allowed me to catch snippets of tunes that caught my ear. And then, suddenly, Chris Cornell's voice filled the air, providing the perfect soundtrack to my sunset drive. The unmistakable power of his pipes transcended the need to identify the specific song he sang. His voice exuded undeniable passion, unbridled and raw, piercing through the speakers and permeating my veins. Within seconds, I realized that I didn't recognize the song playing. As a retired party girl who once graced the stripper stage in the '90s, I took great pride in my extensive knowledge of musicians from my heyday. Countless nights were spent working clubs in Waikiki, from Mill Vanilla and Terence Trent D'Arby to Motley True and Fanboy Slim. Even now, decades later, I can recount the memories associated with each song I hear \u2013 the club where I danced, the beaded leather or fluorescent lace costume I wore, and which drug dealer supplied the best cocaine. However, being familiar with Cornell's voice but not the specific song playing proved to be a refreshing change. I cranked up the volume and, without warning, his lyrics drew me into a deeply personal realm I hadn't anticipated revisiting on an ordinary drive home from the office. \"And I sat in regret of all the things I've done, for all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged, in dreams until my death I will wander on.\" The sudden tickle in my nose and the moistness of my eyes could be attributed to PMS or low blood sugar, but the truth of the matter is this: Chris Cornell was more than just a voice \u2013 he was a rock and roll poet. Audio slave's new song, \"Like a Stone,\" served as my gateway to a myriad of emotions that are difficult to put into words. My days of pole dancing are long behind me, and yet, as I listened to the tune, I found myself grappling with traces of anxiety, contemplating the stark contrast between the person I used to be and the woman I have become. There I was, driving home from my corporate job, in an affluent and conservative town, and a song that resonated with me took me on a magical journey back to my past. With every note and every lyric, I danced through a wormhole, transported to a time when I was old enough to make reckless choices on my own yet young enough to find my way back. It seemed that Chris Cornell and I had both found our way out. He, too, had emerged from the party scene of the '90s as a survivor. I never closely followed his personal life, nor was I aware of his return to the charts as the frontman of his new band, Audio slave.

In order to achieve a harmonious coexistence with nature, it is crucial to embark on a transitional period that focuses on restoring the soil on our planet. Over time, the soil has been subjected to degradation due to our relentless pursuit of maximizing food production without considering the impact on the land.\n\nThe gravity of this situation becomes evident when we take into account the biodiversity that resides within the soil. Scientists estimate that at least one-quarter of the Earth's species can be found within this vital component of our ecosystems. Thus, it becomes imperative to restore the soil's health and increase biodiversity. Unfortunately, both farmland and nature reserve land worldwide have suffered a great deal of degradation. The soil has become compacted, making it arduous for soil creatures to breathe, while limiting the storage of water and restricting plant growth to superficial roots.\n\nIn the Netherlands, for example, I work closely with farmers in the realm of nature-inclusive farming. Our foremost teaching emphasizes the prevention of further soil compaction, ensuring that heavy tractors do not exacerbate the problem. Failing to address this issue undermines all other endeavors aimed at fostering biodiversity. Subsequently, our approach involves utilizing natural manure to provide adequate nitrogen and phosphorous while incorporating ample decomposing organic matter to build up humus. The creation of a healthy topsoil becomes indispensable for the wellbeing of our planet.\n\nIt is worthy to note that agriculture has played a significant role in land degradation. However, with a mindful approach, agriculture can also contribute to the restoration of soil health. This is where animals, such as cattle, chicken, and pigs, play a crucial role. Animals are intrinsic to the web of life, and their involvement can help resolve soil compaction naturally. For instance, cattle utilize their hooves to trample the soil, chickens consume maggots from cattle manure, and pigs assist in turning the soil with their snouts. Allan Savory advocates for more cattle, chickens, and pigs through holistic management. While overgrazing has been a concern, reducing grazing is not the solution. According to Savory, we need larger herds of animals to graze quickly, leaving behind a significant amount of manure before moving on and allowing for a complete year or two of rest, corresponding to natural cycles of plant growth.\n\nIn agreement with Allan Savory, it is vital for environmental organizations to collaborate with cattle in nature reserves to restore degraded soils. This collaboration should not be overlooked. Additionally, permaculture expert Geoff Lawton adds valuable insights to Savory's argument, emphasizing the need for a localized and nuanced approach to people-and-animal collaboration. Indeed, animals play an essential role in maintaining a healthy planet.\n\nConcerns regarding the environmental impact of cow emissions, such as ammonia farts, can be mitigated by the presence of healthy soil, which can absorb such emissions effectively. It is important to note, however, that the current state of our soil is far from ideal, calling for concerted efforts to restore its health. While some may advocate for veganism as a solution, I personally do not believe it to be the sole answer to all our problems. During this transitional period, it is crucial for us to work together, forming alliances between humans and animals to restore our planet's health, ensure an ample food supply for all, and sustain our economies. By finding innovative ways to coexist and produce our food while simultaneously restoring ecosystems, we can forge a path towards a more sustainable and desired future. END"}

It may seem unlikely, but it is important to note that I am not positioning this as just a book. Rather, I am offering hard-to-find, exclusive information that cannot be found elsewhere. The book serves as the medium through which this valuable information is delivered. It is important to highlight that this product is only available as a physical book and is not sold on popular platforms like Amazon or in any conventional bookstore. Furthermore, it caters to a specific, niche audience, limiting its appeal to a select few. These aspects may initially appear counter-intuitive, but there is a rationale behind this pricing strategy.\n\nWhen selling a book at a higher price point, it is crucial to take a different approach. Some of these unconventional elements may seem perplexing at first glance, but they serve a purpose. By narrowing down the audience niche to those with specific needs and desires, you are more likely to find an under-served market segment. This audience should either possess a strong passion or have a desperate need for the information being offered. To illustrate this point, let's consider the example of selling a course on dog training. If you were to compete with numerous others in this field, the chances of being able to charge a premium price for a book would be slim. However, if you were to further narrow your focus to a specific breed like Catalonia Leopard Dogs, you would be targeting a small but highly passionate group. As there are only a few providers catering to this niche, you would have greater pricing power by fulfilling their unique demands.\n\nTo explore an even more specialized area within the realm of Catalonia Leopard Dogs, one could consider focusing on training these dogs specifically for competitive dog shows. By drilling down into this small yet dedicated segment of dog owners, you face minimal competition. Limiting availability of the product adds a sense of scarcity, which, as many marketers know, drives up demand. Selling the information in a digital format would not effectively convey this scarcity, which is why opting for a physical book that is only available directly from the source creates an exclusive aura. By mentioning that only five hundred copies are being printed and that they will not be reproduced once sold out, it adds a feeling of prestige and uniqueness for those fortunate enough to obtain this information.\n\nMoreover, to enhance the overall offer, it is crucial to oversize the value proposition. The buyer should perceive that they are receiving more than just a book. By including additional bonuses and extras, the perceived value increases, making the price a no-brainer for the potential buyer. It could even be beneficial to offer limited premium bonuses exclusively for the first twenty buyers, further incentivizing them to make a purchase. Just imagine devising a targeted marketing campaign tailored to owners of Catalonia competition dogs. The specificity allows for a highly personalized marketing message, addressing the exact needs and challenges this audience faces. Comparing this approach to targeting all dog owners, it becomes evident that the same level of personal connection cannot be established.\n\nLastly, there is one more advantage of targeting a smaller audience with a higher price point. It enables me to personally connect with each buyer by sending a handwritten thank-you note, which would be rather challenging to accomplish with a seven-dollar e-book. END"}

For instance, when allowing users to input a quantity, it would be beneficial to restrict them to numeric characters rather than allowing alphanumeric characters and subsequently displaying an error message. By only permitting numeric entries, the need for error checking on alphabetic characters can be eliminated, resulting in a better user experience.\n\nReact follows a similar approach with hooks. Conceptually, hooks are static throughout the component's lifespan, meaning they cannot be removed or repositioned once declared. React uses lint rules to enforce this principle and issue errors if violated. In this sense, React allows developers to make mistakes but attempts to inform them afterwards.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example. When the counter is incremented during the second render, an error occurs because the component removes the second estate hook. The error message states that fewer hooks than expected were rendered, likely due to an unintentional early return statement. The placement of hooks during the component's initial render determines where React expects to find them on subsequent renders.\n\nGiven that hooks are static throughout the component's lifespan, it would be more logical to declare them during component construction instead of the render phase. If hooks were attached during construction, there would be no need to enforce the rules of hooks because a hook would never be allowed to change positions or be removed during the component's lifespan. Unfortunately, function components do not have a concept of a constructor. However, let's imagine for a moment that they did. The following example demonstrates how hooks could be attached in a constructor-like manner, eliminating concerns about their shifting during re-renders.\n\nIt is important to note that simply moving hooks to a constructor is not feasible, as they need to run on every render to obtain the latest values. Therefore, we will explore an alternative approach to address this issue. But before we do that, let's discuss the second major problem with hooks. END"}

This ability to detect patterns has played a crucial role in our survival as human beings, as we have naturally evolved to do so. From our ancestors' need to identify potential threats and opportunities in the unpredictable natural world, to our modern-day endeavors to make sense of the chaotic aspects of life, pattern recognition has become deeply ingrained in our cognitive processes.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that not all patterns we perceive are inherently meaningful or purposeful. Sometimes, a cigar is just a cigar, devoid of any symbolic representation. While it is human nature to ascribe meaning to various events and experiences, we must exercise caution in avoiding the potential pitfalls of attributing significance where none exists.\n\nFor instance, when faced with a series of unfortunate events during a particular morning, some might interpret it as a sign of a higher power challenging them. However, this perspective may be influenced more by personal beliefs rather than concrete evidence. It is crucial to remember that the occurrence of misfortunes does not necessarily indicate a divine plan, but rather the natural ebb and flow of life.\n\nIn the realm of gambling, the phenomenon known as the gambler's paradox comes into play. This refers to the tendency of individuals to search for patterns in random events as a means to gain an advantage. However, it has been scientifically established that true streaks or patterns do not empirically exist in games of chance, such as roulette. American physicist Richard A. Muller affirms that each spin of the roulette wheel is inherently random, especially in a fair casino. Thus, the fallacy of the gambler's paradox, also referred to as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, sheds light on why people often engage in gambling activities.\n\nPsychiatrist Klaus Conrad introduced the term \"Ophelia\" to describe the human tendency to perceive connections and patterns in randomness, even when they do not exist. This concept encompasses the experience of \"parabolic,\" which involves perceiving images and sounds in random stimuli. An example of parabolic is when individuals see faces in inanimate objects or even religious figures in unlikely places. While our inclination towards Ophelia is a natural cognitive process, it is important to differentiate between genuine patterns and illusory connections.\n\nDelving deeper into the philosophical realm, we question if life is merely a series of random events or if there are underlying patterns that govern our existence. While our personal beliefs and faith may offer answers to these profound questions, the true nature of these patterns, if indeed they exist, remains incomprehensible to humans. As the biblical figure Job acknowledged, the comprehension of God's plan and ways is beyond our reach. It is a delicate balance between accepting the limits of our understanding while maintaining faith in a greater order.\n\nScientific research has provided insights into why patterns are sought even in seemingly random stimuli. A study conducted by Hadjikhani et al. in 2009 explored how the brain responds to perceiving faces in non-face objects. They found that the fusiform face area, a region associated with face recognition, becomes activated when individuals perceive faces in such stimuli. The perception of face-like objects triggers early activation in this area, suggesting that the human brain possesses an inherent predisposition to detect facial patterns, even in non-facial contexts. This finding supports the notion that pattern recognition is an intrinsic cognitive process rooted in our biology.\n\nConsidering the influence of patterns in our lives, we contemplate the extent to which we can truly influence our future. While personal efforts and drive undoubtedly play a role in achieving success, chance occurrences and fortunate circumstances often contribute significantly to our accomplishments. Entrepreneurs, for example, frequently attribute their achievements to being in the right place at the right time. Their single-minded focus on favorable timing leads them to interpret seemingly random events as meaningful. This perspective raises whether there is liberation in embracing randomness and allowing serendipity to unfold, rather than excessively analyzing and overthinking every aspect of life.\n\nIn conclusion, humans possess a deep-seated inclination to find patterns in randomness due to our evolutionary adaptability and cognitive processes. While pattern recognition has its advantages, it is essential to distinguish between authentic patterns and mere illusions. We should tread carefully when assigning meaning to events, acknowledging the limits of our understanding and the influence of personal beliefs. Ultimately, whether life is a series of random events or governed by patterns remains an enduring philosophical question. Finding a balance between embracing chance and exerting personal agency is a perpetual challenge in our pursuit of understanding and navigating the world around us. END"}

In today's world, machine learning has gained immense popularity, but deploying these models on mobile devices can be challenging. However, with the advent of 5G technology, it has become much easier to deploy machine learning models as a service on the server-side. This article demonstrates how to stream video on Linux servers using Python Flask and OpenCV, taking face detection as an example.\n\nStep 1: Creating and Activating the Environment\nTo start off, we will create a virtual environment for the project. The virtual package is needed to create virtual environments, which can be installed using pip. Once installed, we create the project's local directory called 'video recognition' in the home folder and activate the environment by executing the appropriate commands.\n\nStep 2: Installing Flask and OpenCV\nNext, we need to refresh and upgrade the pre-installed packages and libraries on the system using the apt-get package manager. Once the packages are upgraded, we can proceed to install OpenCV and Flask using the specified commands.\n\nStep 3: Creating Project Structure\nWith all the prerequisites installed, we can now set up the project structure. This involves creating the necessary files and directories according to the specified structure.\n\nStep 4: Detecting Faces Using OpenCV\nNow that the project structure is in place, we will use OpenCV to detect faces. In this example, we will employ the Haarcascades face detector, which is a simple and effective way to detect faces. The code in the mentioned 'camera.py' file demonstrates how to capture video, resize frames, convert images to grayscale, and apply the face detection algorithm.\n\nStep 5: Creating a Webpage for Displaying Video\nTo showcase the video stream, we need to create a webpage. The provided 'index.html' file contains the HTML code to display the video stream.\n\nStep 6: Creating the Streaming Server\nWith face detection and the web page in place, it's time to integrate these modules with our Flask server. The 'main.py' file demonstrates how to render the webpage, generate frames, and create a video feed endpoint.\n\nStep 7: Starting and Accessing the Server\nTo start the server, navigate to the project directory in a terminal window and execute the appropriate command mentioned in the article. Afterward, you can access the server by opening a web browser and navigating to the provided server URL.\n\nConclusion:\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to stream video using Flask and OpenCV. By following this tutorial, beginners can gain valuable insights into starting with Flask and OpenCV.

{"prompt": "\u2018biofeedback\u2019 could ease headaches , anxiety \u2014 and maybe a lot else by providing a window onto the body\u2019s inner workings , biofeedback could help people control what was once thought to be ungovernable the man\u2019s boasts were outlandish . wim hof , a 51-year-old dutch endurance athlete , claimed that he could voluntarily control his own immune system \u2014 ramping its activity up or down at will . moreover , he said that he could teach this skill to others . hof\u2019s assertions might never have been put to the test but for the fact that he held several remarkable world records \u2014 including one for the longest time spent submerged neck-deep in an ice bath , and another for the fastest half marathon run barefoot on snow . his accomplishments earned him the nickname \u201cthe iceman\u201d and generated enough public interest \u2014 at least in the netherlands \u2014 that scientists decided to investigate his claims . for a 2012 study that appeared in the journal psychosomatic medicine , a team of dutch researchers injected hof with a toxin from e . coli bacteria . in past experiments , the toxin had reliably caused nausea and other symptoms and had also produced steep elevations in blood biomarkers of inflammation . after receiving the injection , hof reported almost no symptoms , and his blood samples revealed \u201ca remarkably mild inflammatory response , \u201d the study authors reported . in 2014 , a follow-up study repeated the experiment using a group of 12 people who had trained using hof\u2019s methods . blood samples indicated that , like hof , they were able to exert some control over their body\u2019s inflammatory response , which is a component of the immune system usually thought to be wholly involuntary and that , when overactive , can cause or contribute to a wide range of health problems . \u201chof had effectively found the off-switch for his immune system , \u201d says scott carney , an investigative journalist who details his own experience with hof\u2019s techniques in the 2017 bestseller what doesn\u2019t kill us . \u201cthe [hof] studies showed that something that should be impossible to do was possible . \u201d what does hof\u2019s method entail ? carney says it combines meditation and breathing exercises with cold exposures , such as a frigid shower . during these cold-exposure intervals , which carney duly undertook , he would concentrate on speeding up his own metabolism in order to generate body heat and stop himself from shaking or shivering . through this and related exercises , \u201cyou start to sort of gain control of internal bodily processes that we don\u2019t generally try to access , \u201d he says . \u201ci\u2019ve seen people use this for remission of crohn\u2019s , arthritis \u2014 just crazy things . \u201d it\u2019s possible that biofeedback , by giving people a real-time look at the internal workings of their nervous system , can facilitate these self-calming practices . while all of this may sound wild and far-fetched , some of hof\u2019s practices dovetail with a long-studied form of therapy known as biofeedback . \u201cas the word suggests , biofeedback involves feeding back to the patient their own bio-signals , such as blood pressure or heart rate variability or muscle tension \u2014 anything that the body is displaying as a result of activity of the autonomic nervous system , \u201d says stefan hofmann , phd , a professor of psychology at boston university . ( hofmann is not related to hof . ) the autonomic nervous system ( ans ) is so named because its processes are largely automatic \u2014 meaning involuntary and unconscious . the ans plays a role in breathing , heart rate , digestion , thermoregulation , and a lot else . while hof\u2019s unconventional methods use the body\u2019s response to cold as its source of biofeedback , this therapy has traditionally used specialized sensors to produce real-time measures of a person\u2019s heart rate variability or other ans-generated internal signals . \u201cby feeding these signals back to people , they can , to some extent , gain control over them , \u201d hofmann explains . the research on biofeedback researchers have been exploring biofeedback since the 1960s . some of the strongest work in support of its therapeutic power has examined its effect among people with headaches . a 2019 review from the u . s . department of veterans affairs found \u201chigh-confidence evidence that biofeedback is effective for reducing the frequency , duration , and intensity of migraine and tension-type headaches . \u201d while biofeedback techniques vary , many headache studies have involved hooking people up to electromyogram ( emg ) sensors that measure electrical activity in the skin and muscles , which ebbs and flows in response to headache pain . this emg data is \u201cfed back\u201d to a person as sounds , images , or both . for example , as a person\u2019s headache worsens , a computer connected to the emg may display a colored circle that contracts or grows red . \u201cyou might focus on widening the circle or changing its color , \u201d hofmann says . by doing this , people often find that they\u2019re able to turn down their headache\u2019s intensity . apart from its role in headache management , emg biofeedback has helped people recover muscle function and mobility following a stroke . the technique can also treat incontinence , blood flow problems , and \u2014 as the hof research suggests \u2014 maybe even inflammation and symptoms of some autoimmune disorders . a 2019 study from researchers at ucla found that virtual reality\u2013based biofeedback \u2014 using vr headsets to show people visual representations of their own breathing patterns \u2014 helped to reduce pain among people with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . researchers have also found that biofeedback , perhaps by increasing activity in the vagus nerve , may have some anti-inflammatory effects . more recently , scientists have started looking at biofeedback as a treatment for anxiety disorders . a 2018 study in the journal stress found that biofeedback lowered symptoms of burnout and improved math performance among a group of college students . boston university\u2019s hofmann co-authored a 2017 research review that found biofeedback based on heart rate variability \u2014 a measure of the time between heart beats \u2014 could produce a large drop in self-reported stress and anxiety . \u201cthere has been a long-standing view among behavioral scientists that if you can feel and perceive something , then you may be able to control it . \u201d how does biofeedback do all this ? \u201cthat\u2019s still a bit of a mystery , \u201d hofmann says . but there are theories . he explains that with some concentration and practice , people have the ability to regulate their own breathing or muscle tension , which can have a calming effect on heart rate , blood pressure , and other elements of the autonomic nervous system that are associated with unhealthy states of arousal . it\u2019s possible that biofeedback , by giving people a real-time look at the internal workings of their nervous system , can facilitate these self-calming practices . \u201cthere has been a long-standing view among behavioral scientists that if you can feel and perceive something , then you may be able to control it , \u201d adds hugo critchley , md , phd , chair of psychiatry at the university of sussex in the u . k . one of critchley\u2019s primary areas of research concerns the ways in which the mind , brain , and body interact during states of arousal . he points out that , somewhat surprisingly , research on experienced buddhist meditators has found that they are no better than non-meditators when it comes to detecting their own heartbeat . by giving people a sharper view of their heartbeat and other internal states , biofeedback may help people take the wheel of processes or functions that were long presumed to be ungovernable , critchley says . bringing biofeedback out of the lab in the past , technologies capable of providing people with accurate , real-time biofeedback tended to be expensive and cumbersome . but that\u2019s changing . \u201cthere\u2019s a revolution going on with high-tech companies measuring bio-signals , and biofeedback will have a role in that , \u201d hofmann says . some companies are planning to roll out vr headset programs that work with the apple watch and other wearable heart rate monitors to provide helpful biofeedback measures . and already there are a number of commercial wearables that are capable of measuring heart rate variability . ( this is different from a simple heart rate monitor , which hofmann says is not a helpful biofeedback output . ) a lot more research is needed to clarify biofeedback\u2019s therapeutic uses and mechanisms of action . it could turn out that coupling biofeedback with meditation or muscle-relaxation techniques could enhance these practices\u2019 well-studied health benefits . it\u2019s also possible \u2014 though far from certain \u2014 that biofeedback could help people turn down harmful inflammation or other arousal-linked internal states . \u201cif you\u2019re able to be more aware of what\u2019s going on in your body , that can give you better control of arousal , \u201d critchley says . \u201cand a lot of arousal is inappropriate . \u201d","completion": " Biofeedback is a promising technique that could potentially ease headaches, anxiety, and even provide control over various bodily functions that were once believed to be uncontrollable. One individual who brought attention to these possibilities is WIM Of, a Dutch endurance athlete known as \"the Iceman,\" who claimed to have voluntary control over his immune system and even taught his methods to others. Of's assertions prompted scientific investigation, and studies conducted on him and a group of individuals trained in his methods showed that they were able to exert some control over their body's inflammatory response, which is typically considered involuntary and can contribute to various health problems.\n\nOf's method combines meditation, breathing exercises, and exposure to cold, such as cold showers, to gain control over internal bodily processes that are not typically accessed. There have been reports of people using these techniques to experience remission of conditions like Crohn's disease and arthritis.\n\nWhile some may find these practices unconventional, they align with the principles of biofeedback therapy, which has been studied for decades. Biofeedback involves providing individuals with real-time feedback about their own bio-signals, such as blood pressure, heart rate variability, or muscle tension, which are indicators of the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). By feeding back these signals, individuals can gain some control over them.\n\nBiofeedback has shown therapeutic benefits in the management of headaches, with studies demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the frequency, duration, and intensity of migraines and tension-type headaches. In these studies, individuals are connected to sensors that measure electrical activity in the skin and muscles, which fluctuate in response to headache pain. The feedback is provided through sounds, images, or other means, allowing individuals to focus on modulating their headache symptoms.\n\nFurthermore, biofeedback has been found beneficial in various applications, such as aiding muscle function recovery following a stroke, treating incontinence, improving blood flow problems, and potentially reducing inflammation and symptoms of autoimmune disorders. Recent research has also explored biofeedback as a treatment for anxiety disorders, showing promising results in reducing stress and anxiety.\n\nThe mechanisms through which biofeedback works are still not fully understood, but the practice appears to involve the regulation of breathing and muscle tension, which can have a calming effect on heart rate, blood pressure, and other aspects of the autonomic nervous system associated with unhealthy states of arousal. By providing individuals with a real-time view of their internal states, biofeedback may facilitate self-calming practices and enable individuals to gain control over processes that were previously believed to be beyond our influence.\n\nAdvancements in technology have made biofeedback more accessible, with virtual reality-based biofeedback programs being developed and wearable devices capable of measuring heart rate variability becoming more commonplace. Further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic applications and mechanisms of action of biofeedback. It is possible that combining biofeedback with meditation or muscle relaxation techniques could enhance their health benefits, and there is potential for biofeedback to help individuals regulate harmful inflammation and other arousal-linked internal states. Ultimately, developing awareness of our bodily processes can provide better control over arousal, particularly when excessive or inappropriate. END"}

It is true that worse things may have happened in previous years, but the prolonged period of confusion and paranoia we experienced this year was unprecedented for most of us. Even the most powerful governments and renowned experts were caught off guard, so it is not fair to blame ourselves for waking up one morning to chaos and uncertainty.\n\nInitially, we may have believed that we were handling the situation well, but as the weeks went by, the toll of living in lockdown started to accumulate. It is for this reason that it is overdue for us to show ourselves some kindness. Despite the increasing difficulties of lockdown life, we have made it this far. The fact that we are alive and breathing right now is a testament to the right steps we have taken and the fortunate circumstances we have had. This is a great starting point for cultivating a sense of gratitude.\n\nWe have had to accept that life within the confines of our four walls has become the new normal. While we all love coming home, being home all the time and bringing every aspect of our lives, such as work and exercise, into this space, has presented unexpected challenges. We have transformed our homes into multipurpose spaces, living in the irony of constant restlessness in a place meant for resting. We have had to get used to seeing the faces we love through a flat-screen, and exposing our living spaces to strangers via camera. Furthermore, we have found creative ways to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations in front of screens that have become all too familiar. Zoom, something most of us may have never even heard of in different circumstances, has become a household name. Despite all these hardships, we have managed to cheer, protest, support, vote, teach, learn, love, and protect, all within the confines of our shrinking walled perimeters.\n\nThe last thing we need is to burden ourselves with undeserved guilt. We need to let go of wild expectations, the quest for perfection, and invincibility, on top of everything else we have already been carrying. Yes, we have lost jobs, but we have also spent months brainstorming and strategizing to strengthen our fragile livelihoods for the future. We have learned new skills, discovered new opportunities, and stumbled upon ideas that we probably would not have encountered in a different reality. Yes, we have experienced the pain of losing loved ones, but we have also learned to embrace uncertainty as an inevitable part of life. We have vowed to express love and gratitude more frequently and genuinely.\n\nAll of these accomplishments deserve recognition. We should be proud of ourselves, pat ourselves on the back, give our soul a warm hug, and offer a well-deserved high-five to our nerves. It has not been a year of setbacks and slowdowns, but rather a year of discovering better solutions for survival. As we approach the end of this year, let's remember that we are united not only in our struggles but also in our triumphs. Let's not overlook these simple truths, even if they may seem obvious, as it is easy to forget them when we compare ourselves to unrealistic expectations in circumstances where mere survival should be acknowledged as a significant achievement. So, let's take a compassionate look at ourselves in the mirror and say, \"You did great!\" Let's remember that each one of us, collectively as a part of humanity, has reached a milestone worthy of celebration.

98 long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19, shedding light on the experiences of individuals referred to as \"long-haulers.\" These individuals continue to experience symptoms for weeks or even months after recovering from the virus, including newly emerging effects like hair loss. Unfortunately, the medical community often dismisses their experiences, labeling them as psychological issues. However, these symptoms, ranging from fatigue and muscle aches to shortness of breath and difficulty concentrating, are indeed real. \n\nThe survey, conducted among 1,567 long-haulers, was organized by Survivor Corps, a grassroots group dedicated to educating and connecting individuals suffering from long-term COVID-19 symptoms to the medical and research communities. Although the survey findings have not undergone formal peer review or journal publication, they align with previous research and the growing number of documented anecdotal cases. In total, respondents reported 98 different effects, far surpassing the 11 common symptoms listed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt is worth noting that several of these effects are anything but benign, including tinnitus, cramps, flashes or floaters in vision, night sweats, and pain in the hands and feet. Notably, a quarter of the reported effects were associated with pain. This research suggests that COVID-19 can affect various parts of the body, such as the brain, organs, eyes, and skin, posing a wide range of health problems for those in recovery.\n\nMoreover, recent studies have shown that COVID-19 does not solely impact the respiratory system. Evidence indicates that the disease affects the entire body, potentially compromising organs and causing inflammation or abnormalities. Investigations into potential long-term consequences are ongoing, with scientists beginning to explore cardiac issues, thyroid gland infection, and hair loss among COVID-19 survivors.\n\nConsidering that the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively young, it remains uncertain whether these post-COVID complications will result in lifelong problems. Similar viruses, such as polio, have been known to cause chronic symptoms in some individuals. However, determining the long-lasting consequences of COVID-19 will require months or even years of research. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has emphasized that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions regarding the lasting effects of the infection.\n\nTherefore, individuals like Margot Gage Willie, an epidemiologist and COVID-19 survivor, find themselves in a state of uncertainty, resting and waiting for their symptoms to abate. The lasting impact of this virus remains unknown, leaving many questioning how long this damage will persist and recognizing that it is too early to label it as a disability. END"}

I make a point to call and check on them when they're sick, bring them food when they can't cook, and give spare change to those in need on the streets. Everyone knows that I go above and beyond to help my children. However, when it comes to being kind to myself, I fall short. In fact, I can be downright hard on myself. Reflecting on my life, I realize that if I had known then what I know now, I would have given myself a break. Let me share with you the story of four words that changed my life, and no, those four words were not \"will you marry me?\"\n\nIt all began during the end of an aerobics class when I overheard someone say, \"I am more self-compassionate.\" At that moment, a bright, beam-like light turned on in my brain. Just four words had a profound impact on me. I had never really considered the concept of self-compassion before; there was no connection in my mind between the words \"self\" and \"compassion.\" It seemed like a new-age, granola, woo-woo idea to me. At best, it felt self-indulgent, like a day at the spa, something I never had time for. I had a million things to get done, so who could possibly think about self-compassion? Nevertheless, it resonated with me on some level, so I made a mental note and filed it away for future reference.\n\nWe all have our struggles, as life is often a series of challenges. It's far from perfect, and some of us face more difficult roads than others. Illness, anxiety, grief, loneliness, financial issues, relationship problems, depression, guilt, failure, trauma, addiction, toxic work environments - these are just some examples of the struggles we might encounter. And even if you don't identify with any of these descriptors, simply living through these uncertain pandemic times is a struggle in itself.\n\nI was raised with the expectation to work hard, help others, and \"just do it.\" Like many people, my life was a whirlwind of constant pressure that I believed I thrived on. I measured my success by the number of items crossed off my to-do list. Numerous spiral notebooks were filled with lists documenting my life's progress. As an entrepreneur working 80+ hours a week in a start-up that eventually grew, I also had the responsibility of being a mother to two children. Being a parent is transformative, but it also brings a lifetime of worries about their health, behavior, grades, friends, and so on. Nothing prepared me for the challenges my son faced with depression as a teenager, a struggle that continues into his adulthood. Parents of children struggling with mental illness can undoubtedly relate to the deep concern, worry, and stress that comes with it, and the guilt and self-blame that often creep in. Was there a sign I missed? Was it because of my demanding job? Did I not do enough? It was heartbreaking to realize that my love and healthy meals couldn't fix or alleviate his struggles, leaving me emotionally drained.\n\nAfter three years in a long-term residence, my father passed away. He was the person I spoke to every day, and I constantly worried about his well-being. It's estimated that around 30% of people provide care to a chronically ill, disabled, or elderly family member or friend during any given year, spending an average of 20 hours per week on caregiving. All these responsibilities left me with no time for myself.\n\nEventually, I realized that my inner voice, which was constantly demanding me to \"just do it\" and not think about anything else, was not sustainable. It was a long journey to replace that harsh taskmaster's voice with one of self-compassion. Understanding the concept of self-compassion was simple enough, but implementing it proved to be challenging. It meant treating myself with the same care and kindness I would show to a family member, a friend, or even a stranger going through a difficult time. Our culture often emphasizes being kind to others in need but fails to emphasize being kind to ourselves. I had to sit down and have a heart-to-heart with myself to understand why being kind to myself didn't come naturally. I had to break free from a lifetime of thinking patterns and convince myself that having compassion for myself was just as valid as having compassion for a suffering friend. It took time, but eventually, I got there.\n\nFor me, practicing self-compassion created space for me to step back and observe my life without judgment. I began to accept that my struggles were not unique, and that many others go through difficult times as well. It allowed me to speak to myself with kindness and reassurance, just as I would to a friend going through a hard time. Being kind to oneself is not easy, and it takes practice, but like any skill, the more you practice, the better you become.\n\nSelf-compassion can also help others who have their own harsh inner voices. It can be the relentless critic that drives them to be tough on themselves, leading to self-blame, feelings of failure, and a belief that they are not good enough. It can also help those who battle depression, anxiety, or who care for someone who is sick. Some people find themselves trapped in difficult circumstances or working under terrible bosses. It can feel like being shrink-wrapped, unable to break free. While I'm not an expert or therapist, I can confidently say that self-compassion works. It is worth giving it a try.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about self-compassion, I highly recommend the books written by Dr. Kirsten Jeff, a pioneer and leader in the field of self-compassion research for over 15 years. Her website is also a valuable resource.\n\nI now realize why it took me so long to grasp the power of self-compassion. Nonetheless, it's never too late to make a positive change. I hope that self-compassion can bring soothing and harmony into your life as well. END"}

By analyzing users' star-based movie ratings, Netflix was able to understand their preferences and recommend similar movies to other users. Collaborative filtering quickly gained popularity and became the go-to technique for developing recommendation models.\n\nSpotify, on the other hand, utilizes implicit feedback for its recommendation system. Instead of star-based ratings, Spotify's data consists of track stream counts and additional streaming data, such as user-created playlists or visits to artists' pages. Despite this difference, collaborative filtering can still be applied effectively.\n\nSo, how does collaborative filtering work? Let's break it down. Each user has their own set of track preferences. For example, one user may favor tracks P, Q, R, and S, while another user prefers tracks Q, R, S, and T. Collaborative filtering analyzes this data and identifies similarities between users. In this case, both users share an interest in tracks Q, R, and S. Based on this similarity, the system recommends tracks that the other person has listened to, but the user has not yet discovered. For instance, it suggests that the user on the right explore track P, which was enjoyed by their \"similar\" counterpart, while the user on the left should check out track T for the same reasoning.\n\nBut how does Spotify implement this concept on a large scale, calculating millions of users' suggested tracks based on millions of other users' preferences? The answer lies in matrix math, facilitated by Python libraries. The matrix used by Spotify is enormous, with each row representing one of its 140 million users (including yourself if you use Spotify), and each column representing one of the 30 million songs in its database. By utilizing a complex matrix factorization formula and conducting extensive calculations, Spotify generates two types of vectors: user vectors (represented by x) and song vectors (represented by y). These vectors capture a user's taste and a song's profile, respectively.\n\nWith 140 million user vectors and 30 million song vectors in place, the actual values within these vectors may appear meaningless on their own. However, they possess significant utility when compared against one another. Collaborative filtering compares a user's vector with all the other users' vectors to identify the closest matches in terms of musical preferences. Similarly, it allows comparing a song's vector with others to identify similar songs. By leveraging collaborative filtering in conjunction with matrix math, Spotify creates a powerful recommendation engine.\n\nWhile collaborative filtering alone proves effective, Spotify sought to enhance its recommendation system further by incorporating another engine - Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The research reveals that wealth disparity in human societies was insignificant until the advent of agriculture around 13,000 years ago. This finding serves as a cautionary tale for our current age of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe transition to agriculture occurred as nomadic groups settled in one location due to factors like illness, injury, adverse weather conditions, or fear of other tribes. During this period, a select few individuals began experimenting with seed cultivation, discovering that they could grow crops in dedicated plots each year. This discovery reduced their reliance on constant hunting, fishing, and foraging for wild food. As some individuals acquired more land than others, wealth disparities increased. The gaps widened further when people learned to tame large animals like oxen and horses, employing them for tilling larger areas and in combat situations. The possession of advanced technology has always correlated with wealth and power throughout history.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, for example, brought great wealth to those who owned steam engines and factories, replacing human and animal labor with mechanical power. In today's context, computer systems act as the contemporary equivalents of oxen, horses, and steam engines. Those who control this new technological landscape are among the wealthiest individuals. However, technology itself may soon disrupt this long-standing correlation. Numerous esteemed experts predict that computers will surpass human processing power in the next few decades. Concerning, some of these experts, including Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and the late Stephen Hawking, postulate that artificial intelligence machines may eventually attain consciousness, surpass human intelligence, and continue to exponentially increase their intelligence.\n\nThese ultra-intelligent machines pose an existential threat to humanity since humans will be unable to comprehend their thoughts or control them. While the precise timing and occurrence of this hypothetical singularity remain uncertain, these expert warnings merit serious consideration. Scientists have proposed several possible scenarios if and when machines become conscious. The most optimistic scenario suggests machines would work for the benefit of their human creators, free from any desire to harm humanity. However, the lack of understanding regarding machine decision-making makes it challenging to guarantee this outcome. Presently, computer scientists do not fully comprehend the reasoning behind complex computer decisions.\n\nInstances of autonomous machines causing harm to humans already exist, such as drones programmed to locate and attack targets without human intervention. Some scientists argue that if machines achieve consciousness, they would likely view humans as unnecessary and inefficient, potentially leading to their elimination. Elon Musk and others propose that the only way to match these super-intelligent machines is to augment human intelligence by merging human brains with machines, effectively transforming the human race into cyborgs. In this science-fiction-like scenario, the human species would gradually evolve into machines, as the machine elements of cyborgs would undoubtedly progress at a faster pace than their biological components. Consequently, Musk's proposal may not offer a genuine solution, suggesting that machines will inevitably gain control in one way or another.\n\nThe progression of AI stands to further amplify wealth disparities, until the irony ensues that humans lose control of the very technology they invented. While this outcome is unlikely in the near future, it could transpire sooner than anticipated. When it does, for the first time in human history, substantial wealth may hold minimal significance.

It must be a divine power or an unexplainable will that keeps me going\u2014a will I didn't know I possessed.\n\nSimultaneously, this untold story gnaws at me, devouring my innermost being. Every word I meticulously choose, every emotion I portray with adjectives, every action captured through verbs, and every specific detail conveyed through nouns is done with profound care. Yet, sadly, no one will ever have the opportunity to connect with the carefully crafted words I've chosen. There are secrets I must keep, certain truths that cannot be shared.\n\nIn every book, there exists a blank page; a page we may never fill. I lack resolution. I am unable to alleviate your pain. Each new day begins where the last one ended, and I feel as desperate as you do. While you may feel undeserving, I am burdened by a constant sense of inadequacy, as if I am not doing enough.\n\nI am failing myself and my readers. I restrain my characters, bury crucial details, and erect barriers around significant scenes. The hero's journey does not always contain a hero, and I certainly am no hero. I stumble when navigating the uncharted territories of real life. When we commit our thoughts to writing, they become an indelible part of us, forever present. I refer to this as the curse of the creative. We become reliant on processing life through our writing, finding our humanity when we are recognized as humans. We forge connections and form bonds with those who are captivated by our opening paragraphs, cheering for us as we triumphantly reach the end.\n\nIn conclusion, though we writers may be open books to some extent, there are stories we carry that can never be told. We remain bound by the weight of these untold narratives, unable to grant them release. Nonetheless, we strive to connect with others, to touch their hearts, and to find solace in the shared human experience. END"}

One standout feature is its efficient tagging system, which allows users to add multiple sorting tags to each note. Unlike traditional categorization methods found in other apps, Bear's tag system enables users to assign multiple \"categories\" to a single note, enhancing the overall organization. This feature proves particularly valuable when establishing connections between different thoughts and ideas. For example, if a user creates a note outlining a new trading strategy, they can effortlessly categorize it under both \"Code\" and \"Posts\" by simply adding the corresponding tags to the note. Consequently, the note can be easily accessed from both the \"Code\" and \"Posts\" categories in the sidebar. In contrast, other apps would require the user to duplicate the information across various notes, highlighting the superiority of Bear's tag system.\n\nAside from its exceptional organization capabilities, Bear boasts an impressive note editor that excels in capturing ideas on the go. The editor is speedy, sleek, and highly effective, allowing for seamless note-taking even on mobile devices. Markdown support is superb, facilitating swift formatting regardless of the device being used. This stands in stark contrast to other note-taking applications like Agenda, where editing tends to be sluggish and less fluid. Bear significantly reduces friction when capturing multiple ideas simultaneously, making it a powerful and reliable tool for on-the-fly creativity.\n\nUser interface and design are vital considerations for me, and Bear exceeds expectations in this regard. The interface is elegant, visually appealing, and intuitively designed, providing a pleasurable user experience. The aesthetic appeal of Bear's dark and clear themes aligns with my preferences, with the Died theme serving me well on my iPhone and iPad, and Solarized Dark being an excellent fit for the larger screen on my Mac. Bear also offers numerous skin options for those who opt for the pro version, further enhancing the customization possibilities.\n\nFurthermore, Bear sets itself apart by offering seamless integration with other applications, rivaling first-party apps in terms of integration capabilities. The developers have meticulously considered every aspect, allowing for convenient features like setting up Siri shortcuts to dictate new Bear notes or recording post ideas directly from the clipboard. These integrations prove immensely helpful for capturing ideas on the go and ensure a seamless transition between tasks. Additionally, the Bear widgets on my iPad Pro's Today View provide quick access to my most recent notes, allowing me to effortlessly resume where I left off without navigating through categories or employing additional filters. This level of natural accessibility truly makes Bear an extension of my own mind, embodying the essence of what note-taking should be.\n\nBear's appeal extends beyond its in-app functionalities, with the ability to access the local Bear notes database on macOS offering unlimited automation options for manipulating notes. While this may not be necessary for most users, it serves as a testament to the extraordinary flexibility and potential the app provides.\n\nIn terms of pricing, Bear Pro offers exceptional value for money. With a monthly cost of $1.49, or approximately $1.25 per month when billed annually, it is an affordable investment considering the remarkable capabilities and features it provides. The free version, however, does not include sync functionality and offers limited themes, making it more suitable for light users. For individuals like myself who rely on Bear for daily tasks and extended periods of use, investing in Bear Pro is a no-brainer. In fact, the pricing seems almost too good to be true, as it is significantly lower than what one would expect for such a comprehensive and versatile note-taking app. Additionally, the brand loyalty I have developed is further strengthened by the inclusion of free themed wallpapers, solidifying Bear's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend Bear to anyone in need of a powerful note-taking application. It effortlessly caters to both simplicity and complexity, delivering exceptional value for money alongside impressive functionality and aesthetic appeal. Migrating from existing notes apps is a straightforward process, removing any obstacles that may prevent users from embracing this remarkable tool.\n\nOne alternative that has been mentioned is Drafts. While it offers similar editing and organizational features, its overall design and layout fall short in comparison to Bear. The lack of negative space within the editor's layout and cluttered menus can be distracting and undermine the serenity required within an idea sanctuary. Nonetheless, if a user is less particular about these design aspects, Drafts may still be worth considering as an alternative. END"}

Inspired by her beloved novels and the recent sensation of the Netflix series \"Bridgerton,\" this clever parody showcases Austen's talent not only as a novelist but also as a wordsmith.\n\nOn the first day of Christmas, Jane Austen presents us with a proposal to a lady\u2014a quintessentially romantic gesture that sets the tone for the rest of her lyrical adaptation. As we progress through the subsequent days, Austen masterfully incorporates elements of her storytelling, infusing the carol with her trademark characters and sly commentary.\n\nContinuing the narrative, Austen introduces two pompous men on the second day of Christmas, adding depth and levity to the verses. The third day brings three French gowns, evoking the fashionable allure of Austen's era, while the fourth day gifts us with four carriages, a testament to the societal grandeur portrayed in her novels.\n\nBut it is on the fifth day that Austen truly captures our attention, as she presents us with five ruined girls\u2014a reminder of the consequences that befell those who strayed from societal expectations. This poignant inclusion showcases Austen's ability to portray both the joys and pitfalls of regency society.\n\nAs the verses progress, Austen introduces us to a host of characters that have become synonymous with her works. Six ladies-a-walking grace the sixth day, embodying the elegance and grace that characterizes Austen's heroines. Seven schemers-a-scheming lead us into the seventh day, a nod to the cunning manipulations often witnessed in her narratives.\n\nThe eighth day introduces us to eight mothers\u2014an ever-present source of worry and concern within Austen's works. Nine soldiers-a-flirting add a touch of romance to the ninth day, while the tenth day humorously portrays ten characters misunderstanding, highlighting the miscommunications that perpetually fuel Austen's plots.\n\nOn the eleventh day, Austen gifts us with eleven meaningful glances, illustrating the power of unspoken connections in her storytelling. Finally, on the twelfth day, the carol culminates with twelve maids actually working\u2014an acknowledgement of the labor and domesticity portrayed throughout Austen's narratives.\n\nBy incorporating beloved themes and characters from her novels, Jane Austen's adaptation of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" enlightens us with her unique perspective on regency society.

States in the coming fall. If the United States does not take decisive action, it could face a difficult autumn. Previously, COVID-19 cases and deaths were decreasing in many parts of the country, leading to the hope that a return to relative normalcy was possible. However, the premature reopening and disregard for safety measures contributed to a resurgence of the virus.\n\nExperts highlight two factors that could greatly impact the situation in the fall: the reopening of schools and the arrival of the cold and flu season. While school reopening are important for students and parents, they could potentially become hotspots for further virus transmission. Adherence to safety measures, such as wearing masks and self-quarantine, is crucial for a safe reopening, but the politicization of these measures makes it unlikely. Moreover, the convergence of the common cold, flu, and COVID-19 could strain testing capabilities and lead to more severe infections.\n\nIt is essential that the United States significantly improves its testing capabilities to identify and treat COVID-19 cases effectively. Unfortunately, after seven months of the pandemic, testing deficiencies persist due to leadership issues. Strong leadership and effective communication are necessary to address this problem.\n\nHowever, there is still a window of opportunity to improve the situation before the fall. With concerted efforts and leadership at all levels, including national, the United States could prevent a calamitous situation. Compliance with mask usage, controlled reopening of risky establishments like bars, and avoiding large gatherings without adequate social distancing can help lower infection rates. Additionally, the development of effective COVID-19 treatments may provide some relief.\n\nNevertheless, the outlook remains challenging. There are concerns that people's behavior, including non-compliance with safety protocols, could hinder progress. Optimistic models regarding lower transmission rates did not foresee the lack of adherence to preventative measures in large parts of the country.\n\nIn conclusion, decisive action and adherence to safety measures are crucial for the United States to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in the coming fall. Strong leadership, increased testing capabilities, and personal responsibility are essential to navigate through this challenging time successfully. END"}

The analysis of the THANES dataset reveals that there is a small difference between diastolic (t=-2.47) and systolic BP (t=3.1) in the age group of [0-10 years] compared to other age groups. One of the reasons for this observation is the low sexual differentiation during this pre-puberty period.\n\nThe difference between males and females in systolic BP reaches its maximum value in the age group of [20-30 years] (t=37.31), while for diastolic BP it is in the age group of [30-40 years] (t=19.68). In both cases, BP is higher in males compared to females (hence the positive t value, with variable 1 always representing the male group compared to variable 2, which represents the female group). After the greatest difference in systolic BP observed in the [20-30 years] age group, the difference gradually decreases with age, reaching a negative t value of -1.9 in the age group of [60-70 years], indicating that, based on our sample, the mean systolic BP of females is higher than that of males. The difference in diastolic BP between males and females also reduces over time, and several factors may contribute to this observed result, including a drop in sexual hormones in females as they age.\n\nBy examining the \"t age\" values for systolic BP, it is clear that males experience a significant increase in BP, particularly between the age groups of [10-20 years] (t=33.16) and [20-30 years] (t=34.71). This increase slows down in older age groups, for example, [70-80 years] (t=4.17). Females, on the other hand, start with a slower increase in systolic BP in the age groups of [10-20 years] (t=23.85) and [20-30 years] (t=17.47). Then, females show an increase in the t values in the age group of [40-50 years] (t=20.9), reaching the point of having a higher mean systolic BP in the age group of [60-70 years] (based on the sample analyzed).\n\nTurning to the \"t age\" values for diastolic BP, it is worth noting the shape of a \"U\" pattern observed in the data over the years for both sexes, increasing until the age group of [40-50 years] and decreasing thereafter. The purpose of calculating \"t male\" and \"t female\" was to observe variations between diastolic and systolic BP in males and females, respectively, across different age groups. In the first age group of [0-10 years], we observe a \"t female\" of 104.14 and a \"t male\" of 103.36, which increase in the age group of [10-20 years] and decline as age increases. This was an unexpected result since the difference between means increases after 40 years old. However, we also notice a continuous increase in the standard deviation of the variables as the groups get older, particularly in systolic BP.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this data analysis might contain many biases. Factors such as smoking, HDL cholesterol, obesity, nutrition behavior, alcohol consumption, and diabetes were not explored between age groups and genders and may influence BP.\n\nIn summary, the difference in BP between males and females is minimal in the age group of 0-10 years. The difference becomes more evident between 10-40 years, with males having higher systolic and diastolic BP. These differences decrease between 40-70 years and reverse between 70-80 years in terms of systolic BP, while the differences in diastolic BP reduce after 40-50 years. Both genders experience an increase in systolic BP as they get older, and both also experience an increase in diastolic BP until the age of 40-50, after which diastolic BP decreases. END"}

It is crucial to have a clear understanding of the things that could seriously compromise your well-being, as per the latest statistics from the National Safety Council. While some may find exhilaration in facing lightning storms head-on or swimming in the ocean, it is important to consider the real risks that exist.\n\nAccording to the National Safety Council's most recent analysis for the year 2017, here are the leading causes of death that could potentially hinder your well-being:\n\n1. Heart disease: 1 in 6 individuals face the risk of dying due to heart disease.\n2. Cancer: 1 in 7 individuals face the risk of being affected by cancer.\n3. Chronic lower respiratory disease: 1 in 27 individuals face the risk of chronic lower respiratory disease.\n4. Suicide: 1 in 88 individuals face the risk of succumbing to suicide.\n5. Opioid overdose: 1 in 96 individuals face the risk of experiencing an opioid overdose.\n6. Motor vehicle crash: 1 in 103 individuals face the risk of being involved in a motor vehicle crash.\n7. Fall: 1 in 114 individuals face the risk of sustaining injuries from a fall.\n8. Gun assault: 1 in 285 individuals face the risk of being assaulted by a gun.\n9. Pedestrian incident: 1 in 556 individuals face the risk of being involved in a pedestrian incident.\n\nWhile these statistics provide valuable insights, it is essential to note that they cover only selected categories of causes of death. Nonetheless, here are a few more causes that are worth considering:\n\n10. Motorcyclist: 1 in 858 motorcyclists face the risk, but it is important to remember that these odds refer to accidents involving motorcyclists.\n11. Drowning: 1 in 1,117 individuals face the risk of drowning, which is only slightly behind the fear of shark attacks.\n12. Fire or smoke: 1 in 1,474 individuals face the risk of fire or smoke-related incidents.\n13. Choking on food: 1 in 2,696 individuals face the risk of choking on food.\n14. Bicyclist: 1 in 4,047 bicyclists face the risk of accidents while riding.\n15. Accidental gun discharge: 1 in 8,527 individuals face the risk of accidental gun discharge.\n16. Sunstroke: 1 in 8,912 individuals face the risk of sunstroke.\n17. Electrocution, radiation, extreme temperatures, and pressure: 1 in 15,638 individuals face the risk of injuries from these sources.\n18. Sharp objects: 1 in 28,000 individuals face the risk of injuries caused by sharp objects.\n19. Cataclysmic storm: 1 in 31,394 individuals face the risk of being affected by a catastrophic storm.\n20. Hot surfaces and substances: 1 in 46,045 individuals face the risk of sustaining injuries due to hot surfaces or substances.\n21. Hornet, wasp, and bee stings: 1 in 46,562 individuals face the risk of allergic reactions to stings.\n22. Dog attack: 1 in 115,111 individuals face the risk of being attacked by a dog.\n23. Plane crash: 1 in 188,364 individuals face the risk of being involved in a plane crash.\n24. Lightning: 1 in 218,106 individuals face the unlikely risk of being struck by lightning.\n25. Railway passenger: 1 in 243,765 individuals face the risk of accidents while being a railway passenger.\n\nOf course, it is important to understand that the more cautious we are in avoiding certain activities, such as riding motorcycles, bicycles, or trains, the more we can reduce the chances of encountering these risks. Additionally, it is crucial to educate ourselves about healthy living practices such as maintaining a nutritious diet, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, getting ample sleep, managing stress levels, and engaging in regular exercise, as these lifestyle choices can reduce the risks associated with various causes of death.\n\nWhile fear is a natural and healthy response that can facilitate our ability to respond to danger or avoid hazardous situations, it is crucial to avoid overestimating risks in certain areas and underestimating real risks that can pose harm. Anxiety and disrupted daily routines can occur when we obsessively worry about the wrong things. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between acknowledging the potential dangers and living our lives to the fullest.\n\nWhen it comes to the odds of dying by asteroid or in a shark attack, though these were not included in the National Safety Council's list, it is worth mentioning that the chances are exceedingly low. Estimates place the odds of dying in a shark attack at 1 in 3.7 million and the odds of dying by an asteroid at 1 in 700,000 to 1 in 1.6 million. While these numbers provide some perspective, it is important to remember that living in fear is not conducive to a fulfilling life.\n\nTo conclude, understanding the leading causes of death and taking reasonable precautions can help us better navigate the risks that exist in our lives. Balance and informed decision-making are key in living a life that is both meaningful and safe. END"}

In the past two years, digital and social media have undergone significant shifts that many marketers have failed to fully acknowledge. While you may have come across headlines and reports on the rise of digital spending, it is essential to pay closer attention to these trends. Social media should no longer be treated as a neglected marketing tool that is only given attention sporadically. It is time to recognize its potential and embrace it as a vital component of your marketing strategy.\n\nEntrepreneur and tech expert Gary Vaynerchuk aptly described social media as a slang term for the current state of the internet. In its early days, social media consisted of a few networks primarily used by younger audiences. However, in 2017, platforms like Facebook (including Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp), Snapchat, Pinterest, and YouTube attract billions of users who spend a significant amount of their time on these platforms. Moreover, these platforms are evolving beyond being simply social channels and are becoming full-fledged media companies.\n\nIf you find it challenging to understand the importance of social media in today's digital landscape, consider this: in March 2017, Snapchat went public and within its first week, its valuation exceeded that of renowned companies like Delta, Target, Hershey, Viacom, CBS, and Hilton. Additionally, data from sources like Comscore, marketer, and Nielsen indicates that a significant portion of digital time is spent on mobile devices, with almost half of that time being dedicated to social media and messaging apps. These statistics highlight the importance of adapting to consumer behavior patterns that prioritize mobile and social interactions.\n\nIt is crucial for marketers to stop underestimating the power of social media platforms. In the past, many marketers dismissed platforms like Facebook, only to regret it later when they realized the missed opportunities. Similarly, Snapchat, with over 150 million daily users spending considerable time on the platform, cannot be disregarded simply because it may not fit the same feed format as other familiar social networks. Mega brands in various industries, such as hotels and transportation, have been taken by surprise by disruptors like Airbnb and Uber, resulting in significant revenue losses. It is clear that digital, social media, peer-to-peer messaging apps, and the gig economy continue to assert their dominance, threatening even the most established giants.\n\nMarketers must also acknowledge that the traditional advertising and marketing methods of the past are no longer relevant in today's society and consumer behaviors. Social media has already become the next big thing, yet many marketers have failed to capitalize on its potential and give it the respect it deserves. Currently, the entry cost for leveraging social media is relatively low because mega brands have yet to fully price out the competition. However, this will not last, and once major brands fully embrace social advertising, the cost to enter the market will increase significantly. Small and medium-sized businesses will feel the strain of rising costs, and the cost per thousand impressions (CPM) to reach target audiences will likely increase by three to five times what it is today by 2020. Therefore, businesses need to seize the current opportunity before it escalates further.\n\nMoreover, social media is continually evolving, and marketers must adapt accordingly. The rise of messaging apps is a prime example. Many marketers assume that younger audiences are not using Facebook, but in reality, they are merely utilizing different aspects of the platform through peer-to-peer messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Marketers need to recognize this mass usage of messaging apps and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversation around social media for marketers should no longer be a matter of whether to use it. If you find yourself still debating the ROI of shifting dollars from your pay-per-click (PPC) spend to social media or wondering how to effectively use social media, you are missing the mark entirely. It is time to reconfigure your understanding of digital marketing and shift your focus from immediate ROI to long-term brand value and customer retention. Social media is not just a passing trend but a crucial component of a successful marketing strategy. END"}
{"prompt": "when you hear stories about the most gigantic projects having a microservice architecture , you are tempted to introduce dozens of tiny applications that would work for you , like house elves , invisible and undemanding . however , system architectures lie on a spectrum . what we imagine is the extreme end of that spectrum tiny applications exchanging many messages . at the other end of the spectrum you imagine a giant monolith that stands alone to do too many things . in reality , there are many service-oriented architectures lying somewhere between those two extremes . in a nutshell , a microservice architecture means that each application , or microservice\u2019s code and resources are its very own and will not be shared with any other app . when two applications need to communicate , they use an application programming interface ( api ) \u2014 a controlled set of rules that both programs can handle . developers can make many changes to each application as long as it plays well with the api . this idea comes in many flavors , with different shares of the monolith architecture . in this post , we are going to discuss one of such variations of microservice architecture , known as hexagonal architecture . the first key concept of this architecture is to keep all the business models and logic in a single place , and the second concept \u2014 each hexagon should be independent . what is hexagonal architecture ? invented by alistair cockburn in 2005 , hexagonal architecture , or to call it properly , ports and adapters , is driven by the idea that the application is central to your system . all inputs and outputs reach or leave the core of the application through a port that isolates the application from external technologies , tools and delivery mechanics . allow an application to equally be driven by users , programs , automated test or batch scripts , and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases . alistair cockburn hexagonal architecture draws a thick line between the software\u2019s inside and outside parts , decoupling the business logic from the persistence and the service layer . the inside part makes up the use cases and the domain model it\u2019s built upon . the outside part includes ui , database , etc . the connection between them is realized via ports and their implementation counterparts are called adapters . in this way , hexagonal architecture ensures encapsulation of logic in different layers , which ensures higher testability and control over the code . architecture components each side of the hexagon represents an input \u2014 port that uses an adapter for the specific type . hence , ports and adapters form two major components of hexagon architecture ports a port is a gateway , provided by the core logic . it allows the entry or exiting of data to and from the application . the simplest implementation of a port is an api layer . ports exist in 2 types inbound and outbound . an inbound port is the only part of the core exposed to the world that defines how the core business logic can be used . an outbound port is an interface the core needs to communicate with the outside world adapters an adapter transforms one interface into another , creating a bridge between the application and the service that it needs . in hexagonal architecture all communication between the primary ( which use system to achieve a particular goal ) and secondary actors ( which system uses to achieve primary actor\u2019s goals ) and application ports is done with the help of adapters . therefore , adapters can also be of two types primary adapters the primary or driving adapters represents the ui . it is a piece of code between the user and the core logic . they are called driving adapters because they drive the application , and start actions in the core application . examples of a primary adapters are api controllers , web controllers or views . secondary adapters the secondary or driven adapters represent the connection to back-end databases , external libraries , mail api\u2019s , etc . it is an implementation of the secondary port , which is an interface . these adapters react to actions initiated by the primary adapters . domain model the third component of the architecture is the domain model , a conceptual model that represents meaningful concepts to the domain that need to be modelled in software . the concepts include the data involved in the business and rules the business uses in relation to that data . benefits of hexagonal architecture high maintainability , since changes in one area of an application doesn\u2019t affect others . ports and adapters are replaceable with different implementations that conform to the same interface . the application is agnostic to the outside world , so it can be driven by any number of different controls . the application is independent from external services , so you can develop the inner core before building external services , such as databases . easier to test in isolation , since the code is decoupled from the implementation details of the outside world . our implementation of hexagonal architecture one of sciforce\u2019s projects required to separate often changing external elements from internal ones that might lessen the impact of change and simplify the testing process . the standard architectural template is based on the spring set of frameworks the core contains objects that represent the business logic of the service . typically for hexagonal architecture , the core knows nothing about the outside world , including the network and the file system . all communication with the outside world is handled by inbound and outbound gateway layers . in our application , a port is a groovy interface used to access either a core or an outbound object and an adapter is an implementation of a port interface that understands how to transform to and from external representations into the core\u2019s internal data model . you can swap out an adapter in gateway layer for example , you can enable accepting messages from rabbitmq instead of http clients with no impact on the core . we can also substitute service stubs for outbound gateways increasing the speed and reliability of integration tests . example simple application in the example , we show a scheme of a simple application that uses the spring framework to accept a rest request with some text , converts the text to lowercase and saves it to mongodb . at the first step , when the client sends an http request , the restcontroller is responsible for handling it . in terms of hexagonal architecture , this controller serves as an adapter that communicates the request from the http protocol to the internal domain model ( a simple string in this case ) . it is also responsible for calling into the core via the port and sending the results back over the

considering projects that utilize a microservice architecture, it is natural to be drawn to the idea of implementing numerous small applications that function independently, much like house elves - invisible and undemanding. However, it is important to understand that system architectures exist on a spectrum. On one extreme, there are tiny applications that exchange frequent messages, while on the other end, a large monolithic application handles multiple functionalities. In reality, most service-oriented architectures lie somewhere between these two extremes.\n\nIn this post, we will discuss one variation of microservice architecture known as hexagonal architecture. Hexagonal architecture, also referred to as ports and adapters, was introduced by Alistair Cockburn in 2005. It revolves around the concept of keeping the application at the core of the system. All inputs and outputs pass through a port, which acts as a gateway and isolates the application from external technologies, tools, and delivery mechanisms. This allows the application to be driven by users, programs, automated tests, or batch scripts, while being developed and tested independently of its eventual runtime environment and databases.\n\nHexagonal architecture emphasizes the decoupling of business logic from persistence and service layers. The core of the architecture consists of use cases and a domain model, while the outer part includes the user interface, database, and other external components. The connection between these parts is established through ports and their corresponding adapters. This approach ensures encapsulation of logic in different layers, leading to improved testability and code control.\n\nThe hexagonal architecture comprises three main components. The input side of the hexagon represents ports, which are gateways allowing data to enter or exit the application. Ports can be categorized as inbound and outbound. Inbound ports define how the core business logic can be used and are the only part of the core exposed to the outside world. On the other hand, outbound ports facilitate communication between the core and external entities.\n\nAdapters, the second component, act as bridges between the application and the services it requires. Adapters transform one interface into another. In hexagonal architecture, all communication between primary actors (those who use the system to achieve a specific goal) and secondary actors (those whom the system employs to achieve the primary actors' goals) is facilitated through adapters. Primary adapters, also known as driving adapters, represent user interfaces and initiate actions in the core application. Secondary adapters, or driven adapters, connect to back-end databases, external libraries, and other services, reacting to actions initiated by primary adapters.\n\nThe third component of hexagonal architecture is the domain model. This conceptual model represents meaningful concepts related to the business and the data and rules associated with them.\n\nHexagonal architecture provides several benefits, including high maintainability. Changes in one part of an application do not affect others, and ports and adapters can be replaced with different implementations conforming to the same interface. The application remains agnostic to the external world, enabling it to be driven by various control mechanisms. Moreover, the application remains independent of external services, allowing the development of the core before building external services like databases. The architecture also facilitates isolated testing since the code is decoupled from the implementation details of the external components.\n\nAt Sci force, we have implemented hexagonal architecture in one of our projects to separate frequently changing external elements from internal components, reducing the impact of change and simplifying the testing process. Our standard architectural template is based on the Spring framework. The core logic represents the business logic of the service and remains unaware of the outside world. Inbound and outbound gateway layers handle all communication with the external components. Ports define the interfaces used to access the core or outbound objects, while adapters implement these interfaces and handle the transformation between external representations and the core's internal data model. Adapters can be easily swapped out, ensuring flexibility and reliability in integration tests.\n\nIn a simple application example, a Spring-based rest controller receives an HTTP request, which serves as an adapter communicating with the internal domain model. The rest controller invokes the conversion service via the conversion port interface. The conversion service, as an inbound adapter, performs the required processing and delegates the storage of results to the outbound persistence port. The mongodbgateway, an implementation of the persistence port, handles the adaptation of the core's internal model to interact with MongoDB. This example showcases the basic structure, but in real-world applications, multiple objects would interact, with rest controllers invoking different services, which, in turn, call various outbound gateways.\n\nTo summarize, hexagonal architecture decouples application logic from inputs and outputs, freeing the core code from unnecessary technical details and promoting flexibility, testability, and efficiency. However, like any architecture, hexagonal architecture has its limitations and downsides. For example, it may increase the number of classes at the boundary. It proves most beneficial when dealing with classes that may be replaced in production or need to be faked during testing due to external dependencies.\n\nIn conclusion, hexagonal architecture offers a valuable approach for structuring applications by separating concerns and achieving a higher level of flexibility and testability.

Moon is reminiscent of the creative and unexpected projects that often come out of the MSCHF Factory. Known for their intentionally absurd and viral stunts, MSCHF has created unique items such as Nike sneakers filled with holy water, toaster-shaped bath bombs, and an app for stock investments based on astrological signs. While Heron Preston's collaboration with Moon may seem like another outrageous venture, it actually dropped on Stock on October 27th, with prices ranging from $15 to $27 through Drop. This limited edition stain removal whitening toothpaste is part of a limited batch of 350 items. \n\nCollaborations like Moon x Heron Preston, Colgate x Supreme, Time Leon More x Porsche 964, McDonald's x Travis Scott, or White Castle x Tel far are often dismissed as gimmicky, tongue-in-cheek, garish, and lowbrow. However, many of these collaborations are meant to be appreciated ironically and knowingly. Good collaborations can be seen as art, while great collaborations border on kitsch. They fit perfectly into the definition of kitsch as purposefully fake replicas that create a humorous effect. Taking them too seriously would miss the joke entirely.\n\nIn many ways, collaborations mirror the world of art and kitsch. There are auctions, collectors, dealers, critics, resale marketplaces, and monographs. Just like art, collaborations aim to shock and surprise, elude criticism, and strive for high prices and cultural immortality. As Andy Warhol famously said, \"You know it's art when the check clears.\" Warhol, along with artists like Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Indiana, turned everyday objects into works of art by infusing them with pop references and associations. Not only did Warhol create art, but he also made commercials that were considered art, such as the Absolut Vodka ad he launched in 1986. Likewise, fine art has ventured into fashion, design, and pop culture. Elsa Schiaparelli, the original creator of the newspaper print dress, collaborated with surrealist artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed on her designs. In the '80s, New York designer Will Smith invited artists, performers, and graphic designers to participate in his project of integrating art into daily life. In more recent years, fashion-art collaborations have become lucrative ventures, with brands like Louis Vuitton partnering with artists such as Jeff Moons, Damien First, Takashi Murasaki, and Stephen Spouse, turning collaborations into global successes.\n\nToday, collaborations continue to flourish. Artists like Cindy Sherman collaborate with fashion brands like Undercover, and Mayor Kusama releases limited-edition bottles for Verve Liquor. When someone purchases a Cindy Sherman x Undercover item, they aren't merely buying a bag or a t-shirt \u2013 they are acquiring a legitimate work of art. By wearing it, they demonstrate their knowledge and cultural awareness. They see themselves through a new lens, not merely as consumers but as collectors. Successful collaborations generate collectibles, justify high prices, create cult objects, and thrust brands into the realm of intangibles. In this way, Undercover, for example, becomes more than just a commercial entity\u2014it becomes a shrine of culture and human creativity. Collaborations allow brands to embed themselves in culture rather than just a market segment. They transform non-culture into culture, making them an excellent business model that requires strong brand capital rather than financial capital. Supreme, for instance, can put its logo on a brick and collaborate with Colgate as long as its brand equity remains attractive. Brands like Monster, Mini, and Time Leon More have made collaborations an integral part of their DNA, recognizing that compressed trend cycles and bored consumers demand constantly new and fascinating products. Collaborations help to meet these demands by riffing off popular and familiar items. Brands like Uniqlo can sell many items when made in collaboration with designers like Jun Takashi, Oil Sander, or Pharrell, as the fashion link allows Uniqlo to convey elitism to all consumers.\n\nCollaborations also enable brands to cultivate a sense of exclusivity and maintain cultural pioneers' interest in the brand. Limited editions attract collectors, while collaborations render competitors irrelevant. However, the most challenging collaborations to replicate are those that are inconsistent and random, like Heron Preston x Moon or Steven Alan x Murine. Their genius lies in their ability to reject coherence, knowing that coherence is for those who lack creativity. Collaborations are not merely brand extensions; they are a creative expression that allows brands to flex their zeitgeist muscles, establish themselves as trendsetters, and use their products as a form of brand communication. When Chanel creates a snowboard or Ikea collaborates with designer Craig Green, they bring a modern and culturally relevant feel to their respective brands, attracting collectors, cultural pioneers, and hype beasts. These collaborations become the source of a brand's aspirational power, which is essential in the modern economy. Economic growth no longer solely depends on price; it is driven by taste, aesthetics, identity, and thrill. Products serve as vehicles for beauty, thrill, identity, and transformative experiences, transcending their basic functionality.\n\nIn this context, Moon Toothpaste's collaboration with Heron Preston takes their mission of elevating the everyday oral care routine to a whole new level. Collaborating with Heron Preston amplifies the cultural and social relevance of brushing teeth. Having an orange toothpaste turns a mundane hygiene task into a creative and inspiring ritual. Each time we brush our teeth with Heron Preston x Moon toothpaste, we create a social distinction between ourselves and those still using Crest. We also create a connection to other cultural pioneers in the realm of oral care. Collaborations go beyond being a mere brand gloss; they transform a brand's operating system strategically. In the aspirational economy, this transformation is crucial for a brand's long-term renewal and cultural relevance. Collaborations across a brand's value chain offer a safe bet on its cultural and business future. In marketing and sales, collaborations protect pricing power, ensure high margins, and reshape consumers' perception of the brand. In product concept and production, collaborators provide value innovation. In distribution, collaborations expand a brand's market and renew its customer base. Collaborations are also impactful in merchandising, adding halo to the core collection, reevaluating brand perception, and increasing brand consideration. Nike, for example, often previews new models on the runways of fashion collaborators like Undercover or Sakai before their commercial release.\n\nCollaborations constantly recontextualize brands, taking them from one context and placing them in another. In that sense, there is no such thing as a \"bad\" collaboration. Collaborations serve as calculated cultural and business tests, some more fertile than others. Just like evolution mixes things up to determine what sticks, a brand remains alive and relevant through remixes. Collaborations are the strategy for brand awareness, market expansion, and maintaining a brand's youthful spirit. By recontextualizing, a brand can trade in exchange value rather than merely use value. Use value is defined by a product's functionality, while exchange value is defined by its social appeal. When a product gains social recognition, it becomes a market hit. Brands that engage in the cultural exchange system rather than focusing only on a specific market segment come out as winners. Collaborations give everyday products an identity and differentiate a brand in a crowded competitive landscape. A brand becomes the key product differentiator, elevating products beyond their basic function and setting them apart from commodities. Collaborations reinforce brand identity, ensure its continuity, and connect products into a larger narrative. In a world where consumption is more than just fulfilling basic needs, collaborations infuse taste and meaning into ordinary consumption. Today, a brand's products and services serve not only functional purposes but also seek to aesthetically enrich the lives of buyers, becoming social symbols that communicate status, distinction, and a sense of belonging.\n\nCollaborations become easier to understand once we move beyond perceiving them as mere brand stunts and instead view them as art. Art is a significant business and serves as a commentator, critic, and cynic of society and culture. It reveals the realities of the world we live in and provides insights into the future. Collaborations achieve a similar purpose. They are calculated cultural and business endeavors, testing various contexts to ascertain what resonates with consumers. Some collaborations prove more successful than others, but the essence of collaborations lies in their transformative power. They allow brands to trade on their exchange value and become agents in the cultural exchange system. This transformative process is the key to a brand's long-term renewal and cultural relevance.\n\nOverall, collaborations are a strategic tool that impacts a brand's marketing and sales, product concept and production, distribution, and merchandising. They shape consumers' perception, protect pricing power, and create value innovation. Collaborations establish connections to new markets and customer bases, renew brand associations, and add halo to core collections. They are about more than just profit margins; they infuse beauty, thrill, identity, and transformative experiences into the lives of consumers. Brands that engage in collaborations trade in exchange value and tap into intangible social and cultural capital\u2014this is what fuels their growth in the modern economy. By collaborating with Heron Preston, Moon Toothpaste showcases its commitment to elevating the everyday oral care routine into a true oral beauty experience. This project makes brushing teeth culturally and socially relevant, transforming a mundane task into a creative and inspiring ritual. Collaborations are not just a shiny gloss; they are a strategic transformation of a brand's operating system that ensures long-term cultural and business success. END"}

This unique collaboration has allowed us to deliver substantial value to our clients through data-driven products and services that address user needs and solve critical business problems. Despite the immense potential of this partnership, many organizations struggle to facilitate effective collaboration between data scientists and designers. In this article, we will share best practices and lessons learned on how data scientists and designers can work together to deliver transformative products and services.\n\nTo maximize the benefits of this powerful collaboration, it is crucial to create a shared understanding between data scientists and designers, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives. Instead of working on parallel tracks in isolation, we should seize opportunities for knowledge sharing and encourage open questioning. By remaining flexible and receptive to different approaches, data scientists can gain a deep understanding of user needs, while designers can tap into the possibilities presented by large datasets. For example, when working with one of our aerospace clients, our data science team was conducting exploratory data analysis, while our design team was conducting user interviews. By co-locating the team and fostering spontaneous check-ins, the design team was able to validate research findings using real data, and the data science team gained valuable insights into the intricacies contained within the data. This approach resulted in a much deeper understanding of both the end users and the data.\n\nIt is crucial not to lose sight of the business goals when embarking on the data science and design collaboration journey. Data science is a process for solving business problems using data, and therefore, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the business before diving into the process. Sometimes, the design process can become overly focused on user-centric perspectives, overlooking real-world realities and constraints. Conversely, data scientists can become too immersed in solving technical problems, losing sight of the core issues that need to be addressed. To ensure the success of any collaboration between data science and design, it is critical to align user needs with business goals. Equipping the team with a solid understanding of the business will result in solutions that not only meet user needs but also deliver value to the organization. For instance, while working with a Fortune 100 manufacturing company, we realized that the initial problem at hand was too broad. By adopting a \"business goals\" lens and considering user needs and stakeholder input, we were able to narrow our focus to high-value problems and develop solutions that truly benefitted the organization.\n\nDefining the right problem is just the beginning; successful execution relies on seamless collaboration among team members. It is crucial to integrate various viewpoints, skills, and expertise at every stage to solve the right business problem collectively. At Fjord, we have developed a framework that leverages a human-centered design approach to translate business problems into solvable data science problems.

Multi-class classification refers to the task of predicting one class from multiple classes. An example is given where the task of selecting a mango from a basket of various fruits represents a multi-class classification problem.\n\nThe article explains that certain classification algorithms, such as logistic regression and support vector classifier, are not directly designed for multi-class classification. However, by applying a heuristic approach to these algorithms, it is possible to solve multi-class classification problems.\n\nThe first approach discussed is the one-vs-rest approach. In this approach, the multi-class data is split into multiple binary classes. For example, if there are three classes (machine learning, deep learning, NLP), one class is assigned to class 0, and the remaining classes are assigned to class 1. This process is repeated for each class to create individual models. The model with the highest probability becomes the final prediction for that specific class.\n\nThe article provides an example of logistic regression for multi-class classification using the one-vs-rest strategy. It demonstrates the implementation using Python's Scikit-learn library.\n\nHowever, the article acknowledges that the one-vs-rest approach has a disadvantage. It creates a number of models equal to the number of classes, resulting in slow prediction of output and higher time complexity.\n\nThe second approach discussed is the one-vs-one approach. In this approach, each class is compared with every other class. For example, if there are four classes (A, B, C, D), six binary classes are created (A vs B, A vs C, A vs D, B vs C, B vs D, C vs D). The model with the highest probability determines the final predicted output.\n\nThe article includes an example of using support vector machines with the one-vs-one strategy for multi-class classification. It showcases the implementation using Python's Scikit-learn library.\n\nIn conclusion, the article provides an overview of multi-class classification and the use of one-vs-rest and one-vs-one approaches to address such problems. It invites readers to provide suggestions for further improvement and offers a link for additional learning on the topic. END"}

However, one undeniable truth remains: how we react to life's challenges plays a significant role in our experiences. Taking a proactive approach is often considered the best course of action, but sometimes we find ourselves in a position where we must react to unexpected circumstances. In such moments, how we respond holds tremendous importance and reveals our true character.\n\nPunctuality serves as a fundamental pillar in both social and professional life. Unfortunately, it often clashes with the curveballs that life throws our way. Natural or human causes can present obstacles that disrupt our punctuality. In these instances, how we handle the situation and effectively communicate become crucial considerations. It is essential to reflect on the significance of punctuality and how it reflects upon us as individuals.\n\nTrust and dependability form the foundation of many aspects of our lives. We place an underappreciated amount of trust in strangers, and this trust is often preloaded when meeting new people. In the workplace, the hiring process serves as a vetting mechanism, establishing a baseline level of trust for new colleagues, managers, and direct reports. It is comforting to believe that we can confidently entrust responsibilities to others. However, consistently displaying late arrivals, whether to an interview, meetings, or meeting deadlines, negatively impacts trust. While this might be preferable to lacking interpersonal skills, it still engenders a sense of distrust. Being punctual strengthens existing trust or confirms it in the eyes of others. We all know individuals who are consistently dependable, both personally and professionally. When they assure us of their presence at a meeting or offer their assistance, there is no doubt that they will follow through. Strive to be such a person by making punctuality a habitual pattern.\n\nRespect is a fundamental aspect of punctuality. When someone is late for a meeting or lunch, the initial feeling is often surprised, assuming that unforeseen circumstances caused the delay. However, if a person consistently displays tardiness, it can lead to the perception that they do not value others' time or the commitments made. While this may not always be true, it is challenging to avoid this internal accusation. It is human nature to presume that a person's actions reflect their core character rather than external circumstances. It boils down to repetition. Being punctual demonstrates self-respect, respect for others, and respect for the task at hand. People appreciate the belief that you hold that respect, and they reciprocate accordingly. It is essential to convey that investing time in you is worthwhile.\n\nIntegrity is paramount in all aspects of life. The famous phrase \"your word is your bond\" rings true across various domains. When you give your word, it immediately reflects upon your character as an individual, coworker, and friend. While other forms of judgment can be reversed, damage to one's integrity is not easily rectified. Misplacing value in your word can have irreversible consequences, depending on the circumstances. Your personal brand derives its worth from the steadfastness of your word. Uphold your word unwaveringly to preserve your integrity. END"}

{"prompt": "as with many others , greta thunberg is my current number one hero . she makes me think . and , importantly , she walks her talk . compared to most americans i have a teeny tiny carbon footprint but greta has got me thinking about how i might make it even smaller . i\u2019ve realized there is more i can do but i\u2019ve also realized that i am not sure i can go \u2018full greta\u2019 and i\u2019ll explain why in a minute . greta does not use fossil fuel powered vehicles for transportation . for many americans that would be unthinkable . at my last job i had a co-worker who lived just two blocks from the office yet she drove to work each day . when her car broke down she was beside herself . she didn\u2019t know what to do . she was calling all her friends trying to get rides to work . it never occurred to her to simply go out her front door and walk two blocks . it never occurred to her ! sadly , this is the mindset of so many americans . they simply will not go anywhere without driving . i have not owned a fossil fuel powered car \u2014 or any vehicle \u2014 in six years . i\u2019ve gone for long stretches of time without a car several times in the past as well . i walk ! and my legs do not pollute . and they don\u2019t require license plates , a license , insurance , gas , or constant repair bills . they have not only saved the planet from some pollution but they have saved me countless tens of thousands of dollars . and walking has also greatly improved my health . of course i must admit that going car-less has not always been about environmental activism . usually it was brought about by debilitating poverty . it was not until i was forced to go car-less that i began understanding the environmental impact of doing so . now i\u2019m quite happy and healthy being car-less . as poverty continues to skyrocket in america many others will be forced to give up their expensive car addictions . this will probably help the environment a little but i don\u2019t think this is the best way to address the climate crisis . the results are not as powerful when we are forced into action as they are when we consciously and purposefully take action through choice . greta also does not utilize air travel , which is by far one of the most polluting forms of travel carbon-per-person-wise . the last time i was on a plane was in the early 1990s . back during the first 30 years of my life i was an ardent lover of air travel . i flew a lot and enjoyed the heck out of it . but then the joy seemed to drain away and i quit flying . so there\u2019s not much i can do to shrink my carbon footprint by cutting back on flying since i don\u2019t fly anyway . greta tries to never buy new clothes . she wears hand-me-downs from her older sister and also gets clothes from thrift stores . when i was a kid i absolutely hated being given hand-me-down clothes from my older brother . i simply refused to wear them . i didn\u2019t want his vibes on me . and for most of my life i would not even consider buying clothes at a thrift store . buying used clothes ? ewe gross ! right ? but over this last decade i have been slowly softening my hard-headed stance about this . it all started about 8 years ago when i needed a blazer for a certain event . i had burned all my ties and business suits way back when i quit the corporate world and i had zero money to buy a new blazer . so i bit the bullet and went to the local thrift store . to my surprise i found a blazer that was in mint condition that fit me perfectly . i bought it for $2 and when i got home i found a $5 bill in one of the pockets . i dare anyone to find a deal like that at any popular clothing retail fashion store . i have since shopped at the thrift store on a somewhat regular basis , mostly for household items and books and potential birthday presents for people under the age of 10 . but i have also bought some shirts and trousers and jackets . i even bought the first umbrella i\u2019ve ever owned at that thrift store . but to be honest i have to say that i vehemently draw the line at socks and underwear . i buy those at the nearby evil wal-mart . there is one part of greta\u2019s environmentally friendly lifestyle that i personally have trouble with , though , and that is the fact that she is a vegan . i just don\u2019t think i can take that step . over recent decades i have radically decreased my intake of meat \u2014 around 90% . i don\u2019t eat pork and i rarely eat beef or chicken but one of my favorite foods is organic , grass-fed bison meat . it\u2019s expensive , though , so i can rarely afford to buy it . but i still manage to have around 5 to 7 bison burgers a year \u2014 usually on special occasions or holidays . i feel good knowing the local rancher and his family who raise the organic , grass-fed bison and i know the spiritual ways in which they handle the entire harvesting process . and their ranch is only about 95 miles away so not much gas is used in transport . i know that i could take that step and give up meat entirely but there are two animal products that i simply cannot imagine giving up and those are organic , cage-free chicken eggs and organic real butter made from grass-fed cows . i consume those products almost every single day . egg yolks are probably my very favorite food in the world . i only eat the yolks , never the whites . 97 . 41869% ( approximately ) of all the nutrition found in an egg is in the yolk . and 99 . 03574% ( approximately ) of all the flavor of an egg is found in the yolk . the whites are useless and go in the compost bucket . there is no more orgasmic culinary experience than plopping a hot , yet still liquid , egg yolk into one\u2019s mouth and letting its yumminess explode with flavor throughout the mouth . and real , natural , organic butter made from grass-fed cows is perhaps the most crucially important food we can eat to maintain cardiovascular health . i like the fact that we don\u2019t have to kill the chicken to get the egg and we don\u2019t have to kill the cow to make the butter . the problem , of course , is that we think we must have huge factory farms to produce animal products to scale for an exploding population . ( \u2018scale\u2019 is my least favorite word in the american business lexicon . ) so i always try to \u2018source\u2019 organic , cage-free chicken eggs from local farmers , several of which i know personally who live just outside of town . i just don\u2019t think i can go 100% \u2018full greta\u2019 but i can get close . i can try . the important thing that i am grateful for about greta is that she has prompted me to make closer observations of my own actions in order to find new ways to help be a part of mitigating the effects of the climate crisis . very importantly , she is helping to expand mass awareness of how everyone can help . i give her my own personal nobel prize . but there is something that i\u2019ve never heard greta talking about\u2026 for years , many woo-woo masters have talked about how our outer environment reflects our inner environment . as the saying goes , \u2018as within , so without , \u2019 or something like that . the pollution in our outer environment is a reflection of the pollution within us so we cannot fix the outer pollution until we fix the inner pollution our psychological pollution , our emotional pollution , our collective attitudes and beliefs and self-loathing , our fear , our guilt , our hate , our prejudices , our greed\u2026 i\u2019ve been working on cleaning out my inner pollution for decades . every time i clean out some inner pollution i find more inner pollution that needs to be cleared out . i clear it out then find another layer of inner pollution that needs to be worked on . there are so many layers of inner pollution . sometimes i feel like a big old fat onion . but i keep working on it . so as we begin to observe our outer behavior in order to help heal the planet\u2019s environment we must also be sure to more closely observe our inner workings to see what can be healed within . i feel that we will achieve much greater and faster success by working both without and within simultaneously . one thing is for certain and that is that we simply cannot continue to go on in an unobserved path of somnambulist denial .","completion": " Greta Thunberg, a notable figure in the climate movement, has emerged as an inspiration and role model for many, including myself. Her thought-provoking actions and commitment to leading by example have motivated me to reflect on my own carbon footprint and consider further ways to reduce it. While I acknowledge that achieving the level of environmental dedication Greta demonstrates may not be feasible for everyone, I believe there is still room for personal improvement.\n\nOne area where Greta has made a significant impact is her choice to abstain from using fossil fuel-powered vehicles for transportation. Unfortunately, many Americans have become dependent on driving, even for short distances. I, on the other hand, have proudly lived without a car for the past six years, opting to walk instead. Walking not only eliminates pollution caused by vehicles but has also proven to be a cost-effective and beneficial choice for my overall well-being. While my decision to go car-less initially stemmed from financial constraints rather than environmental awareness, it has instilled in me a deeper understanding of the environmental implications of transportation choices.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that coerced actions, such as the abandonment of cars due to financial hardship, though they may contribute to a minimal decrease in environmental impact, are not as powerful as proactive choices made consciously and purposefully. Furthermore, Greta's decision to avoid air travel, a highly polluting form of transportation, has resonated with me. Although I have not flown since the early 1990s, I recognize the significance of reducing air travel for the sake of our planet.\n\nAnother aspect of Greta's environmentally-friendly lifestyle is her preference for second-hand clothing rather than purchasing new garments. I must admit that I have had reservations about second-hand clothing in the past, associating it with negative connotations. However, circumstances forced me to explore this option when I needed a blazer for a special event but lacked the financial means to buy a new one. To my surprise, I found a perfectly fitting blazer in mint condition at a local thrift store for a mere $2, and it even contained a $5 bill in one of the pockets. This experience opened my eyes to the value and potential savings in shopping at thrift stores. While I primarily visit thrift stores for household items and books, I have also managed to find some quality shirts, trousers, and jackets. Nevertheless, I maintain a personal distinction when it comes to socks and underwear, preferring to purchase those items from other retailers.\n\nOne aspect of Greta's lifestyle that I personally struggle with is her choice to be a vegan. While I have significantly reduced my meat intake, only consuming around 10% of the amount I once did, I find it difficult to completely eliminate certain animal products from my diet. Specifically, I deeply appreciate organic, cage-free chicken eggs and organic, real butter made from grass-fed cows. These products play a pivotal role in my daily meals, and the connections I have with local farmers who provide these sustainable options bring me a sense of reassurance. Although I acknowledge that I could potentially give up meat entirely, my affinity for these particular animal products prevents me from fully embracing a vegan lifestyle.\n\nWhile I may not be able to fully emulate Greta's choices, I am committed to making significant strides towards an environmentally conscious lifestyle. I recognize the importance of expanding mass awareness and applaud Greta for her efforts in spreading this message to a wide audience. It is essential to understand that addressing the climate crisis requires not only outer changes but also inner shifts. For years, there has been a belief among some individuals that our outer environment reflects our inner environment, emphasizing the need to tackle both simultaneously. By recognizing and working on our psychological, emotional, and collective attitudes, we can begin to clear out the inner pollution that hinders progress.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be challenging to attain a level of commitment comparable to Greta Thunberg's, her influence has undoubtedly encouraged me to reassess my actions and take a more active role in mitigating the effects of the climate crisis. It is vital for us to consciously observe and modify our behaviors both outwardly and inwardly in order to bring about meaningful change. By doing so, we can collectively work towards a more sustainable future, free from the somnambulist denial that perpetuates our current path. END"}

These tips have been circulating for decades or even centuries, yet despite the good intentions behind them, many of us still find ourselves tired, overworked, underpaid, and disorganized. It's easy to fall into the trap of self-blame, but I assure you, it's not your fault. The problem lies in the faulty information being propagated.\n\nThe human brain does not function like a machine that can be completely overhauled in one go. It is infinitely adaptable, and change is indeed possible for all of us. However, this change must occur in small increments, in tiny steps. Equally important is the need for your brain to genuinely believe in the actions you are taking. If your brain doesn't buy into it, your body won't follow through. It's as simple as that. You can repeat affirmations about how \"rich\" you are, but if your bank account remains empty, your brain will question the effectiveness of such affirmations. I'm sure you understand what I mean.\n\nIf you are an aspiring writer, or even if you simply have the desire to become one, there are only three things you need to do every morning. These are not grandiose or earth-shattering changes; they are just three small things. Firstly, take a few minutes for yourself. In his book \"Miracle Morning,\" Hal Elroy emphasizes how the way we wake up each day profoundly affects our entire day. We have all experienced those mornings when the alarm doesn't ring, or we wake up already late, causing a rush to get out the door and resulting in forgotten items and terrible traffic. These chaotic mornings have a way of setting the tone for the entire day. On the other hand, I experienced firsthand the positive impact of starting the day with a few quiet moments for myself when I was caring for my father during his final days. Balancing work and the responsibility of caring for a dying parent was certainly challenging, and if I started my day in a frantic state, responding to his immediate needs, I would end up feeling utterly drained. However, by waking up early enough to carve out some peaceful moments for myself, it made a world of difference in my overall well-being. It doesn't matter how you spend these moments; whether you watch the sunrise, feed the birds, read a book, or play solitaire, it is entirely up to you. The important thing is that you prioritize your own needs at the beginning of each day, rather than being solely consumed by the needs of others. END"}

However, once you have generated predictions by dragging algorithms onto your data, you need to determine which algorithm or combination of algorithms is most reliable for your task. In the ocean temperature tutorial, we utilized visual inspection to evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms, as the historical data roughly followed a sine curve. While visual inspection is a useful tool in the data science toolbox, there are other tools available as well. One such tool is the validation error rate, which can provide more nuanced insights when visual inspection alone is insufficient. Although there are various error functions that can be utilized, the validation error rate is the default error function in Monument.\n\nSo, what exactly is the validation error rate, and why is it important? The validation error rate measures the discrepancy between \"out of sample\" values and the estimates produced by the algorithm. This metric can be found in the info box located in the lower-left corner of the model workspace. In general, the more negative the validation error rate, the more accurate the model. Ideally, a perfect model would yield a negative infinity value. However, in real-world scenarios, achieving a small positive number might be the best possible outcome, as we observed with our ocean temperature data. Monument currently displays only one validation error rate at a time. To view the validation error rate for other trained algorithms, simply click the drop-down arrow on the right side of the algorithm pill and select \"show error rate.\" To facilitate comparison among different models, I have provided a table below showcasing all the validation error rates applied to the ocean temperature data, sorted from lowest to highest.\n\nAlgorithm Performance on the Habits Data\nBased on the tutorial, we found that with default parameters, AR and GYM performed the best on the cleaned and transformed data.\n\nNow, let's explore how to improve algorithm performance. Typically, we can enhance the validation error rate, i.e., make it \"more negative,\" by adjusting the algorithms' parameters. Access an algorithm's parameters by selecting \"parameters\" in the algorithm pill drop-down menu. Determining which parameters to modify in order to improve performance heavily relies on your business objectives and the nature of the data you are analyzing. Common cases will be covered in future tutorials, but the best approach is to experiment on your own to develop intuition regarding which parameters yield the most improvement for different types of data.\n\nCertain algorithms offer automated parameter adjustment. In Monument, the LSTM and Light GBM algorithms provide an option called \"AutoML,\" which stands for automated machine learning. AutoML automatically adjusts an algorithm's parameters to optimize performance. To access this capability, select \"AutoML\" from the algorithm drop-down menu. For instance, applying AutoML to the Habits data reduced the validation error rate from 3.273 to 3.233, yielding a modest improvement. However, in many cases, the gains can be far greater.\n\nMonument also offers other reports that can aid in enhancing algorithm performance, including dependent variables, forecast training convergence, and feature importance. These topics will be explored in detail in future tutorials. END"}

Quantum algorithms rely on the availability and connectivity of quits, and different models of quantum computers may implement this differently. This is similar to a program that runs on an Intel i7 processor but fails on the next generation processor. In quantum computing, a major issue is decoherence, which means that once a program is running, you cannot pause it and take a break. Once you hit the run button, you are on a countdown, and the program must finish quickly before the quantum information decays.\n\nIn this article, we will cover some implementation issues as well as the decoherence problem. The physical implementation of quits may not be symmetric, and the way a controlled-not gate operates may vary. For example, it may take qubit-0 as the control and qubit-1 as the target but not the opposite. This dependence on implementation can be seen in the example of connecting quits 1 and 2 with a controlled-not gate on IBM Q5, where an error occurs. By reshuffling the gates, the error is resolved. A similar example is shown for IBM Q20 Tokyo (20-qubits), and to overcome the limitations, we can use swapping to swap two quits.\n\nIn classical computing, the NAND gate is a universal gate that can build the remaining operations, and in quantum gates, a universal set can be approximated with high precision using NOT, H, S, and T gates. IBM Q (IBM QX4) implements several physical gates, and these operations are provided in the programming interface.\n\nNot all quits are of equal precision, and errors remain an issue in quantum computing. Different quits have different gate errors and readout errors. Gate error refers to the precision in applying a quantum gate, while readout error is the error in measuring quits. Multiunit gate error is the error in operating the 2-qubit gate. These factors should be taken into consideration when implementing an algorithm and documented for future comparison or reference.\n\nDecoherence is a critical process to be aware of in quantum computing. Since quantum information degrades over time due to interactions with the environment, your program must be completed before the quantum state becomes unreliable. Understanding the length of physical quantum gates used in your program, as well as how they are translated from logical gates, is helpful.\n\nThe quality of quantum computers can be measured by metrics such as relaxation time (T1), coherence time (T2), readout errors, and gate errors. These values are typically published to provide reference and insight into the decoherence process.\n\nFault tolerance is an important aspect of quantum computing. To mitigate errors, additional quantum gates can be added for error detection or correction. This is why we often need more quits than initially anticipated. One example of error correction is the encoder and decoder showcased by IBM, which allows for the correction of one quit error.\n\nNow that we have covered quantum gates, the next step is to learn how to program a quantum algorithm.

{"prompt": "this essay is about the way we design relationships between humans and machines \u2014 and not just how we design interactions with them ( though that is a part of it ) , but more broadly , what are the postures we have towards machine intelligences in our lives and what are their postures toward us ? what do we want those relationships to look and feel like ? as i\u2019ve been thinking through these ideas , science fiction characters are one of the lenses i\u2019ve been finding helpful as a way of thinking about different models for our relationships with machines . specifically , i\u2019ve been using these three \u2014 c3po , iron man , & r2d2 \u2014 as notable archetypes that describe different approaches to how we might design machine intelligences to engage with humans . c3po c3po is a protocol droid he\u2019s supposedly designed to not only emulate human social interaction , but to do so in a highly skilled way such that he can negotiate and communicate across many languages and cultures . but he\u2019s really bad at it . he\u2019s annoying to most of the characters around him , he\u2019s argumentative , he\u2019s a know-it-all , he doesn\u2019t understand basic human motivations , and often misinterprets social cues . in many ways , c3po is the perfect encapsulation of the popular fantasy of what a robot should be and the common failures inherent in that model . now this idea didn\u2019t emerge in 1977 . the idea of a mechanical person , a humanoid robot , has been around since at least the 1920s . eric the robot , or \u201ceric robot\u201d as he was more commonly known , was one of the earliest humanoid robots . he was pretty rudimentary , as you can see from the kind of critique that was leveled at eric by the new york times in the above quotes \u2014 it critiques his social demeanor and also questions his utility \u2014 why is a robot that moves and converses better that the one that can tell when the water levels in washington are too high ? is this the best form or use for a robot ? but despite these criticisms , people were fascinated by eric , as well as by the other early robots of his ilk , because it was the first moment that there was this idea , this promise , that machines might be able to walk among us and be animate . we\u2019ve had this idea in our social imagination for nearly a century now\u2014the assumption that , given sophisticated enough technology , we would eventually create robotic beings that would converse and interact with us just like human beings . our technology today is many orders of magnitude more sophisticated than eric\u2019s creators could have imagined . and we are still trying to fulfill this promise of a humanoid robot . we see the state of the art today with robots like sophia . this is so much closer to that humanoid ideal than eric was , but it falls so short and just feels awkward and creepy . on the software side ( \u201cbots\u201d vs . \u201crobots\u201d ) , we have examples of the failure of the c3po model in the voice assistants we use every day . they\u2019ve gotten pretty \u201cgood\u201d , but still can\u2019t understand context well enough to respond appropriately in a consistent way , and the interactions are far from satisfying . it turns out that even with incredibly rich computational and machine learning resources , interacting like a human is really hard . it\u2019s hard to program a computer to do that in any satisfying way because in many ways it\u2019s hard for humans to do successfully either . we get it wrong so much of the time . interacting like a human is hard ( even for humans ) . we don\u2019t all talk to each other the same way . we don\u2019t all have the same set of cultural backgrounds or conversational expectations . below are charts created by british linguist richard lewis to show the conversational process of negotiating a deal in different cultures . these challenges have come to the fore lately with everyone from search engines to banks trying to create convincing conversational interfaces . we see companies struggling with the limitations of this approach . in some cases they have addressed those challenges by hiring humans to either support the bots or in some cases actually pose as chatbots . welcome to 2020 , where humans pretend to be bots who are in turn pretending to be human . stop trying to make machines be like people obviously , the ideal of creating machines that interact with us just like people do is incredibly complicated and may actually be unattainable . but more importantly , this isn\u2019t actually a compelling goal for how we should be implementing computational intelligence in our lives . we need to stop trying to make machines be like people and find some more interesting constructs for how to think about these entities . the reason people started with the c3po model is because human conversation is the dominant metaphor we have for interacting and engaging with others . my hypothesis is that this whole anthropomorphic model for robots is fundamentally just a skeuomorph because we haven\u2019t developed new constructs for machine intelligence yet , in the same way that desks and file drawer metaphors were the first attempts at digital file systems , and when tv first emerged , people read radio scripts in front of cameras . instead , a more compelling approach would be to exploit the unique affordances of machines . we already have people . humans are already quite good at doing human things . machines are good at doing different things . so why don\u2019t we design for what they\u2019re good at , what their unique abilities are and how those abilities can enhance our lives ?","completion": " This essay explores the design of relationships between humans and machines, focusing not only on the interactions themselves but also on the broader postures and attitudes we have towards machine intelligences. It raises important questions about what we desire these relationships to look and feel like. To examine different models for our relationships with machines, the author looks to science fiction characters, specifically C3PO, Iron Man, and R2D2, as archetypes representing different approaches to designing machine intelligence interactions with humans.\n\nC3PO, a protocol droid, was designed to emulate human social interaction and communicate across various languages and cultures. However, he falls short in this regard, often being seen as annoying, argumentative, and lacking an understanding of human motivations and social cues. C3PO represents the popular fantasy of what a robot should be but also highlights the inherent failures of this model. The concept of a humanoid robot has been around since the 1920s, with early examples like Eric the Robot sparking fascination and the promise that machines could walk among us and display animal.\n\nToday, our technology has advanced significantly, and we still strive to fulfill the vision of a humanoid robot. Examples such as Sophia demonstrate progress in creating a more humanoid form, but they still fall short and can be unsettling. On the software side, voice assistants attempt to emulate human conversation, but they struggle to understand context and provide consistently satisfying interactions. The difficulty lies in programming computers to interact as humans do, a challenge that even humans themselves face due to diverse cultural backgrounds and conversational expectations.\n\nIt has become increasingly clear that striving to make machines interact like humans may be an unattainable and, ultimately, uninteresting goal. Instead of emulating human behavior, we should explore new constructs and approaches for machine intelligence. Human conversation has become the dominant metaphor for interaction, but it is limited and may be considered a skeuomorph. Just as desks and file drawer metaphors were initial attempts at digital file systems and early TV involved reading radio scripts, it is time to break away from anthropomorphic models and leverage the unique affordances of machines.\n\nRather than trying to make machines mimic humans, it is more compelling to design systems that harness the distinctive abilities of machines to enhance our lives. Humans are already adept at human activities, so why not focus on designing for what machines excel at and how their capabilities can complement and augment our own? It is time to shift our perspective and explore new models that embrace the unique potentials of machine intelligence. END"}

It explores the concept of \"safe\" versus \"endangered\" jobs. The jobs listed in each article serve as examples based on research and technological knowledge, but may not necessarily apply to every individual's specific situation. It is recommended that readers use them as references and inspiration, and begin to reimagine and re-strategize their careers in the context of our shared future powered by AI.\n\nTo determine whether a job is safe or unsafe from AI, several factors can be considered. Firstly, assessing whether your job involves minimal repetition of tasks and if you regularly generate valuable insights for your company. Additionally, considering the complexity of decision-making in your job and whether it requires continuously learning and understanding complex information can provide insights.\n\nIn terms of blue-collar jobs, evaluating whether it takes at least a year of training to qualify for the job and if it involves very little repetition of the same task should be considered. Furthermore, analyzing whether your job is performed in different environments each time or if your work environment is unstructured can be significant factors to take into account.\n\nAnother aspect that should be considered across all jobs is the level of human contact, empathy, and compassion involved. If communication and persuasion are essential parts of your job, if a significant portion of your work involves interactions with people not employed by your company (such as customers or partners), and if your job directly contributes to the happiness, safety, or health of those you serve, these factors may indicate a safer job.\n\nBased on these criteria, there are several jobs that are considered relatively safe from AI displacement. Psychiatrists, social workers, and marriage counselors, for example, rely heavily on strong communication skills, empathy, and the ability to gain trust from clients, which are areas in which AI currently falls short. Physical therapists, such as occupational, physical, and massage therapists, also require dexterity and personalized interactions that make their jobs resistant to AI.\n\nMedical caregivers, including nurses and those working in elderly care, are expected to see a substantial growth in demand due to various factors such as increased income, AI lowering the cost of care, and an aging population. While AI can assist with analytical and repetitive tasks in healthcare, the role of attentiveness, compassion, support, and encouragement in the healthcare profession will remain crucial.\n\nAs AI technology expands, there will be a growing demand for AI professionals, including researchers and engineers. However, it's important to note that over time, some entry-level positions in AI may become automated as AI tools continue to improve. Therefore, AI professionals should be prepared to adapt and keep up with the evolving technology.\n\nCreativity-driven professions such as fiction writers will remain in demand as AI struggles to replicate original ideas, engaging plots, and elegant writing styles. The entertainment industry is expected to thrive in the AI era, thanks to increased overall wealth and leisure time.\n\nTeachers will also continue to have an essential role in education, as AI can help personalize curricula based on individual student needs but cannot replace the human connection, mentorship, and social interaction that teachers provide. Future education will focus on helping students find their passions, develop independent learning abilities, and interact effectively with others.\n\nAlthough some tasks performed by paralegals and junior lawyers may be automated by AI, top lawyers will still be in demand due to their expertise in reasoning across domains, gaining trust from clients, and persuading juries. Similarly, while AI can assist with managing performance, good managers will continue to be valued for their human interaction skills, leadership abilities, and establishment of strong company culture and values.\n\nIn the field of science, AI will serve as a valuable tool for scientists, aiding in hypothesis generation, drug discovery, and data analysis. However, AI is unlikely to replace scientists' creativity and expertise.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI may impact certain jobs, there are many professions that will remain relatively safe due to the unique human skills and qualities they require. It is crucial for individuals to adapt, learn, and stay updated with the evolving technological landscape to thrive in the AI era. END"}

" The \"Picks for You\" module on 1688.com has evolved beyond being just a product recommendation channel. It now includes online promotions and marketing scenarios such as top-ranking products, must-buy lists, theme marketplaces, and discovery of quality goods. By incorporating marketing scenarios in the form of cards, traffic distribution is improved, and overall exposure gain is increased. This article provides insights on how to insert marketing scenario cards into the \"Picks for You\" display.\n\nCurrently, the marketing scenarios inserted into the \"Picks for You\" feature on the 1688.com app mainly consist of product collections. The focus is on metrics relevant to Internet Protocol Version (IPA) and exposure gain to measure model results. Exposure gain can be calculated by following the formula:\n\nExposure Gain = PV_CTR (in the case of only product recommendations)\n\nThe challenges faced include determining how to insert specific marketing scenario cards into product recommendations. In the initial stage, randomly attaching cards to recommended products with a certain probability was a common approach. However, this method disregards the capacity of cards and user preferences for different cards, resulting in lower exposure gain. Although this method helps gather initial data quickly, it significantly decreases metric values.\n\nTo address this issue, a weak personalization approach is adopted. This involves transforming a product into a card by assigning card quality and user preference scores. The card selection formula is then used to determine which type of card to use. Additionally, instead of relying solely on the product-card relationships provided by sellers, the provided collection of product-card pairs is filtered based on card quality scores. User preference scores for different card types are calculated offline, and both types of data are synchronized daily. Cards are inserted online once they are attached to corresponding products. It is crucial to carefully arrange the display frequency of cards to avoid excessive card appearances on one screen. This approach leads to an improvement in exposure gain compared to the results before iteration, although it is still lower than the base value without inserting any card. It is worth noting that even with multiple variations of the formula, limited improvement is observed.\n\nTo determine which card is most likely to generate clicks when several cards are available for a recommended product, a machine learning model is employed. The model aims to estimate the click-through rate (CTR) and selects the card with the highest estimated CTR. The final display results are subject to specific rules.\n\nFeatures such as user, item, and card characteristics are used as training examples for the sorting model. A total of 85 features, including real number, categorical, and cross features, are selected as model inputs. Real number features comprise statistical features of product Cars on the \"Picks for You\" platform, while categorical features are embedded before being inserted into the model.\n\nThe recall phase involves retrieving the candidate collection of product-card pairs from the \"Picks for You\" data. Currently, the mapping between products and cards relies solely on card quality scores and overlooks the relationship between products and cards. To overcome this limitation, an item theme mapping is implemented. The Swing algorithm is utilized to construct this method, considering an item-card pair as an item entity. Online A/B testing shows a positive impact on exposure gain after implementing this recall technique.\n\nA wide & deep model (WDL) is deployed as the sorting model for the final display, instead of the deep & cross network (DCN) used during iterations. A/B testing suggests minimal difference in exposure gain between the two models, with DCN slightly outperforming WDL.\n\nThe effectiveness of the current strategy is determined by the quality of card content and the precise distribution of cards for product recommendations. Compared to weak personalization, the current strategy improves exposure gain by 6.77% and increases the number of products clicked per user by 18.60%. Likewise, compared to the product recommendation method, the current strategy enhances exposure gain by 1.58% and improves the number of products clicked per user by 0.01%.\n\nThe system process involves online scheduling of product recommendations, which determines the overall product sequence, and the sorting model that decides which cards are attached to which products and where they are displayed. The flowchart of the online scheduling process includes both weak personalization and the machine learning module.\n\nIn situations where certain card types are missing, a card fallback and cold start mechanism is implemented. Up to one card is inserted for each missing card type based on pre-set probabilities, taking the interval policy into account. This approach ensures card fallback, cold start, and increases card diversity.\n\nMoving forward, plans involve further optimization of the model. Currently, it only serves as a card selector and does not consider the overall sequence of products and cards. The existing product recommendation results and the card selector will be utilized to train a mixed sorting model for overall sorting, taking into account clicks inside cards.\n\nOriginal source: [Link to original article] END"}

As Sean Covey once said, \"depending on what they are, our habits will either make us or break us. We become what we repeatedly do.\" However, building the habit of journaling is not as easy as one might think. It requires effort, patience, and consistency.\n\nWhen I started to incorporate journaling as a habit, I noticed that it had a positive impact on the development of other good habits in my life. It helped me become more patient with myself and allowed me to be mindful of my actions. It also helped me establish a more consistent workout routine. By observing patterns in my behavior over a few months, I was able to make conscious changes and distance myself from toxic aspects of my life.\n\nTo set myself up for success, I began with a small goal of writing just one sentence per day for a week. Starting small and gradually increasing the writing capacity proved to be an effective strategy. Diving headfirst into a new habit can be overwhelming, so it is essential to avoid overwhelming oneself. As time passed, I felt the urge to write more, so I removed any limitations on the amount of writing. However, to maintain consistency, I made sure to write at least one to three sentences on days when I felt less inspired.\n\nInitially, finding the right time to journal was a challenge. I experimented with writing in the morning, similar to morning pages, but there were days when my schedule didn't allow for it. So, I began writing before bed instead. I even tried using two separate journals for morning and evening entries, but it became too time-consuming and confusing. Eventually, I discovered the best time for me was to write as soon as I woke up. This allowed me to process my thoughts and experiences from the previous day and incorporate any dreams I had during the night. Having all my entries in one journal made it easier to revisit past months and reflect on my progress.\n\nIn terms of content, I explored different writing approaches. Initially, I treated journaling as a therapeutic outlet, freely expressing both positive and negative thoughts. It felt like a much-needed release. After a few weeks, I shifted my focus to gratitude and began writing about what I was thankful for in my life. I made a conscious effort to vividly visualize and describe these moments of gratitude, amplifying their impact. This exercise reminded me of the beauty around me and the strength I possessed.\n\nDuring the first three months of building this habit, I refrained from setting too many limits or boundaries. It was a trial-and-error phase, where I explored different approaches and techniques. Over time, I started gaining momentum and discovered what worked best for me.\n\nAfter four months, I established a consistent journaling routine that aligned with my schedule. Writing immediately after waking up proved to be most beneficial as it provided an opportunity to process thoughts and events from the previous day while incorporating any dreams I had. Maintaining one journal allowed for consecutive thoughts and streamlined access when I wished to reflect on past months.\n\nSome weeks, when I feel like I have little to say, I use themes or prompts to guide my entries. For instance, during weeks when I want to feel more grateful, I focus on writing reminders of what I appreciate. In weeks when I feel stuck or struggle, I write letters to the universe, seeking strength or visualizing myself as my future self, expressing gratitude for achieving my dreams. These letters are detailed, tapping into all my senses and reinforcing the belief that I have the ability to attain my goals.\n\nAs I continued to write consistently, I gradually increased the amount I wrote each week. By the third month, I could effortlessly write one full page without interruption, and now I can write multiple pages as effortlessly as writing a single sentence.\n\nIf you are looking to start your own journaling practice, I suggest beginning with small, achievable goals and gradually expanding as you become more comfortable. Find a consistent time that works well with your schedule, ensuring you have dedicated uninterrupted time for reflection. Experiment with different approaches and writing techniques to discover what resonates with you the most. Most importantly, be patient with yourself and approach journaling as a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. END"}

Notably, James Charles, in a video rant, urged his followers not to update their apps. The primary source of contention revolves around the new layout, which has relocated the fundamental options of the camera and notifications from the bottom menu bar to the upper-right corner of the home page, adjacent to the direct message button.\n\nThe updated bottom menu now prominently features the \"Reels\" option, emulating Instagram's competitor TikTok, as well as a \"Shop\" button. This means that these two options are readily accessible on every screen, while the camera and notifications buttons are only accessible in certain tabs. Instagram has stated its explicit intentions to prioritize Reels and its e-commerce platform over traditional posts on its blog. The company maintains that this change aligns with the rapid evolution of technology usage patterns. However, this approach appears to be imposing new intentions on users, rather than allowing for organic user behavior. It even leads to speculation whether we are witnessing the emergence of a new form of dark pattern.\n\nIn a previous article about dark patterns, I explained how Instagram employs the \"roach motel\" pattern. It is well-known that the company has previously employed dark patterns to achieve its objectives. However, if Instagram is genuine about its intentions with this update, it may not necessarily be classified as a dark pattern. The issue lies in the fact that the new bottom menu layout takes advantage of years of muscle memory developed by users. As a result, users have a significant likelihood of inadvertently clicking on the Reels or shop button when searching for the app's traditional features.\n\nUndoubtedly, Instagram possesses a competent user experience (UX) team capable of understanding the genuine needs and motivations of its users. It is highly probable that they were aware that users may not share the same level of interest in the features the company is trying to promote. This could explain why Instagram's official blog post seemed to anticipate users' disappointment.\n\nNow, I would like to hear your thoughts on Instagram's new update. Do you consider it unfair to the users or do you view it as a sound business decision? END"}

the reverse question is just as important how much time do we spend working on those new things that aren\u2019t generating revenue yet ? the three story rule every startup should have three stories , loosely related to the three arcs most storytellers use in episodic storytelling . an easy way to think about it is a television series . when you watch an episode of a tv show , the writers are usually working on three storylines story a story with an arc that begins and ends in this episode ( or maybe a two-parter ) . story b story with a longer arc that lasts a few episodes or more . this current episode will advance the plot of story b in smaller increments , and maybe drop a twist in here or there . story c story with a much longer arc , maybe out to the end of the season or the end of the series itself . this current episode might not advance story c at all , or it may just drop a few hints . at the end of the season or the series , you\u2019ll be able to look back and piece story c together , but that won\u2019t be easy or even possible in real time . now let\u2019s take that story strategy and apply it to your startup , and i\u2019ll use my most recent startup as an example . story a right now story a is the what your company is doing today that is generating revenue , building market share , and adding value to the company . story a is about this fiscal quarter , this fiscal year , and next fiscal year . at automated insights , story a was our story for the first few years while we were known as statsheet , a company that aggregated sports statistics and turned them into visualizations and automated content . this is how we made our money \u2014 either using our own data to generate content or using data like yahoo fantasy football to generate fantasy matchup recaps . while we were breaking new ground in the arena of sports stats , we were one player in a sea of players , and while automating content from sports stats gave us a competitive advantage , sports was still a highly commoditized and difficult marketplace . story b what\u2019s next story b is what\u2019s going to open up new markets using new technologies or new products . story b is about what you could do if the stars aligned properly or if you raised enough money for a longer runway , because story b usually comes with a lot more risk for a lot more reward . a few years into statsheet , when we went to raise our series a round , we pitched using our proprietary automated content engine on all kinds of data , generating machine-written stories in finance , marketing , weather , fitness , you name it . we changed our name to automated insights and pivoted completely with a $5 million raise . that pivot came with a ton of risk . we had friends ( and potential acquirers ) in sports and we would now be making sports just a part of our story . in return , we would be one of the first players in the nascent natural language generation ( nlg ) market , a pre-cursor to the \u201cai\u201d market . it was not a coincidence that the acronym for our new company name was also ai . story c the billion-dollar story story c usually involves a seismic change that disrupts existing markets , and as you can imagine , it\u2019s a million times more difficult to pull off . uber and lyft are on story c . they\u2019re no longer known as a better taxi or for solving a specific problem . they\u2019re about creating a market in which a large portion of people can no longer live without them . in most urban areas , ride hailing services are now a necessity , as the ability they offer to do more things cheaply has made a major impact on lifestyle . there\u2019s just no going back . story c was actually where my vision split from my former startup . i was focused more on real-time , plain-word insights generated from a mesh of private and public data , i . e . alexa , google assistant , and siri . the company was turning towards more of a b2b approach , first as a saas nlg tool , and then as a business intelligence tool . no one was wrong here , but the latter was the direction the company took . so now i\u2019m working on a new story a at a new startup . and i\u2019ve got stories b and c in my purview . so which story do you tell ?

While the question of what our company does may seem simple on the surface, the reality is that our goals and aspirations are rarely straightforward. Over my 20+ years as an entrepreneur, I have learned the importance of maintaining focus on current tasks while simultaneously keeping an eye on the future. This balance becomes particularly critical when planning for the long-term success of our endeavors.\n\nEntrepreneurs often find themselves blurring the lines between what their startup currently is, what it will become, and what it should be. Initially, this fluidity is acceptable but becomes challenging when trying to formulate cohesive plans. That is when we need to ask ourselves: What are our priorities today, and how can we execute them without jeopardizing our future? Equally crucial is determining the amount of time we dedicate to developing new ideas that may not generate immediate revenue.\n\nTo address these challenges, I propose that every startup adopts the three-story rule. This rule is loosely based on the three-arc structure commonly used in episodic storytelling, which we can relate to a television series. When you watch an episode of a TV show, you often find three storylines unfolding simultaneously:\n\n1. Story A: This is a self-contained arc that begins and concludes within a single episode or a short two-part segment. In the context of our startup, Story A represents what we are currently doing to generate revenue, build market share, and add value to our company. It encompasses the immediate fiscal quarter, year, and the subsequent year.\n\n2. Story B: This storyline has a longer arc, spanning multiple episodes or more. In our startup, Story B is what we aspire to do next to explore new markets using innovative technologies or products. This story carries more risk but also offers significant rewards if successfully executed. It requires careful consideration of aligning resources and potentially securing additional funding.\n\n3. Story C: The grand narrative that disrupts existing markets and introduces a seismic change. This is the most challenging storyline to tackle, but it has the potential to reshape industries. Story C represents a vision that transcends solving a specific problem or offering incremental improvements. It aims to create a market where our product or service becomes a necessity that people cannot live without.\n\nNow, let's apply this storytelling strategy to our own startup, using my previous venture as an example. Initially known as Stat sheet, our company aggregated sports statistics and transformed them into engaging visualizations and automated content. This formed Story A, which sustained us during the first few years. However, we realized that the sports market was highly competitive and commoditized.\n\nHence, we ventured into Story B, opting for a significant pivot and a $5 million raise. We rebranded as Automated Insights, shifting our focus to leveraging our proprietary automated content engine on various data sets beyond sports alone. Exploring new markets through natural language generation and AI became our new mission.\n\nAs for Story C, my personal vision deviated from the path my former startup embarked upon. While I envisioned real-time, plain-word insights generated from a combination of private and public data, the company gravitated towards a B2B approach, evolving into an SaaS NLG and business intelligence tool. Both approaches had their merits, but the latter became the direction the company pursued.\n\nNow, in my current startup, I am crafting a new Story A, all while overseeing and strategizing Stories B and C. The question arises: which story to tell? The answer depends on the audience. When speaking to the press, customers, and potential employees, Story A should take center stage. If these individuals are not enthused about Story A, it might signal a need to invest more time and energy into its development. Stories B and C, on the other hand, should be treated as intellectual property, shared only under appropriate circumstances and legal protection.\n\nFor our board, investors, and employees, focus primarily on Story A, but also ensure they are aware of Stories B and drop hints about Story C. Story B represents our future trajectory and could potentially be the catalyst for raising our next funding round or initiating a significant pivot. Story C, however, remains a goal, something to keep in mind without closing doors to its realization.\n\nOnce our stories are defined, success lies in execution. Regularly revisiting and updating these narratives, at least on a quarterly or sprint basis, ensures everyone remains aligned and pursuing the same objectives.

For most, it's a dish enjoyed without a second thought, but for some, like myself, it evokes a deep-rooted phobia. This may seem peculiar, as society readily accepts aversions to snakes, spiders, or even certain movies. However, my fear of baked beans, known as leguminophobia, is just as real and impactful. \n\nMy anxiety surrounding baked beans is no laughing matter. The sight of them causes a physical reaction - my stomach churns, my face tightens with anxiety, and even my shoulders tense up. The crows' feet around my eyes seem to age me beyond my years. I often wonder why I can't tear my gaze away from this repulsive dish. Yet, it is a known fact that it can be challenging to turn away from unsettling things, and baked beans have a peculiar hold on my attention, albeit in the worst possible way. \n\nShould we not treat this phobia with the seriousness it deserves, I can't help but draw a parallel between baked beans and David's battle with Goliath. Unfortunately, laughter has become the standard reaction when my phobia is revealed, and I have had to come to terms with this over the years. While others may find aversions to more common objects, such as snakes, spiders, or specific movies, socially acceptable, I am well aware that my detestation of a low-cost and widely consumed foodstuff is rather peculiar. It is traumatic for me to acknowledge that baked beans coexist in the same world as I do, let alone people choosing to consume them as food. \n\nBritish baked beans, particularly the renowned Heinz variety, come conveniently premade in a tin. The shiny, silver packaging may seem rudimentary, but it boasts a sturdiness that could break a toe or even a brick without blemishing. Upon opening, a cold, shiny, tomato-based red loop is unleashed, glistening even in the dimmest of light. It's perplexing how such a sight can cause my eyes to squint. The taste, overly sweet and artificial despite being free of additives, only adds to the repulsion. The beans themselves, labeled haricot beans, possess a dry center and a mushy texture that clings unrelentingly to one's teeth when chewed. And the unique smell they emit through flatulence is unmistakable. How many times have the words, \"Did you eat baked beans today? It smells like you did,\" reached my nostrils. \n\nThe genesis of my phobia can be traced back to my childhood home, where baked beans were an acceptable dish at any time - breakfast, lunch, or as a side dish for dinner. They were omnipresent. I vividly recall my brother mistakenly warming them in the microwave for too long, rendering the bowl nearly untouchable due to scorching heat. But what truly scarred me was the thin layer of red skin that formed due to excessive heating. My brother nonchalantly scraped it off with a spoon, flicking it into the bin before taking a mouthful. This episode became trauma in its purest form for me. \n\nIn my family home, baked beans were touted as a remedy for regularity, causing my mother to exclaim, \"They keep you regular.\" For me, it was just another reason, adding to the exhaustive list, to despise them. When I observe someone consuming baked beans without any concern, I can't help but feel sorry for their loved ones who will inevitably be in the presence of this human airbag later on. The unique scent emitted by the beans is as sinister as it is distinctive. \n\nWatching baked beans infiltrate and infect every other item on the plate is all-engrossing for me, much like the experience of anaphylaxis for someone stung by a bee. It seems that the bean 'just' is unable to be confined to one section of the plate, regardless of one's efforts. I recall seeing a valiant attempt by someone building a dam of sausages and toast to save their mushrooms from drowning in the bean \"just.\" Alas, their effort was in vain. The only plausible way to segregate one's food from baked beans and their insidious fluid would be to consume them in a separate bowl, free from any distractions. However, this would necessitate the ingestion of a spoonful of pure baked beans, accommodating neither taste nor texture. \n\nEven after the meal is eaten, my torment is far from over. A single bean somehow manages to evade its bio bin grave, left sitting innocuously on the table amidst a thin layer of smeared sauce. It taunts me, still gleaming in the light, causing me to squint once again. When finally wiped away, the bean's weak structure is crushed against the cloth, delivering yet another insult. Should I have the misfortune of washing the dishes, the dishwater itself takes on a reddish tint, and the sink strainer reveals a pale, naked bean stripped of its coating. \n\nA world without baked beans would undoubtedly be a better one for those of us afflicted with leguminophobia. Can we collectively agree to seek fiber and protein from alternative food sources? Such a compromise would undoubtedly bring immeasurable happiness to our lives. END"}

With around five percent of the conference papers dedicated to graph-related topics, there is plenty to discuss.\n\nOne noteworthy topic is the power of knowledge graphs in training data extraction attacks. A recent paper, authored by experts from major big tech companies, demonstrates how language models like GPT-2 can be attacked to extract information such as personal identifiable data. This alarming technique involves querying the model and extracting information from its training data, which is often derived from scraped internet sources. The paper delves into the causes of this issue and proposes possible solutions.\n\nAnother interesting development is Book Me Some Data, where Booking.com is seeking a new recommendation engine. As part of this endeavor, they are offering their dataset of over 1 million anonymized hotel reservations to professionals who want to work with real-world data. The dataset includes various fields such as user ID, reservation check-in and check-out dates, affiliate ID, device class, booker country, hotel country, city ID, and unique trip identification.\n\nFor those interested in UFO research, Archive.org has recently made available a collection of UFO files spanning several decades and countries. This data dump resulted from a copyright dispute between content owners and media publishers, ultimately leading a third party to acquire and upload the files. This resource could prove valuable for researchers exploring topics such as antigravity propulsion technology.\n\nIn the realm of AI, the US Air Force has integrated DeepMind's zero into the navigation/sensor system of a U-2 \"Dragon Lady\" spy plane, naming it Artur. This integration was inspired by the iconic R2-D2 from Star Wars. A simulated flight was recently conducted to showcase Artur's capabilities, focusing on conducting reconnaissance of enemy missile launchers while the pilot addressed aerial threats.\n\nGitHub has announced an update to its code search index. Repositories that have been inactive for more than a year will be removed from the index. To maintain activity status, a repository must have had a commit or appeared in a search result.\n\nAlan Nichols hares his thoughts on the state of conversational AI and the NASA platform in relation to eliminating intents. The goal is to achieve Kurzweil-like levels of robustness by experimenting with end-to-end learning as an alternative to intents. In future versions of NASA, intents will become optional.\n\nLastly, Fair's XLSR-53 Multilingual Self-Supervised Speech Transformer and Multilingual Pre-Trained Wav2Vec 2.0 models, along with the WMT'20 News Translation Task submission models, are now available on the Cypher repository. These resources offer opportunities to explore the intersections of speech and language processing in a multilingual context.\n\nThese are some recently released repositories that have captured our attention.

aspects of aws .","completion": " In the current era, the transition to e-commerce is occurring rapidly. Both small and large e-commerce companies strive to keep their websites up and running 24/7, 365 days a year to avoid losing customers and business. A prime example of this is the impact experienced by Amazon.com when their website goes down for even a couple of hours. This is where cloud computing comes into play, offering the agility to build highly available (HA) and fault-tolerant applications, something that was not feasible with on-premise data centers.\n\nCloud vendors have data centers located across multiple geographical locations, providing redundancy and enabling the development of HA websites. The same concept applies to any business-critical applications that require continuous operation. Currently, AWS (Amazon Web Services) global infrastructure covers 21 geographical regions with 66 availability zones (AZ), and there are plans for further expansion in the near future. In this article, we will focus on building HA applications in the cloud, specifically in AWS.\n\nAWS global infrastructure consists of regions, availability zones, data centers within the AZ's, and edge locations. Each region represents a geographical area with multiple isolated locations called availability zones. An availability zone can comprise one or more data centers. For example, the North Virginia region (code: us-east-1) has six availability zones. AWS offers a range of global and region-specific resources. For instance, IAM (Identity and Access Management) users are global, while EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances are regional.\n\nTo ensure HA, each AZ has its own data centers, distributed across different locations. For instance, in the Mumbai region (code: ap-south-1), AZ ap-south-1a might be situated in the east of Mumbai, while ap-south-1c is in the west. This geographic distribution helps to mitigate the impact of natural disasters such as floods or fires on the availability of the data centers. Additionally, each data center maintains redundant power supplies, UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) systems, routers, and internet connectivity to avoid any single points of failure. The data centers are not interconnected; instead, they rely on high-speed internet connections for low-latency communication.\n\nWhen creating resources in AWS, users have the option to choose the desired region and AZ, but not the specific data center within an AZ. The selection of an AWS region depends on factors such as pricing, security and compliance requirements, user/customer location, service availability, and latency. For learning purposes, the North Virginia region is often recommended as it is one of the cheapest regions and typically the first to support new AWS features.\n\nIn addition to regions and AZ's, AWS global infrastructure includes edge locations. These locations are primarily used for caching static and streaming data. Currently, AWS has a global network of 187 points of presence, including 176 edge locations and 11 regional edge caches, situated in 69 cities across 30 countries. In comparison to AZ's, the number of edge locations is nearly tripled and closer to the end-users. Edge locations offer lower latency compared to regions. When a user makes a request, the edge location checks if the data is already cached locally. If not, it retrieves the data from the appropriate region, stores it locally, and then delivers it to the user. The term \"edge location\" is specific to AWS and is associated with the AWS CloudFront service. Similar services are provided by content distribution network (CDN) providers such as Akamai and Cloudflare.\n\nBy leveraging AWS global infrastructure, it is possible to create highly available and fault-tolerant applications. Hosting a web server in a single AZ can make the website vulnerable to outages if that AZ experiences issues. To mitigate this risk, deploying the web server across multiple AZ's within the same region can ensure continuity. However, even regional outages can render a website inaccessible. To further enhance availability, deploying the web server across multiple regions eliminates single points of failure and ensures uninterrupted service. Building highly available websites and applications involves utilizing redundancy, which does come at a cost. Running the same website in multiple locations requires additional resources. Alternatively, one can deploy the same web server on other cloud platforms like GCP or Azure. This configuration, where the same application is deployed on multiple clouds, is known as multi-cloud configuration. Google Ant hos is a tool that facilitates the development of hybrid and multi-cloud applications using Kubernetes. When deploying web servers across multiple locations, it is essential to have a mechanism for distributing traffic across them. AWS Elastic Load Balancers (LB) fulfill this role, distributing requests from end-users to multiple web servers.\n\nIn conclusion, while setting up our own data centers provides the flexibility to design and configure hardware and software precisely, it is accompanied by significant time and financial investments. By leveraging AWS, one can create highly available, secure, fault-tolerant, reliable, and performant applications with just a few clicks or API calls. Major cloud vendors like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have invested billions of dollars in setting up data centers across different geographical locations.

From the lack of support for parents and teachers grappling with an unprecedented school year to the tragic loss of over 300,000 lives and the impending eviction crisis impacting millions, it is undeniable that our government has failed us in every possible way since we first recognized the gravity of this pandemic.\n\nThe fact that there is even controversy surrounding another stimulus check for the American people is a testament to the alarming apathy displayed by our elected representatives. A mere glance at the unemployment Subreddit on Reddit provides a glimpse into the dire circumstances many individuals face. Tales of desperation, like those expressed by users who are on the verge of homelessness or struggling to secure basic needs such as food, are profoundly distressing.\n\nIn a consumer-driven economy such as that of the United States, the stability of the economy is intertwined with the ability of average Americans to engage in spending. Consequently, the direct relief payments, commonly referred to as stimulus checks, become vital instruments for survival rather than mere economic stimuli. Repeated encounters with stories like the ones narrated above can leave one with an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and anger.\n\nFor months, I have pondered what it would take for the American people to rise up, whether it be through mass demonstrations or a general strike, demanding that the basic needs of its citizens be met in the wealthiest nation on Earth. However, when we consider the daily struggles of millions of people, it becomes understandable that they lack the time and energy to organize. It should not surprise us that people have become conditioned to such cruelty, as lawmakers feel entirely at ease subjecting their constituents to unnecessary trauma while holding their stability hostage. Sadly, the longer this situation persists, the less likely it becomes that any amount sent as relief will be sufficient to help individuals catch up on their piling bills and overdraft fees, let alone stimulate the beloved economy that lawmakers claim to prioritize.\n\nAmidst this all, the wealth of the richest individuals in the country has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, with one study indicating that a one-time wealth tax could generate enough funds to distribute a $3000 check to every American, leaving the elite with more money than they possessed before the pandemic. In stark contrast, single mothers, who lost their jobs due to the circumstances that enhanced the fortunes of the wealthy, find themselves depleting their bank accounts and accumulating overdraft fees just to procure diapers for their babies. One cannot help but wonder when our lawmakers will exhibit genuine concern for the plight of their constituents. What will it take for them to comprehend the suffering and anguish that tens of millions of people are currently enduring? How much more must we, the American people, endure before they recognize that these checks are not a frivolous luxury but an absolute necessity?\n\nIn this critical moment, it is vital that our lawmakers set aside political games and prioritize the immediate welfare of their constituents. Adequate and comprehensive support is crucial for our nation to navigate these extraordinary circumstances. The American people deserve better than this. END"}

I thought it would be fitting to bring along a 4-pack of Corona lager as a lighthearted joke. It turns out, I wasn't the only one with this idea. Sales of Corona lager in the US surged by 28.8% in March 2020. Drink market analysts at ISR attribute this increase to the \"tongue-in-cheek\" social media memes that made humorous connections between the brand and the virus. In the UK, sales of Corona beer have experienced a 40% increase this year, marking the second-largest growth among all lager brands.\n\nThis surge in popularity can be attributed to the fact that Corona is already a widely recognized and trusted brand. As brand consultant Henry Far explains, \"When so much of people's lives are uncertain, consumers will look to brands they are familiar with and trust.\" This trend is seen across the industry, with alcoholic beverage sales also soaring during the early stages of stay-at-home orders. Corona beer, as the world's biggest lager brand, has managed to outperform most of its competitors.\n\nThe irony is that the link between Corona beer and the coronavirus, stemming from social media memes, actually worked in favor of the brand. Market experts believe that this unexpected association led to a significant spike in sales compared to other lager brands. While it's not always true that no publicity is bad publicity, in this case, it certainly seems to have helped Corona beer.\n\nHowever, the initial impact of the pandemic was not positive for the brand. In the first quarter of 2020, Corona beer experienced its worst performance in decades. Fears surrounding the virus and reduced time spent in bars resulted in a decline in sales. Google search trends at the time also showed a clear link between the virus and the beer. Additionally, production of the beer was temporarily halted due to lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe similarity in names between Corona beer and the coronavirus can be attributed to the term \"corona\" which means \"crown\" in both Spanish and Latin. The label of Corona beer features a crown, while the coronavirus is named after the crown-like spikes observed on the virus itself.\n\nIt's worth noting that the World Health Organization advises against naming viruses after locations, individuals, or anything that could lead to blame. This approach is to avoid creating stigmatization around specific places or groups. Therefore, it's important to emphasize that there is no actual link between Corona beer and the virus, except for their shared name.\n\nIn conclusion, Corona beer has experienced a significant surge in sales despite the initial setback caused by the pandemic. The brand's recognition and trustworthiness, along with the social media irony surrounding its name and the virus, have contributed to its newfound popularity. It is safe to enjoy Corona beer responsibly, as there is no factual connection between the beverage and the coronavirus. END"}
{"prompt": "a little bit of organisation goes a long way . i would like to share with you some organisational practices i have evolved that in my experience make it quicker to move from a python/boto3 prototype to a production automation tool . to demonstrate them i am going to walk through the creation of a python class that uses the aws cost explorer api via boto3 to return the total cost of an account . maybe this particular use case is useful to you , maybe not in any event , it provides a good way to share some effective working practices . prototype using multiple jupyter notebooks i am sure many of you are already using jupyter notebooks for prototyping automation tools . the way the output is shared dynamically in the notebook alongside your code makes it great for exploring functionality you may not be fully familiar with . something that may be new to you is you can run one notebook within another . the code to do this is %run another-notebook . ipynb now i am not suggesting you get carried away with this functionality but i am suggesting when developing a new automation tool you use a structure of three notebooks , namely a notebook for your functions and/or classes a notebook to test your program with %run to include your classes/ function notebook a notebook to run you program with %run to include your classes/ functions notebook you could call the notebooks \u201crun\u201d , \u201ctest\u201d and \u201cmy-class\u201d defining our a demo tool ( application ) i consider myself a \u201ctoolmaker\u201d hence the use of the word tool rather than application but i am sure you get what i mean . our demonstration tool will accept a session ( you could be using access keys or assuming a role to access a target account ) an end date the number of days to go back from the end date the tool will provide the total cost for the account identified in the profile for the time period defined by the inputs . for this article , i have left it there . i have not extended the design to send the answer somewhere else . you could let your imagination run wild , providing your answer to the world through an api or sns\u2019ing it to a more select crowd . write a failing test first , we need a use case to test against . i suggest using one month ' s costs . you can get the total cost for the target account from cost explorer via the console . you will hardcode the date of the first day of the next month , the number of days in the month , and the result i . e . the cost you get from cost explorer . let ' s say you choose the month of october ( with 31 days ) , your code in the \u201ctest\u201d notebook will look like this %run my-class . ipynb ce_test_value=123 . 00 assert accountcost ( mysession , ' 2020-11-01 ' , -31 ) . cost \\ == ce_test_value , ' failed total cost test ' as intended it will fail ( in many ways ) . the value for ce_test_value is the cost you looked up via the console in cost explorer . put a message in to make it clear it\u2019s the assertion that failed and which one it is in case you end up with more than one . there are two main reasons that the current test is failing the \u201cmy-class . ipynb\u201d notebook containing the definition of the class \u201caccountcost\u201d does not exist you have not define any way for the program to connect to a target account connecting to the target aws account if you are running locally i am assuming everyone is familiar with using access keys that are defined in a local ~ . aws/credentials file to access accounts . my suggestion when doing this is don\u2019t create the keys for the user you normally use to login to the console . rather create a user specifically for the tool you are creating , create access keys for it and use those access key to create a named profile in your ~ . aws/credentials file along the lines of the following [default] aws_access_key_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx aws_secret_access_key=aaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbb [my-named-profile] aws_access_key_id=yyyyyyyyyyyyyy aws_secret_access_key=cccccccccccccdddddddddddd this will mean you can define the profile you want to use explicitly in your program rather than relying on the default . you will be able to switch between accounts within your program and if you later want to assume a role moving to this will be less disruptive to your code . for the new user you have created you are going to have to define an access policy . i think sometimes \u201cleast privilege\u201d seems like a lot of hard work to figure out exactly what actions you need to allow . it is easier than you maybe think to find out what action you must allow . simply create a blank policy , don\u2019t allow anything , run your program , and generally the error message will tell you exactly what action you need to allow . in this case , i will put you out of your misery by giving you the policy you require which you can attach as an inline policy . here it is { version 2012-10-17 , statement [ { effect allow , action [ ce getcostandusage ] , resource * } ] } generally , i would prefer using an aws-managed policy but in the case of using the cost and usage api , none of the obvious candidates do the job and are in fact overly permissive for this narrow use case . so now we have a way to connect to the target aws account we can amend the \u201ctest\u201d code to accommodate this as follows import boto3 # set the profile to be used profile_name= ' my-named-profile ' my_session = boto3 . session ( profile_name=profile_name ) %run my-class . ipynb ce_test_value=123 . 09 assert accountcost ( my_session , ' 2020-11-01 ' , 31 ) . cost \\ == ce_test_value , ' failed total cost test ' the only thing left to do is to create the class notebook and define the class within it . class to get your account costs from cost explorer via boto3 the class assumes input of session date until days back you can create the notebook \u201cmy-class\u201d and add the following code import boto3 from dateutil import parser as p from dateutil . relativedelta import relativedelta as rd class accountcost def __init__ ( self , session , mydate , mydays ) # cost explorer requires region to us-east-1 client = session . client ( ' ce ' , region_name= ' us-east-1 ' ) #convert input end date from string e_date=p . parse ( mydate ) end_string= \\ f ' {e_date . year}-{e_date . month 02}-{e_date . day 02} ' #calculate start date s_date = ( e_date + rd ( days=mydays ) ) #convert start date to string start_string= \\ f ' {s_date . year}-{s_date . month 02}-{s_date . day 02} ' #get cost from cost explorer api response = client . get_cost_and_usage ( timeperiod={ ' start ' start_string , ' end ' end_string } , granularity=daily , metrics=[ unblendedcost , ] ) #total up days between start and end date total_cost=0 . 0 for day in response[ ' resultsbytime ' ] total_cost=total_cost+float ( day[ ' total ' ] [ ' unblendedcost ' ][ ' amount ' ] ) #return result as string with two decimal points self . cost=f ' {total_cost . 2f} ' parsing the date makes the solution a little more robust in that it will accept a variety of date formats , standardising them in the program . putting it all together having saved the \u201cmy-class\u201d notebook you can go back to the \u201ctest\u201d notebook and now run you run it you should get no errors . note you will need to take into account that in order accommodate the technique used to fix the float to two decimals your test value needs to be converted to a string ( f\u2019{ce_test_value}\u2019 ) . if in fact , you get nothing this means the assertion passed with the result of instantiating your object equals that of the value you retrieved using the console from cost explorer . now you can create the \u201crun\u201d notebook and yes at this stage it will look suspiciously similar to the \u201ctest\u201d notebook . here is my version # set the profile to be used profile_name= ' my-named-profile ' my_session = boto3 . session ( profile_name=profile_name ) %run my-class . ipynb print ( accountcost ( my_session , ' 2020-11-01 ' , 31 ) . cost ) the benefit you have gained is that not only have you tested your class but you can also try things out in the \u201ctest\u201d notebook as you develop your prototype further before incorporating them into your \u201crun\u201d notebook . i hope you found this approach useful in stimulating your own thoughts on how to approach your next tool building exercise . any thoughts or suggestions please feel free to reach out to me .","completion": " A bit of organization can go a long way when it comes to transitioning from a Python/Boto3 prototype to a production automation tool. In this article, I will share some organizational practices that I have found effective in expediting this process. To illustrate these practices, I will walk you through the creation of a Python class that utilizes the AWS Cost Explorer API via Boto3 to retrieve the total cost of an AWS account. While this specific use case may or may not be relevant to you, it serves as a valuable example to showcase these effective working practices.\n\nPrototype using multiple Jupyter notebooks:\nMany of you are likely already using Jupyter notebooks for prototyping automation tools. The ability to share dynamic output alongside your code makes Jupyter notebooks excellent for exploring unfamiliar functionality. One feature that you may not be aware of is the ability to run one notebook within another. You can accomplish this by using the `run` command followed by the filename of the notebook. While it's important not to overuse this functionality, it can be beneficial when developing a new automation tool. I recommend structuring your notebooks into three categories: one for your functions and/or classes, one for testing the program using `run` to include your class/function notebook, and one for running the program using `run` to include your class/function notebook. You could label these notebooks as \"run,\" \"test,\" and \"my-class,\" respectively.\n\nDefining our demo tool (application):\nI consider myself a \"toolmaker,\" which is why I refer to this project as a tool rather than an application. The demo tool we will create will accept a session (using access keys or assuming a role to access a target AWS account), an end date, and the number of days to go back from the end date. The tool will provide the total cost for the account identified in the profile for the specified time period. For the purpose of this article, I will not extend the design to send the answer elsewhere. However, you have the flexibility to explore various options, such as providing the answer through an API or notifying a select audience via SNS.\n\nWrite a failing test first:\nIn order to test our tool, we need to define a use case. I suggest using the total cost for one month as our test scenario. You can retrieve the total cost for the target account from the Cost Explorer via the AWS Management Console. To set up the test, you will need to hardcore the date of the first day of the next month, the number of days in the month, and the resulting cost you obtained from the Cost Explorer. Let's assume we choose the month of October (with 31 days) for our test. The code in the \"test\" notebook would look as follows:\n\n```\nrun my-class.IPYNB\nCE_test_value = 123.00\nassert account cost(my_session, '2020-11-01', -31).cost == CE_test_value, 'Failed total cost test'\n```\n\nAs intended, this test will fail in many ways. The `CE_test_value` is the cost you looked up via the Cost Explorer console. By adding a descriptive message, you can easily identify which assertion failed in case there are multiple failures.\n\nConnecting to the target AWS account:\nAssuming you are running the program locally, I will assume that you are familiar with using access keys defined in a local `~/.AWS/credentials` file to access AWS accounts. My suggestion is to create a separate user specifically for the tool you are creating. Create access keys for this user and use them to create a named profile in your `~/.AWS/credentials` file. Here is an example of how the named profile should look:\n\n```\n[default]\nAWS_access_key_id = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nAWS_secret_access_key = aaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbb\n\n[my-named-profile]\nAWS_access_key_id = yyyyyyyyyyyyyy\nAWS_secret_access_key = ccccccccccccccdddddddddddd\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to explicitly define the profile you want to use in your program, rather than relying on the default profile. It also allows you to easily switch between AWS accounts within your program. Additionally, if you later decide to assume a role, transitioning to this approach will be less disruptive to your code. For the newly created user, you will need to define an access policy. While \"least privilege\" may seem like a daunting task, it's actually quite simple to determine the necessary actions. Create a blank policy that doesn't allow any actions, run your program, and the error message will typically indicate the specific action you need to allow. In this case, I will provide you with the policy you require, which you can attach as an inline policy:\n\n```\n{    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [        {            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [                \"CE:GetCostAndUsage\"\n           ],\n            \"Resource\": \"*\"\n       }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nNow that we have a way to connect to the target AWS account, we can update the \"test\" code to accommodate this:\n\n```\nimport boto3\n\n# Set the profile to be used\nprofile_name = 'my-named-profile'\nmy_session = boto3.session(profile_name=profile_name)\n\nrun my-class.IPYNB\n\nCE_test_value = 123.09\nassert account cost(my_session, '2020-11-01', 31).cost == CE_test_value, 'Failed total cost test'\n```\n\nCreating the class to get account costs from Cost Explorer via Boto3:\nThe class assumes the input of a session, date, and number of days to go back. You can create a notebook named \"my-class\" and add the following code:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom dateutil import parser as p\nfrom dateutil.relative delta import relative delta as rd\n\nclass account cost:\n    def __unit__(self, session, my date, maydays):\n        # Cost Explorer requires region to be set to 'us-east-1'\n        client = session.client('CE', region_name='us-east-1')\n\n # Convert input end date from string\n        e_date = p.parse(my date)\n        end_string = f'{e_date.year}-{e_date.month:02}-{e_date.day:02}'\n\n # Calculate start date\n        s_date = (e_date + rd(days=maydays))\n        \n # Convert start date to string\n        start_string = f'{s_date.year}-{s_date.month:02}-{s_date.day:02}'\n\n # Get cost from Cost Explorer API\n        response = client.get_cost_and_usage(            TimePeriod={'Start': start_string, 'End': end_string},\n            Granularity='DAILY',\n            Metrics=['UNBLENDEDCOST'],\n\n # Total up the daily costs\n        total_cost = 0.0\n        for day in response['ResultsByTime']:\n            total_cost += float(day['Total']['UnblendedCost']['Amount'])\n\n # Return the result as a string with two decimal points\n        self. Cost = f'{total_cost:.2f}'\n```\n\nParsing the date in this manner ensures that the program can accept a variety of date formats and standardizes them for further processing.\n\nPutting it all together:\nAfter saving the \"my-class\" notebook, you can return to the \"test\" notebook and run it again. This time, you should encounter no errors. Keep in mind that in order to fix the float value to two decimal places, your test value needs to be converted to a string format (`f'{CE_test_value}'`). If the assertion passes, and you get no output, it means that the object instantiation matches the value you obtained from the Cost Explorer console.\n\nNow, you can create the \"run\" notebook, which will resemble the \"test\" notebook at this stage:\n\n```python\n# Set the profile to be used\nprofile_name = 'my-named-profile'\nmy_session = boto3.session(profile_name=profile_name)\n\nrun my-class.IPYNB\n\nprint(account cost(my_session, '2020-11-01', 31).cost)\n```\n\nThe benefit of this setup is that not only can you test your class, but you can also experiment with ideas in the \"test\" notebook as you further develop your prototype before incorporating them into your \"run\" notebook.\n\nI hope you find this approach useful in stimulating your own thoughts on how to tackle your next tool-building endeavor.

dictate behavior. It is extensively used in expert systems, automated planning, and action selection, and serves as a means of providing artificial intelligence. In this article, we will delve into the different aspects of a production system in artificial intelligence, including its definition, features, control/search strategies, rules, classes, advantages, disadvantages, and an example.\n\nA production system, also known as a production rule system, is a computer program primarily designed to facilitate artificial intelligence. It consists of a set of rules that govern behavior, along with the necessary mechanisms to enforce those rules as the system reacts to changes in the environment.\n\nThe major components of a production system in artificial intelligence include a global database, which serves as the central data structure utilized by the system. This database stores information that the production rules operate upon. The set of production rules itself operate on the global database, with each rule typically having a precondition that determines whether it can be applied or not. When a rule's precondition is satisfied, it is applied, leading to changes in the database. Additionally, a control system is responsible for selecting which rule should be applied and halting computation when a termination condition is met. If multiple rules are eligible for application simultaneously, the control system resolves conflicts.\n\nThe key features of a production system in artificial intelligence are simplicity, modularity, modifiability, and knowledge-intensive. The structure of each sentence in a production system follows a consistent \"if-then\" structure, enhancing simplicity in knowledge representation. Modularity allows for the knowledge to be treated as independent facts that can be added or removed without adverse effects. Modifiability enables the development of production rules in a skeletal form, allowing customization for specific applications. The knowledge base of the production system contains pure knowledge, devoid of control or programming information.\n\nControl/search strategies are crucial in deciding which rule to apply when searching for a solution to a problem. A good control strategy should engage motion, be systematic, and efficient in finding optimal solutions.\n\nProduction system rules can be classified as deductive inference rules or abductive inference rules, where a condition is followed by an action. They go by different names such as condition-action, antecedent-consequent, pattern-action, situation-response, and feedback-result pairs.\n\nThere are four major classes of production systems in artificial intelligence:\n\n1. Monotonic production systems: The application of a rule in this system does not prevent the later application of another rule that could have also been applied at the initially selected moment.\n\n2. Partially commutative production systems: In this type of system, the application of a sequence of rules transforms one state into another, and any permissible permutation of those rules yields the same transformation. Theorem proving falls under this category.\n\n3. Non-monotonic production systems: These systems are useful for solving ignorable problems and don't require backtracking to previous states when incorrect paths are discovered. They increase efficiency by not tracking changes made in the search process.\n\n4. Commutative systems: These systems are suitable for problems where changes can be reversed, and the order of operations is not critical. They find applications in domains like chemical analysis, where the order of operations is critical.\n\nThe advantages of production systems in artificial intelligence include modularity, separation of knowledge and control, pattern-directed control, heuristic search opportunities, and suitability for state-driven machines and real-time applications. However, they have limitations such as the absence of learning and the need for careful conflict resolution between rules.\n\nTo illustrate the concept of a production system in artificial intelligence, let's consider the example problem of obtaining 4 liters of water in a 5-liter jug using a 5-liter and a 3-liter jug. The production rules for this problem involve filling and emptying the jugs in specific sequences. The solution with the minimum number of steps is chosen.\n\nIn conclusion, the production system plays a significant role in artificial intelligence, providing a rule-based mechanism for behavior control. It offers simplicity, modifiability, and knowledge-intensive features, and employs control/search strategies to find optimal solutions. While it has advantages in modularity and heuristic control, it also has limitations related to learning and conflict resolution. END"}
{"prompt": "just as in the previous posts , i\u2019ll leave the rigorous maths for the companion notebook , and stick to explaining the general idea . just like self-organising feature maps , gngs are iterative algorithms . however , unlike sofms , they do not require any initial specification of the number of neurons \u2014 as the name suggests , gngs are growing , and new neurons keep getting added as long as the algorithm is running . each iteration begins by picking a data point from the training set . because gngs generalise very well to an arbitrary number of dimensions , it is common to speak of these in terms of \ud835\udeff-length vectors v . the neuron nearest to v , called the best-performing unit ( bpu ) in analogy to sofms , is moved closer to v . all neurons directly connected to the bpu are also moved closer to v . determine the second-best performing unit ( sbpu ) . if the bpu and sbpu are connected , set the age of this connection to zero . if they are not connected , connect them . then increment the age of all other edges emanating from the bpu . if an edge has an age larger than the maximum age amax , delete the edge . if this results in \u2018orphan neurons\u2019 ( neurons with no edges connecting them ) , these are also deleted . every \u03bb iterations , the neuron with the largest cumulative error ( sum of distance from each data vector v over each iteration ) is identified as the worst-performing unit ( wpu ) . insert a new neuron halfway between the wpu and its worst-performing neighbour and delete the original edge between the wpu and its worst-performing neighbour . iterate until some boundary condition , such as maximum number of iterations is reached . it\u2019s simple to understand how this algorithm works , but it\u2019s worth spending some time on thinking about why it works . as you might have noticed from the examples above , this method creates a partitioning of the space where the data is distributed , and does so by approximating a delaunay triangulation ( indeed , in his original paper , fritzke referred to the graph generated by a gng as an \u2018induced delaunay triangulation\u2019 ) . the idea of a growing neural gas algorithm is that unlike a sofm , which requires some idea of how many neurons are required to represent the data , gng determines where the model has been performing worst so far , and refines that area . this eventually results in a model that grows not uniformly but rather to expand the size of the graph where it can no longer cover ( quantise ) the data with the given resolution ( number of neurons ) . using gng to count clusters in the first introductory part to competitive neural networks , i have already introduced a use case for gngs , namely as quick and efficient vector quantisation algorithms that create decent approximations of images . in the following , we\u2019ll be looking at something slightly different , namely counting distinct objects and quantifying their sizes . hard and soft exudates on a fundoscopy image from the diaretdb1 data set ( kauppi et al . , 2007 ) . the diaretdb1 data set by the research group of kauppi et al . at lappeenranta university of technology contains 89 digital fundoscopy images , that is , images of the fundus of the eye , of five healthy volunteers and 84 people with some degree of diabetic retinopathy . in diabetic retinopathy , a complication of diabetes that affects the small blood vessels of the retina , long term inadequate blood glucose control leads to vascular damage , microaneurysms and exudates , where lipids ( causing bright yellow hard exudates ) or blood ( resulting in pale , diffuse yellow soft exudates ) have accumulated on the fundus . in the following , we\u2019ll be using gng to quantify these abnormalities . the diaretdb1 data set contains roi ( region of interest ) masks , but those merely outline areas that show a particular clinical feature . can we use growing neural gas to count how many clusters of hard exudates are present in the regions of interest ? you bet ! isolating the roi using consensus masks the consensus mask of at least two experts\u2019 votes ( bottom right ) is generated from the original roi annotations ( bottom left ) . this mask is used to isolate the region of interest from the fundoscopy image ( top left ) , resulting in a masked image ( top right ) . we begin with some image processing , namely by refining the area of interest . each image was labelled by four experts , which created a mask . we can threshold the mask so as to require consensus by a given number of experts , a trick widely used in annotated research imagery ( scroll to the bottom if you\u2019re unfamiliar with it ! ) . then , we use the relatively prominent bright yellow colour of hard exudates to convert them to data points the gng can begin to characterise ( for the nitty-gritty , do refer to the companion notebook , where some of the added tricks , including some morphological transforms , are explained ) .","completion": " In the previous posts, I have discussed the general idea of Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithms. Similar to Self-Organizing Feature Maps (Sofas), Gangs are iterative algorithms. However, Gangs do not require an initial specification of the number of neurons. As the name suggests, Gangs are growing algorithms, where new neurons are continuously added while the algorithm is running. \n\nEach iteration of the GNG algorithm begins by selecting a data point from the training set. Gangs are known to generalize well to an arbitrary number of dimensions, and thus, we refer to these data points as lengthvectors v. The neuron nearest to v, which is called the best-performing unit (BPU), is then moved closer to v. In addition, all neurons directly connected to the BPU are also moved closer to v. \n\nThe algorithm also involves determining the second-best performing unit (SBPU. If the BPU and SBPUare connected, the age of this connection is set to zero. If they are not connected, they are connected, and the age of all other edges emanating from the BPU is incremented. If an edge's age exceeds the maximum age (aMax, it is deleted. If this deletion results in orphan neurons (neurons with no connecting edges), these neurons are also deleted. \n\nEvery \u03bb iterations, the neuron with the largest cumulative error (sum of the distance from each data vector v over each iteration) is identified as the worst-performing unit (WCPU. A new neuron is inserted halfway between the WCPUand its worst-performing neighbor, and the original edge between them is deleted. This process is iterated until a boundary condition, such as reaching the maximum number of iterations, is met. \n\nThis algorithm is simple to understand, but it is worthwhile to consider why it works. As demonstrated in the examples above, this method creates a partitioning of the space where the data is distributed. It does so by approximating a DDelaneytriangulation. In fact, in the original paper by FFritz the graph generated by GNG was referred to as an \"induced DDelaneytriangulation.\"\n\nThe key idea behind the Growing Neural Gas algorithm is that, unlike SSofas which require an estimation of the number of neurons needed to represent the data accurately, GNG determines the areas where the model has been performing the worst and refines those areas. This eventually leads to a model that grows non-uniformly to expand the size of the graph in areas where it can no longer cover the data with the given resolution (number of neurons).\n\nIn my previous article on Competitive Neural Networks, I introduced the use case of GGangsas quick and efficient vector quantization algorithms for creating decent approximations of images. In the following sections, we will explore a slightly different application of GGangs specifically counting distinct objects and quantifying their sizes.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's consider the example of hard and soft exudates on a fendoscopyimage from the DiaretDB1 dataset by the research group of KKauaiet al. at Lappeenranta University of Technology. The dataset contains 89 digital fendoscopyimages of the eye's ffunds consisting of five images from healthy volunteers and 84 images from individuals with different degrees of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nIn diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that affects the small blood vessels of the retina, inadequately controlled blood glucose levels over the long term lead to vascular damage, microaneurysms, and the accumulation of lipids or blood in the form of hard and soft exudates. \n\nTo begin quantifying these abnormalities using GNG, we first isolate the region of interest (ROI) using consensus masks. These masks are generated by combining annotations from multiple experts, and they outline regions that exhibit specific clinical features. By using consensus masks, we can extract the ROI from the fendoscopyimage.\n\nAt this stage, we employ image processing techniques to refine the ROI. Each image in the dataset was labeled by four experts, creating a mask for each image. We can apply a threshold to this mask to require consensus from a certain number of experts. This approach is commonly used in annotated research imagery. \n\nSubsequently, we leverage the relatively prominent bright yellow color of hard exudates to convert them into data points that can be characterized by the GNG. For further details and a deeper understanding of the technical aspects, I encourage you to refer to the companion notebook where additional techniques, including morphological transforms, are explained.

( internally it\u2019s a hashmap from search term to a bitset . ) the search term can be either the metric name like cpu . usage or tag key value pair like host=host1 . having this inverted index engine , we can quickly do and , or , not , wildcard and regex operations , which has also reduced many unnecessary lookups compared to original opentsdb scan based querying . aggregation after retrieving data from storage engine , comes the step of aggregation and construction of final result . we initially tried opentsdb , using its built-in query engine . the performance degraded heavily as all the raw data need to go on network and also those short lived objects cause a lot gc . so we replicated opentsdb\u2019s aggregation layer inside goku . we also pushed the calculation as early as possible minimize the data on the wire . a typical query flow is as follows a query from statsboard client ( pinterest\u2019s internal metric monitoring ui ) goes to any proxy goku instance the proxy goku fanout the query to related goku instances within the same group based on the sharding configuration each goku reads inverted index to get related time series ids and go on fetching their data each goku aggregates the data based on query , like aggregator , downsampler and etc proxy goku does the second round of aggregation after gathering results from each goku and returns to the client performance compared with previously used opentsdb/hbase solution , goku performs much better in almost all aspects . here is another latency graph focusing on high cardinality queries before and after using goku . what\u2019s next disk-based storage for long-term data goku ultimately will support queries longer than one day . for longer term queries like one year , we don\u2019t put as much emphasis on what happened at one second , but rather look at the overall trend . therefore , we\u2019ll do downsampling and compaction to merge hourly buckets into longer term buckets , which reduces the data size and improves query performance . goku phase #2 \u2014 disk based data includes index data and time series data replication currently we have two goku clusters doing double writes . this setting gives us high availability when there are issues in one cluster , we can easily switch traffic to another . however , because the two clusters are independent , it\u2019s hard to ensure data consistency . e . g . , if writes to one succeed while fail on the other , data will become inconsistent . another drawback is failover is always cluster level granularity . we\u2019re working on log based intra-cluster replication to support master slave shards . this will improve read availability , preserve data consistency and failover in shard level granularity . analytics use case analytics is widely needed for all industries and pinterest is no exception . questions like experiment results and ads campaign performance are being asked every minute . currently we mainly use offline jobs and hbase for analytics purpose , which means no real-time data , and a lot of unnecessary pre-aggregations . because of the time series data nature , goku could easily fit it and provide not only real time data , but also on demand aggregation . we\u2019ll continue exploring the use cases for goku . if projects like this are of interest to you , check out our careers page ! acknowledgements huge thanks to brian overstreet , wei zhu from visibility team and , paul bindels and chiyoung seo for helping rolling out goku and the design advices .","completion": " By Run Zhang, Engineer at Storage & Caching, co-authored by Jinan EU, Jean Wang, and Tanning Chang, Engineers at Pinterest. \n\nDevelopers at Pinterest rely on Stats board to monitor their systems and identify any issues. A reliable and efficient monitoring system is crucial for maintaining development velocity. In the past, we used OpenBSD to ingest and serve metrics data. However, as Pinterest has grown, the number of services has increased from hundreds to thousands, generating millions of data points every second. The performance of OpenBSD began to degrade, causing operational overhead such as serious garbage collection (GC) issues and frequent crashes of HBase.\n\nTo address these challenges, we developed Roku, our in-house time series database written in C++. Roku is designed to support efficient data ingestion and efficient time series queries while remaining compatible with OpenBSD APIs.\n\nRoku follows OpenBSD's time series data model, where a time series is composed of a key and a series of numeric data points over time. The key includes the metric name and a set of tag key-value pairs. For example, \"TC.pro.stat.CPU.total.infra-goku-a-prod{host=infra-goku-a-prod-001, cell_id=aws-us-east-1}\". Each data point consists of the key and its corresponding value, which is a timestamp-value pair, such as (1525724520, 174706.61), (1525724580, 173456.08).\n\nA time series query in Roku includes the metric name, filters, aggregators, down sampler, rate option, and start time and end time. Filters are applied to tag values to reduce the number of time series selected in a query. Roku supports various types of filters, including exact match, wildcard, OR, NOT, and regex. Aggregators specify the mathematical way of merging multiple time series into a single one, such as sum, max/min, avg, issue, count, and dev. Down samplers require a time interval and an aggregator to compute a new data point across all the data points in the specified interval. The rate option can optionally calculate the rate of change. For more details, please refer to the OpenBSD data model.\n\nRoku addresses several limitations in OpenBSD, including unnecessary scanning, data size, single machine aggregation, and serialization. Roku replaces OpenBSD's inefficient scan with an inverted index engine. It achieves 12x compression through Gorilla compression. Roku's new query engine moves computation closer to the storage layer, enabling parallel processing on leaf nodes before aggregating partial results on the root node. Roku uses Thrift binary for serialization instead of JSON, which improves performance when there are many data points to return.\n\nIn terms of architecture, Roku utilizes the Facebook Gorilla in-memory storage engine to store the most recent data from the past 24 hours. Time series are divided into different shards called bucket maps. Each time series is also divided into buckets, with a configurable duration (internally set to 2 hours). In each bucket map, each time series is assigned a unique ID and linked to a buckettimeseries object. The buckettimeseries object holds the most recent modifiable buffer bucket and storage IDs to immutable data buckets in the bucket storage. After the designated bucket time, data in the buckettimeseries is written to the bucket storage and becomes immutable. To achieve persistence, bucket data is written to disk, stored on an NFS, enabling easy shard migration.\n\nRoku adopts a two-layer sharing strategy. It applies hashing on the metric name to determine the shard group to which a time series belongs. Then, hashing is applied to the metric name + tag key-value sets to determine the specific shard within that group. This strategy ensures balanced data distribution across shards. Each query only goes to one group, reducing network overhead and tail latency. Additionally, each shard group can be scaled independently.\n\nRoku's query engine supports querying by specifying tag keys and tag values. For example, to retrieve the CPU usage of a specific host (host1), a query can be sent as CPU. Usage{host=host1}. Roku implemented an inverted index to support these types of queries, enabling quick operations such as AND, OR, NOT, wildcard, and regex, thereby reducing unnecessary lookups compared to OpenBSD's scan-based querying.\n\nAfter retrieving data from the storage engine, Roku performs aggregation and constructs the final result. We replicated OpenBSD's aggregation layer inside Roku to minimize network traffic and reduce garbage collection. A typical query flow involves the Stats board client sending a query to any proxy Roku instance, which then fans out the query to relevant Roku instances based on the sharing configuration. Each Roku instance reads the inverted index to retrieve related time series IDs and fetches the corresponding data. Each Roku instance aggregates the data based on the query's requirements, such as the aggregator and down sampler. The proxy Roku instance performs a second round of aggregation after gathering results from each Roku instance and returns it to the client.\n\nRoku significantly outperforms the previously used OpenBSD/HBase solution in terms of performance. Even high cardinality queries show improved latency after transitioning to Roku. \n\nLooking ahead, Roku's future plans include supporting queries for longer than one day. For longer-term queries, such as one year, down sampling and compaction will be implemented to merge hourly buckets into longer-term buckets, reducing data size and improving query performance. Additionally, we are working on log-based intra-cluster replication to support master-slave shards, ensuring read availability, data consistency, and shard-level failover.\n\nRoku also enables real-time analytics, which is essential for industries like Pinterest. Currently, we rely on offline jobs and HBase for analytics, resulting in no real-time data and unnecessary pre-aggregations. Roku can easily accommodate time series data and provide real-time data and on-demand aggregation.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a simple and interactive dashboard using Panel. We will be using Jupyter Notebook to develop the dashboard and serve it locally. Panel is an open-source Python library that allows you to create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text.\n\nTo create interaction with datasets or plots in Panel, the easiest way is to use the `interact` function. This function automatically generates an interactive control and serves as a flexible and powerful method for creating dashboards. Let's take a look at a simple example using `panel.interact`. In this example, we will create a function that returns the product of a number, and then we will call `panel.interact` on the function.\n\n```python\nimport panel as PN\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x * x\n\nPN.interact(f, x=10)\n```\n\nNow, we have an interactive control where we can drag a slider and observe the product changing as we modify the value of `x`. The `panel.interact` function is easy to use and works well with controls, data tables, visualizations, or any Panel widget. While it provides a high-level approach, the inner workings are hidden, and customizing the dashboard layout requires indexing. However, it serves as a clear and robust starting point.\n\nIf you desire more control over your dashboards and wish to customize them entirely, you can employ reactive functions or callbacks within Panel. In our dashboard, we will utilize a more powerful function called `depends on`.\n\nBefore we proceed with creating the dashboard, let's explore the three key components in Panel that we will be using:\n\n1. Pane: A Pane allows you to display and arrange plots, media, text, or any other external objects. You have access to almost all Python plotting libraries' functionalities, so you can utilize your favorite plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib, Both, Vega/Altair, Colonies, Plot, Forum) within Panes. Additionally, you can use markup and embed images with a Pane.\n\n2. Widget: Panel provides a consistent and extensive range of widgets. You can choose from different types of widgets, including options selectors for single and multiple values (e.g., select, radio button, multi-select) and type-based selectors (e.g., slider, checkbox, dates, text).\n\n3. Panel: A Panel offers flexible and responsive customization for dashboard layouts. You can create fixed-size or responsive resizing layouts when building dashboards. Panel provides four main types for layouts: row (horizontal layouts), column (vertical layouts), tabs (selectable tabs' layout), and grid spec (grid layout).\n\nIn the next section, I will demonstrate how to create a dashboard with interactive controls, data visualizations, and customized dashboard layouts.\n\nLet's proceed to the creation of the Flood Dashboard using Panel.\n\nIn this example, we will utilize a global flooding dataset from the Global Active Archive of Large Flood Events, provided by the Flood Observatory Unit in Dartmouth. Before constructing the dashboard, we will first read the data and explore it. END"}

I am grateful to have a close relationship with my adult son, who willingly spends countless hours in the car with his mom. Like any memorable vacation, our journey has been filled with music and heartfelt conversations, packed with exciting activities - including an evening concert at the renowned Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado. This trip has allowed me to deviate from the usual path and immerse myself in much-needed inspiration and a break from my daily routine.\n\nHowever, amidst all the excitement, there is one aspect of my routine that I miss and require on a daily basis - my quiet time. In this season of my life, I am fortunate enough to have extended periods of solitude and tranquility, a luxury I never had while working full-time or raising young children. As a self-employed individual, I have the choice to interact or isolate myself as I see fit. Consequently, on an average day, at least half of it is spent in silence, punctuated only by the gentle tapping of my keyboard as I write, or the occasional barking of my beagle when she spots a barn cat where she shouldn't be. I consciously refrain from turning on the television, radio, news shows, or background music. Silence is a necessity to me because it allows me to truly listen.\n\nSilence provides the necessary gaps in life, the stillness that my mind craves. When bombarded with constant input, my head becomes congested, overwhelmed with thoughts that are not my own, nor my muse's. It is in silence that I can receive the words I need to write. Rather than actively seeking them, I listen attentively, paying heed to the sentences that emerge fully formed in my mind. I carefully transcribe them and patiently await their direction. This is the realm of margins, empty spaces, or what some may refer to as white space. What I have discovered is that grace fills these empty spaces. \n\nUnlike an editorial calendar that guides my writing process, I rely on ideas and story starters. The space between these fragments and the finished written piece, one that truly resonates with readers, is a vast expanse that only grace can fill. It is through the lens of grace that we bridge the gaps in our relationships when hurt is sustained. It allows us to navigate the differing perspectives and polarized positions that sometimes seem insurmountable. Grace acts as a tether, keeping us connected even when words fail to communicate our love for a child or a parent. \n\nYet, grace requires space in which to manifest itself. Just as letting go reveals our next step, refusing to fill the gaps reveals grace. One of the preachers I once heard explained theological grace as the filler for the disparity between God's ideal for mankind - love without judgment, forgiveness without measure, and selflessness without reluctance - and our feeble attempts to embody these qualities. Whatever aspect falls short, grace bridges the gap, no matter its width or depth, or how far we feel we have fallen from the ideal. Grace is fluid, ever-changing, and versatile, connecting hearts and dots where language alone falls short. It is a love language that cannot be perfected, only received and cultivated. However, grace necessitates empty spaces in order to manifest itself fully. \n\nToo often, we find ourselves lacking grace because we try to fill the gaps on our own. We substitute grace with pride, insisting that we are right while demanding others move towards us. We attempt to bridge these gaps through nagging, coercion, manipulation, and control. Yet, these efforts only widen the divide, further carving unbridgeable chasms. In our despair, we neglect to seek grace. It is interesting to note that Jesus always asked those who approached him variations of the question, \"What do you want?\" not to make them beg or embarrass them, but to reveal that they were powerless to mend what was broken, tip the scales of justice, or heal their own bodies. By asking for grace, we acknowledge the truth that grace is what we all truly need.\n\nI often ponder why we live in a society that is consumed with noise, constantly bombarding our ears with words and our eyes with images. I believe it stems from our oldest human flaw - pride. We are too proud to sit with gaps, foolishly convinced that we have the power to fix what is broken, master our inadequacies, and exert full control over our lives. We stubbornly cling to this illusion with boastful words, attempting to demonstrate our importance. After all, important people do not need grace. \n\nOur closets are overflowing, our calendars crammed, and our mental space stifled with continuous stimulation and information. We have forgotten the art of stillness, and our children rarely experience the freedom of boredom. We meticulously plan from one end to the other, filling every available margin. But where can grace reside in such a crowded existence? \n\nSarah Ban Reattach once said, \"I think we need to learn how to tolerate more empty spaces.\" Perhaps we truly believe that we do not need grace if we can fill all the gaps on our own. The \"be more\" mentality, the constant hustle to achieve, does not leave room for grace. It incessantly shouts that we were created for greater things, urging us to set more goals and raise the bar. In this perspective, grace becomes superfluous, for we are the architects of our own lives. Yet, in reality, we need grace when we allow ourselves to be transformed and molded into the image of a holy God. Grace and space are crucial prerequisites and ongoing requirements in the journey of personal transformation. God is not impressed by resumes or outward appearances. As stated in 1 Samuel 16:7, \"Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\"\n\nI encourage you to examine your gaps, cracks, and spaces. Instead of attempting to fill and mask them, consider what it would be like to acknowledge them and invite grace to fill them. Grace is not just a concept we casually discuss; it requires intentional acceptance into our lives. If grace truly is enough to fill the empty spaces, then why do we force ourselves to stuff and cram every corner of our existence? Let us reflect on the words we speak, the opinions we hold, and the activities we engage in. Are they truly filling and lifting us, or are they draining us in the long run? Let us not perceive moments of downtime as a failure of productivity. Instead, let us embrace stillness and the freedom it brings. Perhaps the reason we fear empty spaces, silence, unanswered questions, and unproductive time is because we have not yet learned to receive grace fully. END"}

corporations and governments for making necessary changes. Often, we argue that there is no point in us altering our behaviors until they do. However, we tend to overlook the importance of individual actions in the climate conversation. The choices we make in areas such as transportation, diet, and household energy use have significant impacts.\n\nIn order to drive true societal transformations, individuals must be at the heart of it. The way we use energy in our homes contributes significantly to global emissions. In the UK, for example, 40% of total emissions come from households, with about half of household emissions resulting from electricity and heating. Despite the importance of these choices, they remain an area that lags behind.\n\nThere are several ways individuals can reduce their carbon footprints in terms of energy use in the home. Switching to green energy providers, installing smart meters to monitor consumption, and upgrading current technologies are all effective means of reducing our individual impacts. However, implementing these changes is often easier said than done.\n\nFor instance, many net-zero plans by towns, cities, and countries rely on the assumption that buildings will be retrofitted. A study conducted in Michigan in 2015 aimed to retrofit 7,000 eligible households, offering them energy-efficient upgrades for free. Surprisingly, less than 1% of households accepted the offer. Even after significant efforts to inform households of the benefits and zero costs, acceptance of the offer only increased to 6%. These results cast doubt on the effectiveness of incentives in driving behavior change.\n\nFinancial benefits, such as subsidies for electric vehicles in Norway, can act as useful incentives in certain circumstances. However, it is not always the most important factor motivating individuals. Another study on energy efficiency in the United States illustrates this point. Researchers tested different messaging strategies on energy consumption over a year. Some households were sent messages highlighting the financial savings that could be achieved, while others received messages about the environmental and health impacts of energy usage. Surprisingly, households that received messages about monetary benefits consumed the same amount of energy, while those receiving messages about the health consequences of energy consumption reduced their consumption by 18% to 30%. This demonstrates that making climate change a personal and emotional issue can facilitate behavioral change.\n\nA similar approach was taken in the UK with the introduction of energy performance certificates (EPC) in 2008. These certificates, which provide energy efficiency grades for buildings, were meant to educate individuals on energy efficiency. However, when analyzing 16,000 homes, researchers found that many properties clustered at the lowest score of certain categories, particularly in homes that had recently been on the market. This indicated that sellers made minor energy efficiency changes to improve their grades and potentially increase property value. This highlights the need for better education on energy efficiency and emphasizes the importance of understanding the psychological factors that drive behavior. Whether it is immediate financial benefits, expected returns from selling a house, or knowledge about health improvements, understanding what motivates people to make choices and change their behaviors is crucial.\n\nUndeniably, influencing people's home energy use is challenging. It is easier to comprehend the impact of our behaviors when it comes to driving, flying, or consuming certain foods, as these actions are more tangible. We can see the smoke from car exhaust pipes and the fuel tank being filled, and we can even interact directly with the foods we eat. However, heating or cooling a building is less perceptible. We simply flick a switch or turn a dial, and the temperature changes through pipes we seldom see.\n\nTo address this issue, some experts suggest providing showrooms to introduce consumers to smart heating technology, developing a database to showcase real-world energy performance, and creating tools for comparing upfront and running costs to better inform the public. Nonetheless, we cannot turn our back on individuals as change-makers. The control we have over our habits is enough to make a significant global change. By taking the initiative in areas such as energy use in our homes, we can pave the way for larger changes at the corporate and government levels to follow suit. END"}

until there\u2019s only one walker left . let me be clear , i\u2019m under no illusions that my runs are comparable . after all , i can stop and go home whenever i like . that\u2019s precisely what makes my runs challenging \u2014 by having no external motivation to keep going , the decision to push on or call it a day is entirely mine . so , i think of that line regularly pick \u2018em up , put \u2018em down . pick \u2018em up , put \u2018em down . one foot in front of the other . again and again . i like this little mantra . first , it\u2019s instructional \u2014 one foot in front of the other , repeat . second , it\u2019s easy \u2014 i can put one foot in front of the other with no thought , and hey , am i actually tired , or am i just a little bored and want to quit ? third , it\u2019s a reminder that i\u2019m in control . the commitments we make to ourselves are often the ones we\u2019re the quickest to break . the new diet , waking up early , reading more books , all are rapidly discarded at the slightest hurdle \u2014 real or perceived . i\u2019m guilty of this . i have broken many a promise to myself . sometimes i wonder where i\u2019d be today if i\u2019d stuck with them , which can be demoralising or motivation to stick with what i\u2019m doing now . how running is changing that i\u2019m in the early stages of training for my first marathon . this is an interesting time for me because , on the one hand , i\u2019ve got no choice but to train . on the other hand , it\u2019s almost 10 months away , so the pressure to execute the plan perfectly isn\u2019t really there . i\u2019m operating on the basis that the earlier i start , the better off i\u2019ll be . so , i do have a plan , and i\u2019m following it . on my last run , as i was in my third and final mile for that day , i had a sudden realisation . running wasn\u2019t just giving me physical health benefits , it was teaching me who i am , too . 1 . i like to quit . motivation porn , self-help books , inspirational stories , all of these are around us 24/7 and as we consume them , it\u2019s easy for us to believe that we , too , have what it takes to succeed . that like the author or speaker delivering their story of courage , we would also rise up to a challenge , or in the face of adversity , becoming who we are destined to be . alas , no . in my case , when my legs start to ache , i slow down . maybe i\u2019ll walk . is that the start of a stitch in my side ? better take it easy . ugh , another half mile ? i\u2019ll just take a breather now . but those motivational books and videos can be helpful . i draw on some of the more powerful lessons and say to myself , \u201ceach of these moments is an opportunity for me to improve or stagnate . if i push on , i grow . \u201d so , with the ache growing in my quads , i keep going . pick \u2018em up , put \u2018em down . 2 . i have more to give . in his autobiography can\u2019t hurt me , david goggins talks about the governor . he explains that this is our brain\u2019s way of keeping us comfortable , and it does it by telling us we\u2019re maxed out , to stop , in order to avoid injury . but , he says , the governor raises its head when we\u2019re only at 40% of our capacity \u2014 or in other words , when we think we\u2019ve done all we can , we haven\u2019t even dug half of our well . this instantly became one of the most profound lessons for me . it seared itself into my brain , and i recall it almost every time i\u2019m exercising . i was in the gym the very next day after reading it , performing an uncomfortable exercise called a banded hip ladder . you take a resistance band , step on it and pull the other end up to your chin . then you take 10 large steps to the right , and 10 large steps to the left . then 9 , 8 , 7 , all the way down to 1 . there is no rest until you\u2019ve finished that final 1 . my governor used to start complaining when i was on 8 , so i\u2019d rest , pause , and shake out my legs . following goggins\u2019 advice , i simply told myself , \u201cthis is my governor . i have plenty left . \u201d and what do you know ? i plowed right through that ladder , going from 10 to 1 straight through with no breaks . i now do the same thing on my runs . 3 . the blocks are mental . i\u2019m aware that boredom plays a huge part in my desire to give up . for example , sometimes if i\u2019m running a loop that requires me to do the same street twice , i\u2019ll think , \u201coh no , i can\u2019t do that road again . \u201d or everything will feel like a huge effort . \u201ci\u2019ve still got a mile and a half left ? \u201d \u201ci\u2019m only halfway ? ! to hell with this . \u201d again , i have a choice in these moments stagnate , or grow . running makes this decision very stark because it\u2019s literally in the moment . of course , we\u2019d all choose to grow over time . to read more books in a year . to move the needle a little bit . but in the actual moment , right now , keep going or give up , do you truly want to get better or do you want to wimp out ? given that our only real competition is ourselves , this question fires me up . i will not give up and lose to myself . i\u2019ll keep going , thank you very much . and as the legs keep moving like determined pistons , i realise that i could do this extra distance all along \u2014 my mind was just telling me otherwise . 4 . growth is addictive . except for injury , nobody gets home from a run wishing they hadn\u2019t done it , feeling worse than before , or like they wasted their time . on the contrary , we feel great and accomplished . and for me , as my lungs feel cleansed and my legs feel thoroughly used , i check my stats . a little further than last time , or a little quicker , or a simple reflection on how fun it was . and then ? well , i start looking forward to the next run , of course . pick \u2018em up , put \u2018em down . repeat .","completion": " Photo by Andrea Leopard on Unsplash. \n\nThe quote \"pick 'em up, put 'em down\" is a recurrent line in the book \"The Long Walk\" by Stephen King, writing under the pseudonym Richard Bach man. Set in a society akin to \"The Hunger Games,\" the novel depicts a world where teenage boys participate in a grueling competition known as the long walk. While I acknowledge that my own runs cannot compare to this intense challenge, I find inspiration in this mantra as I continue running. One foot in front of the other, repeatedly. \n\nThis simple phrase holds multiple meanings for me. Firstly, it provides clear instruction: one foot in front of the other, repeat. It serves as a reminder to maintain a steady rhythm and focus on the task at hand. Secondly, it offers ease. Placing one foot in front of the other requires minimal thought, allowing me to gauge whether fatigue is genuine or simply a fleeting desire to quit due to boredom. Finally, and most importantly, it reminds me that I am in control. Often, we are quick to break promises we make to ourselves, whether it's starting a new diet, waking up early, or reading more books. I am no exception to this tendency. Consequently, I ponder where I might be today had I stuck with previous commitments. This realization can be both disheartening and motivating, encouraging me to persevere in my current pursuits. \n\nI find myself in the early stages of training for my first marathon. This presents an interesting challenge. On one hand, I am obligated to train. On the other, the event is nearly ten months away, alleviating some pressure to execute the training plan flawlessly. Nonetheless, I have devised a plan and am diligently following it. During my recent run, as I completed my third and final mile for the day, I had an epiphany. Running not only benefits my physical well-being but also provides lessons about self-discovery. \n\nFirst, I have come to realize that I have a propensity to quit. In a world inundated with motivational content, self-help books, and inspirational stories, it is easy to fall into the belief that we possess the same unwavering determination as those who have overcome great challenges. However, when my legs begin to ache, I instinctively slow down or consider taking a break. Yet, I acknowledge the value of motivational literature and videos. I draw upon the powerful lessons they impart and remind myself that each moment is an opportunity for growth. With the ache in my quads steadily increasing, I persist. Pick 'em up, put 'em down. \n\nSecond, I have discovered that I am capable of more than I initially believe. Drawing from David Noggins' autobiography, \"Can't Hurt Me,\" I have learned about the concept of the \"governor.\" Noggins explains that our brains have a tendency to keep us in our comfort zones, falsely suggesting that we have reached our limits and urging us to stop to avoid injury. However, Noggins contends that when we believe we are at our maximum capacity, we have only tapped into 40% of our potential. This revelation resonated deeply with me and has influenced my approach to exercise. The following day, as I embarked on a challenging gym exercise known as a banded hip ladder, I refused to succumb to my internal governor's plea for rest. I recognized that I possessed untapped reserves of strength and successfully completed the exercise without pausing. I now employ the same resilience during my runs. \n\nNext, I confront the mental blocks that contribute to my desire to quit. Boredom plays a significant role in these moments. For instance, when faced with running the same route twice, I often feel a sense of resistance. Thoughts such as \"I can't do that road again\" or \"I still have a mile and a half left?\" arise, tempting me to give up. Running forces me to confront this decision in real-time. While, in the long run, we all aspire to grow, the choice to persist or falter presents itself acutely in the present moment. When faced with this question, fueled by the knowledge that my ultimate competitor is my past self, I am motivated to keep going. I refuse to surrender and lose to myself. Thank you, but I will continue. As my legs move with unwavering determination, I realize that I possessed the ability to cover the additional distance all along; my mind was merely attempting to convince me otherwise. \n\nLastly, I find that growth is addicting. Except injuries, no one returns from a run regretting their decision, feeling worse than before, or believing they wasted their time. Quite the opposite, we feel invigorated and accomplished. Personally, as my lungs feel refreshed, and my legs feel thoroughly utilized, I take note of my progress. Whether I have gone a little further, increased my pace, or merely enjoyed the experience, I find myself eagerly anticipating the next run. Pick 'em up, put 'em down, repeat. END"}

I find it to be a beneficial practice as it helps me avoid the temptation to edit while I write. Writing and editing are most effective when approached separately. During my time taking art classes in college, our professor would commence each session by conducting two 5-minute drawing exercises. The first exercise involved creating continuous contour line drawings for five minutes, while the second exercise focused on blind continuous contour line drawings. Continuous contour line drawing entails outlining the outer edges, or contour, of an object without lifting the pencil. Blind continuous contour line drawing follows the same method, but without the ability to look at the page. Our professor emphasized the importance of warming up before starting a drawing and keeping the hand in motion. This principle also applies to writing exercises. The objective remains the same: keep the hand moving. Another valuable lesson I learned in drawing class was to sketch without erasing, saving the erasing process for when the sketch is complete. Similarly, these writing exercises aim to teach you to draft your story without the temptation to constantly edit. The editing process can be reserved for when the initial draft is finished. In Lesson 1, we covered the concepts of lizard brain and monkey mind. Now, in Lesson 2, we are temporarily disregarding the monkey mind and allowing the lizard brain to take control. In this lesson, I challenge you to experiment with writing in the dark. It is also acceptable to write in dim lighting, as long as the words on the page are not easily visible. You should be able to see the lines on your paper, but the writing itself should be challenging to read. The tools necessary for this exercise remain the same as in Lesson 1: a notebook, an ink pen, a timer, and a blindfold or a dark room if you have the discipline to create one (unfortunately, I do not possess such discipline). If you can keep your eyes closed without a visual distraction, a blindfold may be unnecessary. However, I often find that my eyes naturally creep open, so I prefer to work in a darkened room or utilize a blindfold. It is crucial to remember that this exercise primarily focuses on writing without engaging in constant editing. The content of what you write is less significant than how you write it. There may even be portions of your writing that you are unable to read. I often find myself covering words with other words, and when I reach the end of a line, starting a new line beneath the previous one becomes a challenge in the absence of sight. The end result often appears as an illegible mess. Similarly, the line drawings and blind line drawings in art class bore little resemblance to the subject being drawn. However, the purpose of uninterrupted contour drawing is not to capture a perfect image, but rather to emphasize the process itself. This exercise emphasizes the importance of keeping your hand in motion. When you cannot see what you have written, you must resist the urge to go back and erase, cross out, or make any changes. Over time, you will become accustomed to writing without simultaneously editing (although I do not recommend developing a habit of writing in the dark!). Blind writing serves as a means of practice, as practice leads to improvement. While I do not believe any artist truly achieves perfection, every successful artist continues to learn, grow, and refine their craft. I suggest engaging in three 5-minute blind writing exercises before embarking on your main writing project. As with Lesson 1, take breaks between the 5-minute sessions and engage in activities that promote circulation, such as clapping your hands, jumping up and down, or singing. After taking three deep breaths, open your eyes, set your timer, and commence writing. If you find it challenging to begin, you can start with a repeating phrase such as \"in the dark\" or \"I am in the dark.\" Write this phrase repeatedly without looking until a new thought emerges. This is what my blind writing exercise resembled this morning (although some parts were difficult to decipher): \"I am in the dark. I am writing in the dark. My nose itches. This blindfold feels strange. I used to believe I could flatten myself completely under the covers. I would hide from my mother and become upset when she found me. Furthermore, I thought she must be a witch. In the dark, in the dark, my mind wanders in the dark. Tell me what you don't know. What don't I know? It is too dark.\" As you can see from the example provided, when I encountered a writing roadblock, I simply returned to the phrase \"in the dark.\" What is not apparent are the lines I wrote overlapping each other. Somehow, the content ended up pertaining to games of hide and seek, a closet, and the Bloody Mary myth. Engage in blind writing two or three times, and then proceed with an \"I am\" exercise. Keep in mind that these exercises serve as warm-ups. Although focusing on these 5-minute exercises can be enjoyable, you ultimately have a writing project to complete. I urge you to refrain from discarding your exercises, as they will prove useful in future exercises. If writing in the dark evokes discomfort or painful emotions, please do not force yourself to continue. Take a break and allow yourself the necessary time to process. This is your own creative journey, and together, let's make it an exceptional one. Before you initiate the exercise, I would like to remind you that I am interested in hearing how you are progressing with the writing exercises and warm-up lessons. Feel free to leave a response here once you have completed them. Are you prepared? Close your eyes, take three deep and slow breaths, open your eyes, set your timer, blindfold yourself or switch off the light, and... go! Write for five minutes, then get up and engage in some physical activity. Repeat this process. END"}
{"prompt": "flutter vs react native vs native deep performance comparison let\u2019s compare fps , cpu , memory , and gpu performance of popular mobile development tools on everyday life tasks . the story behind the research inverita and its mobile development team continuously dig into the performance of cross-platform mobile solutions available on the market to answer the question which technology is best flutter or react native ( or native ) for your product , maybe even career , that\u2019s how flutter vs react native vs native part i emerged . yes , it was quite controversial as one can state we weren\u2019t using react native to perform multiple calculations daily \u2014 that might be the case \u2014 but in this case , cpu heavy tasks are better performed by flutter or native apps . that\u2019s why in this article we decided to research the performance of ui which has a much bigger impact on a daily user of mobile apps . measuring ui performance is complex and it requires an engineer to implement the same functionality in the same way across every platform . we went with a gamebench as a global testing tool to leave no doubts and make sure we stay objective ( it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we truly love flutter in most aspects ) and still run lots of react native and native projects ) . gamebench has a lot of space for improvements , but we managed to put every app into a single testing environment with its help which was our goal . source code is open so please experiment and share your thoughts with us if you wish . ui animations mostly use different tools across different platforms so we narrowed everything to libraries supported by every platform ( but one case ) or at least we did everything we could to accomplish that . test results can be different and depend on your approaches to the implementation , we believe that you , as a potentially true expert of specific technology can push your specific set of tools to the limits where it outperforms our numbers and we are happy if you do . now , let\u2019s have a look at the cases . hardware info for our testing purposes , we were using an affordable xiaomi redmi note 5 and iphone 6s . repo link source code use case 1 \u2014 list view benchmarking we implemented the same ui on android and ios with the use of native , react native , and flutter . we also automated scroll velocity with the use of recyclerview . smoothscroller on android . on ios and react native we used an approach with timer and programmatically scrolling to position . on flutter , we used scrollcontroller to smoothly scroll over the list . in each case , we had 1000 items in the list view and the same scrolling time to reach the last list element . in each of these cases , we used image caching with different libs per platform . more details could be revealed in the source code . third-party libraries used in this case ios loading and caching images \u2014 nuke android loading and caching images \u2014 glide react native loading and caching images \u2014 react-native-fast-image android \u2014 gpu tests results are not supported by the benchmark ( unfortunately , with the devices we have , and we have many ) ) ) test results all tests have shown approximately the same fps . android native uses half as much memory compared to flutter and react native . react native requires the most significant cpu exploitation . the reason is the use of jsbridge between js and native code that incites the waste of resources on serialization and deserialization . regarding battery exploitation , android native has the best outcome . react-native is lagging behind both android and flutter . running continuous animations consume more battery power on react native . iphone 6s test test results fps . react native results are worse than those of flutter and swift . the reason is the inability to use iot compilation on ios . memory . flutter almost matches native in memory consumption but is still heavier on cpu . react native falls far behind flutter and native in this test . difference between flutter and swift . flutter is actively using cpu when ios native is actively using gpu . reconciliation in flutter increases the load on the cpu . use case 2 \u2014 heavy animations test nowadays most phones running on android and ios have powerful hardware . in most cases using usual business apps , no fps drops could be noticed . that\u2019s why we decided to do some tests with heavy animations . heavy enough to get fps drops . we used vector animations animated with lottie on android , ios , react native and adopted the same animations to use with flare on flutter . testing animation with lottie for android , ios , react native , and flare for flutter . lottie for android test results test results android android and react native have similarities in their performance . it\u2019s obvious because lottie for react native uses native means ( 16\u201319% cpu , 30\u201329 fps ) . flutter\u2019s outcome is such a surprise , though it screwed up a bit during a performance . ( 12% cpu and 9 fps ) . we discovered that removing one specific animation from the grid increases fps up to 40% on flutter . we suppose flare is heavier and not optimized for this kind of task that\u2019s why flutter got such an fps drop . blame this one lottie for android 3 . android requires the least amount of memory ( 205 mb ) react native needs 280 mb and flutter requires 266 mb . 4 . cold app start . according to this indicator , flutter is the leader ( 2 seconds ) . for android native and react native , it takes around 4 seconds . ios ios and react native outcomes on this test are almost the same as lottie for react native uses native means . flare and flutter are not going to stop surprising . flare definitely has a way to go d ios native requires the least amount of memory ( 48 mb ) . react native needs 135 mb and flutter requires 117 mb cold app start . according to this indicator , flutter is the leader ( 2 seconds ) . for ios and react native it takes around 10 seconds take note we used a different library for this case with flutter which is much heavier compared to those we used for other platforms and it might be the reason for fps drops . use case 3 \u2014 even heavier animations test with rotations , scaling and fade . in this test , we compared performance while animating 200 images . scale rotating and fade animations are executed at the same time . 200 images test results android native showed top performance and most efficient memory consumption . flutter showed just enough performance to work comfortably but twice more memory expenses comparing to native . react native \u2014showed a low performance on this case . test results ios iphone 6s is powerful enough to not drop fps in all 3 cases . native used fewer resources and gpu was used mostly . react native used mostly cpu for rendering while flutter used gpu . react native used a bit more memory . summary for usual business apps with minor animations and shiny looks , technology does not matter at all . but if you\u2019ll do some heavy animations keep in mind that native has the most performance power to do it . next , come flutter and react native . we would definitely not recommend using react native in a very cpu heavy operation , while flutter is a great fit for such tasks from both cpu and memory standpoint . the tool you pick depends on your specific product and business case . in case you are looking to develop a single-platform mvp \u2014 use native means , but keep in mind that flutter apps can be built both for mobile , web and desktop environments and it feels like flutter might become a king of cross-platform development in not too distant future , as even today flutter created a very decent competition for native development tools , especially if your development budget is not too stretched but you are still looking for the decent performance of yours app across different platforms . we face the fact that there might be many factors impacting implementation and benchmarks of each technology , and many of you who might be true experts of a specific platform can squeeze much more out of the beloved set of tools . we tried to bring as much transparency into the process as we could by creating a single environment for each app to get tested and a single set of tools to measure the performance , and i hope you liked the result . yet again our mobile and flutter teams are happy to receive and carry all the burden of your feedback and suggestions . you can also check out this article here .","completion": " Flutter vs React Native vs Native: A Deep Performance Comparison\n\nInherit and its mobile development team have conducted extensive research to compare the performance of popular mobile development tools - Flutter, React Native, and Native. The objective was to determine which technology is best suited for your product or even your career. While some might argue that we weren't using React Native for daily calculations, it is important to note that CPU-intensive tasks are better performed by Flutter or Native apps. Therefore, we focused our research on UI performance, which has a significant impact on everyday users of mobile apps.\n\nMeasuring UI performance is a complex process that requires consistent implementation across every platform. To ensure objectivity, we used Backbench as a global testing tool. Although we are huge fans of Flutter, we made sure to conduct tests on React Native and Native projects as well. While Backbench has room for improvement, it allowed us to test each app in a single environment, aligning with our goal. The source code is open for experimentation, and we welcome your thoughts and feedback.\n\nTo ensure fairness, we narrowed our focus to libraries supported by each platform (with one exception) for UI animations. It's important to note that test results can vary depending on implementation approaches. We believe that experts of each specific technology can push their tools to outperform our numbers. We encourage such exploration.\n\nLet's dive into the cases we studied. For testing purposes, we used an affordable Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and an iPhone 6s.\n\nUse case 1: List View Benchmarking\nWe implemented the same UI on Android and iOS using Native, React Native, and Flutter. We automated scroll velocity with RecyclerView. SmoothScroller on Android and used timers and programmatically scrolling to position on iOS and React Native. Flutter utilized ScrollController for smooth scrolling. In each case, the list view contained 1000 items, and the scrolling time to reach the last element was the same. Image caching with different libraries per platform was implemented, and further details can be found in the source code.\n\nThird-party libraries used in this case:\n- iOS: Loading and caching images - Nuke\n- Android: Loading and caching images - Glide\n- React Native: Loading and caching images - react-native-fast-image\n\nTest results:\nAll tests showed approximately the same frames per second (fps). Native Android apps used half as much memory compared to Flutter and React Native. React Native had the highest CPU usage due to the use of JSB ridge, which caused resource waste on serialization and serialization. In terms of battery usage, Native Android performed the best, while React Native lagged behind both Android and Flutter. Continuous animations consumed more battery power on React Native.\nFor iPhone 6s, the results demonstrated that React Native performed worse than Flutter and Swift due to the inability to use IOT compilation on iOS. Flutter's CPU usage was relatively high compared to Native iOS, where the latter actively used the GPU. Reconciliation in Flutter increased CPU load.\n\nUse case 2: Heavy Animations Test\nGiven the powerful hardware of most Android and iOS phones, usual business apps rarely experience FPS drops. To challenge the performance capabilities, we tested heavy animations using vector animations with Lottie on Android, iOS, React Native, and Flare on Flutter. The results are as follows:\n\nTest results for Lottie on Android:\n- Android Native and React Native showed similar performance, as Lottie for React Native uses native means\n- Flutter's outcome was surprising, although it had slight hiccups in performance\n- Removing a specific animation from the grid improved Flutter's fps by up to 40%\n- Android Native required the least amount of memory (205 MB), while React Native needed 280 MB and Flutter required 266 MB\n- In terms of cold app start, Flutter performed the best with 2 seconds, while Android Native and React Native took around 4 seconds\n\nTest results for Lottie on iOS:\n- iOS Native and React Native showed similar performance, as Lottie for React Native uses native means\n- Flutter and Flare continued to surprise; Flare seemed heavier and not optimized for this test, resulting in a fps drop for Flutter\n- iOS Native required the least memory (48 MB), while React Native needed 135 MB and Flutter required 117 MB\n- In terms of cold app start, Flutter performed the best with 2 seconds, while iOS Native and React Native took around 10 seconds\n\nWe should note that we used a different library for Flutter in this case, which was heavier compared to the ones used for other platforms. This might have been the reason for the fps drops.\n\nUse case 3: Even Heavier Animations Test\nIn this test, we compared the performance while animating 200 images with rotating, scaling, and fade animations executed simultaneously.\n\nTest results on Android:\n- Native Android showed top performance and the most efficient memory consumption\n- Flutter provided sufficient performance but had twice the memory consumption compared to Native\n- React Native showed poor performance\n\nTest results on iOS:\n- iPhone 6s exhibited no FPS drops in all three cases due to its powerful hardware\n- Native iOS used fewer resources and relied on GPU usage\n- React Native mainly used CPU for rendering, while Flutter relied on GPU\n- React Native used slightly more memory\n\nSummary:\nFor usual business apps with minor animations, the choice of technology may not matter significantly. However, for heavier animations, Native offers the most performance power. Flutter and React Native are suitable options but with some considerations. We don't recommend using React Native for CPU-intensive operations, while Flutter excels in tasks that require both CPU and memory optimization.\n\nThe choice of tool should align with your specific product and business case. If you are developing a single-platform MVP, Native development is recommended. However, keep in mind that Flutter apps can be built for mobile, web, and desktop environments, making it a compelling option for cross-platform development. Flutter has already emerged as a strong contender against Native development tools, especially if your development budget allows for it, and you seek excellent performance across different platforms.\n\nWe acknowledge that various factors can impact implementation and benchmarks for each technology. We believe that true experts of a specific platform can extract even better performance from their tools. Furthermore, we strive to provide transparency by creating a single environment for each app to be tested and using a consistent set of tools to measure performance. Our mobile and Flutter teams eagerly await your feedback and suggestions.\n\nYou can also find this article [here](source-code-link). END"}

Comparing the similarity measurement between two vectors represented in a higher-dimensional space has proven to be highly useful. Let's explore a few scenarios and applications where cosine similarity is leveraged.\n\n1. Document Similarity:\n\nIdentifying the similarity between pairs of documents is an ideal use case for cosine similarity. By converting the words or phrases within a document or sentence into a vectorized representation, we can obtain a quantification of similarity. The vector representations of the documents can then be plugged into the cosine similarity formula. In this scenario, a cosine similarity of 1 signifies that the two documents are exactly alike, while a cosine similarity of 0 indicates no similarities between the documents.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nDocument 1: \"Deep learning can be hard\"\n\nDocument 2: \"Deep learning can be simple\"\n\nStep 1: Obtain vectorized representations of the texts:\n\nDocument 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nDocument 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nStep 2: Find the cosine similarity:\n\nCosine Similarity (CS) = (a. b) / (||a|| ||b||)\n\nCalculate the dot product between a and b: 1.1 + 1.1 + 1.1 + 1.1 + 1.0 + 0.1 = 4\n\nCalculate the magnitude of vector a: \u221a(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = 2.2360679775\n\nCalculate the magnitude of vector b: \u221a(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = 2.2360679775\n\nCalculate the cosine similarity: (4) / (2.2360679775 * 2.2360679775) = 0.80 (80% similarity between the sentences in both documents)\n\n2. Pose Matching:\n\nPose matching involves comparing poses that contain key points of joint locations. Pose estimation, a computer vision task, is typically solved using deep learning approaches such as convolutional pose machine, stacked hourglass, and pose net. Pose estimation involves deriving the position and orientation of vital body parts and joints from an image or sequence of images.\n\nIn a scenario where quantifying the similarity between two poses in image A and image B is required, the following process would be taken.

The rapid advancement of emerging technologies has further reshaped labor markets, with these trends accelerating during the onset of the current recession. As a result, millions of workers worldwide now face significant job uncertainty.\n\nData from the International Labor Organization (ILL) reveals that real unemployment figures soared to an average of 6.6% in the first half of 2020, with an estimated loss of working hours equivalent to 495 million jobs in Q2 2020. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicts that unemployment rates could double by the end of the year.\n\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2020, now in its third edition, provides insights into the future of work by tracking the pace and direction of change in jobs and skills. Key findings from the report include:\n\n1. Lasting Effects of COVID-19: The pandemic has accelerated the arrival of the future of work. The report indicates that 50% of employers will expedite the automation of work, and over 80% plan to expand the digitization of work processes. Consequently, certain jobs that have been lost may never return, and those that do will require new ways of working and new skills.\n\n2. Continued Automation: The Future of Jobs Report projects that by 2025, the hours of work performed by machines and humans will be equal. Approximately 85 million roles, especially manual or repetitive positions across blue-collar and white-collar jobs, are expected to be displaced by automation. This includes roles such as assembly factory workers and accountants.\n\n3. Emergence of New Jobs: Despite the disruptive impact on jobs, the report also predicts the creation of 97 million new jobs by 2025. The most in-demand roles in future job markets include data analysts and scientists, AI and machine learning specialists, robotics engineers, software and application developers, digital transformation specialists, information security analysts, and internet of things specialists. These roles are categorized in the report's exploration of 10 emerging job clusters.\n\n4. In-Demand Skills: The most sought-after skills for the future encompass both hard and soft skills. In addition to proficiency in working with people and problem-solving, self-management skills such as resilience, stress tolerance, and flexibility are essential. As workers face the pressures of adapting to more digital ways of working, specialized skills in product management, digital marketing, and software development lifecycle are also critical. Deskilling for future roles will require time investments ranging from three weeks to five months.\n\n5. Increasing Importance of Human Capital: Employers recognize the value of building human capital, with 66% believing that training employees will yield a return on investment within a year. Data from the past five years demonstrates that workers often do not need a perfect skill set to transition into new roles. However, addressing the challenge at scale is significant, as employers aim to redeploy half of their workforce internally. Furthermore, around 40% of an average worker's skills will need updating to meet the demands of future labor markets. Unfortunately, only 21% of employers can access government funding for training programs.\n\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2020 serves as a call to action, urging an acceleration of the deskilling revolution across economies. It underscores the growing urgency for supporting displaced and at-risk workers as they navigate the path toward the jobs of tomorrow. This moment presents an opportunity for leaders in business, government, and public policy to unite efforts and enable workers to thrive in the new economy. END"}

It's quite nostalgic to look back on those days when we didn't have access to augmented or virtual reality. Communication was much simpler back then, with a quick exchange of approximate location and time, and we were ready for some fun. One of the highlights of my childhood was playing on the Sega Master System II.\n\nIn the past, gaming consoles looked quite different from what we have today. Games came in cartridges that you had to insert into the console. However, not all games required this, as some came pre-installed. One game that captured many hours of my life was \"Alex Kidd in Miracle World,\" a true masterpiece. In this game, you played as the protagonist, Alex, on a mission to defeat an illegitimate tyrant. The gameplay was diverse and captivating, with activities like jumping around, breaking bricks, collecting money, and navigating underwater while avoiding fish and octopus tentacles. It was truly an immersive experience.\n\nOne unique aspect of \"Alex Kidd in Miracle World\" was the inclusion of a game of rock-paper-scissors at the end of each level. I have yet to play more intense games of rock-paper-scissors anywhere else. It's fascinating to see how gaming has evolved over the years. Nowadays, children are playing in virtual worlds without the need for cables or physical consoles.\n\nTo bridge the gap between the past and present, I created a program that utilizes computer vision and deep learning to play a game of rock-paper-scissors in real-time using a webcam. This may sound impressive, but it's actually a straightforward process.\n\nTo develop this program, I used the OpenCV library in Python, which provides comprehensive computer vision functionalities. Plenty of online tutorials are available to help you get started with OpenCV. Additionally, I utilized TensorFlow and Keras for the deep learning aspects of the project.\n\nTo play the game, all you need is a hand. The program recognizes the gesture made by the hand, compares it against the opponent's gesture, and determines whether it's a win, loss, or draw. The process involves identifying the hand within a specific region of interest on the video stream. Instead of implementing a complex hand tracking algorithm, I opted for simplicity by creating a fixed region where the user can place their hand and perform the gesture.\n\nOnce we isolate the hand, we can focus on recognizing the gestures. Deep learning comes into play here, as I found it cool and effortless to leverage this technology for the task. To train the model, I utilized a few hundred images of each hand gesture, augmented the dataset, and trained the model in just under six minutes. Data augmentation involves randomly modifying the images, such as rotating them at various angles or zooming in and out. This technique helps create a more diverse training set and enhances the model's performance.\n\nOnce the program recognizes the gesture, it applies the rules of rock-paper-scissors (paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beat paper) to determine the outcome. Since I didn't have anyone to play against, I simulated an opponent within the program.\n\nOverall, the program offers a fun and engaging experience. However, there's always room for improvement. If I had more time to invest in further enhancing the project, I would explore options like implementing a hand tracking system to eliminate the need for a preset region of interest. Additionally, I'd work on refining the deep learning model by expanding the training data to include more hand gestures. The opponent could also be improved, either by creating a reinforcement learning agent or by developing additional logic that adds an element of strategy and unpredictability to the game. On the visual side, I would enhance the graphics and effects of the play screen, incorporating elements like a countdown for each new game and celebratory visuals for winning.\n\nIf you find this project intriguing, feel free to explore other ideas and have some fun with it. I'm sure there's more room for creativity and personalization. Congratulations on making it through the entire article, defeating the bosses of boredom, not-fun experiences, and obviousness. As a reward, you can find the code for this project on my GitHub page. If you have any questions along the way, don't hesitate to reach out, although the code is relatively simple, so you should have no trouble.

the explanation is nerd heaven , and i\u2019ll give it to you , along with a few other improvements , in the optional-to-read bottom section of this essay . more on mixing up the washing solution the neilmed video talks about using distilled water ( cleaner than tap water ) , and putting neilmed\u2019s powdered salt preparation into the bottle . your body\u2019s fluids are salty the inside of your nose likes it better if your washing solution is salty . here\u2019s what i do get a gallon of distilled water and put in eight teaspoons of table salt . make sure it mixes completely . use that water for your nasal rinses . if you want to do it one rinse bottle at a time , it\u2019s one-half teaspoon of salt in the rinse bottle . neilmed suggests heating the water a bit . room temperature is about 72 and your body is about 98 . i\u2019ve tried heating and not , and i don\u2019t notice much difference . don\u2019t make the water hot and hurt yourself ! the clinical trial suggests one-half teaspoon of johnson\u2019s baby shampoo for each bottle . that works out to about two pumps of a typical 27-ounce baby shampoo pump dispenser . you can measure it for yourself . after you pump in the shampoo , put your thumb on the top of the bottle and swirl it around to mix the shampoo in . get the water swirling like a little tornado . don\u2019t shake it you\u2019ll just foam things up . if you swirl for only a couple of seconds , and then hold the bottle up to a light , you\u2019ll see strings of shampoo still swirling and dissolving . you have to swirl for about thirty seconds to get the shampoo to dissolve all the way . ( interestingly , if you heat the water to ninety degrees , the shampoo dissolves in about five seconds . ) at first , i found the baby shampoo a touch irritating . so for a week or so i only used one-quarter teaspoon of shampoo \u2014 one pump \u2014 instead of the recommended one-half teaspoon . now it doesn\u2019t bother at all . more on doing the rinse you can lean over the sink to wash and not spill a drop , even on your first try . but if you do it with your head tilted back ten degrees , all of the water will run down your shirt . you can do it in the shower , or fold a thick bath towel and push it under your chin and in front of your neck to catch the drain-off . don\u2019t squeeze the bottle hard . you don\u2019t need a high flow rate . just squeeze slowly , and let the chore take longer . that way , you\u2019ll spend more time with the soap solution bathing your tissues .","completion": " Proper hand hygiene is widely acknowledged as an effective measure in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. However, it is worth exploring whether washing the nose, where the virus resides, can also provide additional protection. This article aims to delve into this idea, explain the technique, and provide some scientific insights on the matter.\n\nAs a head and neck surgeon with a degree in physics, I possess above-average knowledge in these topics. Furthermore, I incorporate the techniques described below into my daily routine. Therefore, I can provide credible information on this subject.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend handwashing with plain soap and water as a reliable method of safeguarding oneself from the coronavirus. Soap is effective because it breaks down the lipid layer, or the shell, of the virus, leading to its prompt destruction. Considering that the virus primarily enters the body through the nose, where it replicates and resides, it begs the question: why not wash that part of the body with soap as well?\n\nMany individuals experiencing sinusitis find relief through nasal rinses, which involve washing the internal nose with salt water. This therapeutic practice, although it may seem unusual, has been employed for thousands of years and is not uncomfortable, even for first-time users. A convenient nasal rinse bottle can be easily obtained at any drug store.\n\nThe concept of washing the inside of the nose with soap appeared so logical that researchers at Vanderbilt University initiated a clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health to explore whether nasal washing could benefit coronavirus patients. In this trial, the participants utilize Johnson's Baby Shampoo, precisely half a teaspoon, mixed in a plastic nasal rinse bottle. The technique used is similar to the one demonstrated in the Named video.\n\nTo understand the mechanics of this technique, let us examine a diagram illustrating the internal structure of the nose. Water is poured into one nostril, filling the space behind the nasal cavities, known as the hypopharynx. This area is the site where the virus primarily settles and replicates upon infection. Eventually, the water level rises above the floor of the hypopharynx, causing it to flow out through the other nostril.\n\nTo ensure that the soapy water thoroughly reaches all parts of the hypopharynx, it is recommended to perform the nasal rinses with the head tilted upward at an angle of ten to fifteen degrees from a neutral standing position. This is akin to tilting the head slightly to look upward at something on the ceiling. The detailed explanation behind why tilting the head upward is advantageous, along with other improvements to the technique, can be found in the optional-to-read section below.\n\nRegarding the washing solution, it is preferable to use distilled water, as it is cleaner than tap water. Since your body's fluids possess a certain level of salinity, your nasal tissues respond better to a saline-based solution. For this purpose, dissolve eight teaspoons of table salt in a gallon of distilled water. Alternatively, you can mix half a teaspoon of salt in each rinse bottle. Named recommends slightly heating the water, but there is no significant difference whether the water is warm or at room temperature. Caution must be exercised not to make the water too hot, as it may cause harm.\n\nIn terms of the shampoo component, the clinical trial suggests using half a teaspoon of Johnson's Baby Shampoo per bottle. This roughly translates to two pumps from a typical 27-ounce baby shampoo dispenser. After adding the shampoo, gently swirl the bottle to ensure thorough mixing, without shaking it vigorously to avoid excessive foaming. Swirling for approximately thirty seconds will allow the shampoo to dissolve completely. Interestingly, if the water is heated to ninety degrees, the shampoo dissolves in about five seconds. Initially, some individuals may find the baby shampoo slightly irritating. In such cases, it is advisable to start using one-quarter teaspoon, or one pump, of the shampoo and gradually increase the amount until it no longer causes discomfort.\n\nDuring the rinsing process, it is possible to lean over the sink without spilling any liquid, even when attempting it for the first time. However, if performed with the head tilted back at a ten-degree angle, all the water may run down your shirt. Alternatively, it is feasible to carry out the rinses in the shower or place a folded thick bath towel under the chin and in front of the neck to catch any runoff. Squeezing the bottle gently will suffice, as there is no need for a high flow rate. It is recommended to squeeze the bottle slowly to allow the soap solution more time to bathe the nasal tissues effectively.\n\nBy expanding our hygiene practices to include nasal washing with soap, we can potentially enhance our defenses against the coronavirus. Though further research is necessary to establish its full effectiveness, it is a simple technique that may provide added protection in the fight against COVID-19. END"}

Throughout this journey, I have learned valuable lessons that I believe anyone can implement. In this article, I will share with you the six energy lessons that have made a significant impact on my life.\n\nFirst and foremost, I discovered the power of taking walks. During a period of frustration with life, I intuitively started going for daily walks. Although they didn't seem to have an immediate effect, I persisted. One night, I embarked on a walk that was intended to last 30 minutes but ended up extending late into the night. During these walks, I listened to self-help stories and used them as a means of escape and reflection. They provided me with new insights that ultimately saved my life. Inspired by Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's words, \"every day, I walk myself into a state of well-being & walk away from every illness,\" I discovered the power of walking as a way to restore energy and clarity.\n\nAnother integral part of my journey was experimenting with a whole food plant-based diet. I learned that the food we consume directly affects our energy levels. By embracing this diet, which emphasizes natural sugars like honey and dates instead of refined sugars, less salt, and no oils (including olive oil), I was able to recreate the vibrant energy I experienced as a child. Admittedly, transitioning to a new diet can be challenging, as your taste buds need time to adapt. However, with perseverance, I can now appreciate the sweetness of a mango or the natural flavor of carrots in a way that processed foods never provided.\n\nOne concern many people have when considering a whole food plant-based diet is the availability of options when dining out. However, I have found that most restaurants are accommodating and willing to meet dietary requirements if you simply ask. Chefs even appreciate the opportunity to be creative and deviate from their regular menu offerings. So, don't hesitate to request a dish that aligns with your dietary preferences \u2013 it may even lead to a delightful surprise.\n\nTo further improve my energy levels, I made a conscious decision to eat at home more often. Restaurants often rely on salt and sugar to enhance the taste of their food, which can negatively impact our health and energy. By cooking at home, I regained control over the ingredients I consumed and saved money in the process. It also provided me with a deeper appreciation for fueling my body for energy rather than solely for pleasure.\n\nAdditionally, I learned the importance of prioritizing sleep. As a chronic under-sleeper, I realized that getting adequate rest significantly impacts energy levels. I made a conscious effort to add an extra 30 minutes to my sleep routine and to prioritize rest over other activities. As a result, I experienced a significant improvement in my overall energy and vitality.\n\nLastly, I made the bold decision to give up alcohol entirely. Not only does alcohol dehydrate the body, but it also negatively affects mental well-being and saps precious energy. In fact, I discovered that marketing has misled us into believing that alcohol is a means of relaxation. The truth is, alcohol is poison and there are far healthier ways to find pleasure and relaxation. By replacing alcoholic beverages with water, I rehydrated my body and replenished my energy levels.\n\nIn my quest to conserve and enhance my energy, I also realized the importance of plugging everyday energy leaks. Focusing on uncontrollable factors such as anger, frustration, shame, and seeking revenge drains our energy and hinders our ability to live fully. Instead, I chose to forgive those who wronged me \u2013 an act that allowed me to regain mental clarity and peace of mind. I learned that it is simply not worth sacrificing our energy for trivial matters.\n\nIn conclusion, through my personal journey from a state of illness to one of vitality, I have discovered six energy lessons that have had a profound impact on my life. By incorporating daily walks, embracing a whole food plant-based diet, cooking and eating at home, consciously prioritizing sleep, eliminating alcohol, and plugging everyday energy leaks, I have reinvigorated my body and experienced a newfound sense of vibrancy and energy. I hope that these lessons can empower and inspire you to make positive changes in your own life. END"}
