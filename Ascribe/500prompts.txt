I am happy to welcome the first-ever State of Youth Report. Informed by nearly 1,000 young people of diverse backgrounds from across the country, this report recognizes the contributions of youth in Canada, and their potential to shape a better future for everyone. Youth in Canada are engaged, resourceful, and resilient. They are the leaders of tomorrow, and of today. They understand the biggest issues facing our country, and they have the ideas and solutions to address them. The report focuses on their largest priorities, including truth finding and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, the environment and climate action, health and wellness, leadership and impact, employment, and innovation, skills, and learning. It outlines their important viewpoints on these issues, and introduces their vision for building a better Canada that works for everyone. The past year has been challenging for everyone as we battled a global pandemic, and youth in Canada have been among those most impacted. They have made immense sacrifices to protect their parents and grandparents, and we must put them at the centre of our recovery as we build back better from this crisis. That is why the Government of Canada has made investments to support vulnerable youth, including those facing barriers to employment, as well as to make it easier for young people to pursue and complete their education, pay down student debt, and find training and work opportunities. Youth in Canada hold our future in their hands, so when we invest in them, we are investing in Canada’s success and long-term prosperity. I thank the hundreds of young people who contributed to the creation of this report, and all others involved in its preparation. As the previous Minister of Youth, I look forward to advancing this crucial work, both through my Youth Council and the continued implementation of Canada’s first-ever youth policy. The government will continue to listen to the voices of youth in Canada, collaborate with them, and take action to empower them to drive change in their communities and make their dreams a reality. Canada’s first-ever State of Youth Report is unique in so many ways, and is a reminder that youth across the country are bursting with new and innovative ways of addressing some of our country’s most complex issues. The recommendations contained in this report are a result of engagement sessions with approximately 1,000 young people, including First Nations, Métis, Inuit, Black and racialized, and LGBTQ2 youth, many of whom are facing barriers to meaningful participation in society. Through my work as Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with many of these youth and I’ve seen how committed they are to building a better country. Like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I believe in the power of youth - which is why it was so important to ensure that this report was developed “for youth, with youth, and by youth”. While it might be the first report of its kind, we know that it is a continuation of our government’s longstanding commitment to build a better future for youth in Canada. We must also remember that youth in Canada represent a diverse cross-section of society as individuals with unique circumstances based in part on where they live, their stage in life, and their background. These intersectional identities contribute to the rich diversity of our country, but sometimes also hinder youth from reaching their full potential. With this important context in mind, I invite you to read this report, reflect on the recommendations, and learn more about the state of young people in this country – including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. I truly believe that listening and hearing from our young leaders is the only way we will build a better future for all Canadians.

When Ewan Reid passionately describes that his software is going to the moon next year, it’s hard to imagine he almost became a banker. But an exciting opportunity at an aerospace company and landing a job as a shuttle flight controller at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in 2008 changed his course and set him on the path to working in the aerospace industry. Reid is the founder and CEO of Mission Control, an Ottawa-based space exploration and robotics company incorporated in 2015. From its humble beginnings to producing software destined for the moon, the company has reached new heights and will mark a significant milestone next year. Mission Control teamed up with the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to help a small rover navigate the moon’s terrain. Mission Control’s cutting-edge artificial intelligence software operates robots via the Internet. Back on earth, Mission Control’s software will send data almost in real time to scientists at 4 Canadian universities who will work with the Dubai space centre team to decide where the rover should go. This partnership with the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre allows Mission Control to demonstrate their technology for the first time in space. “This is the first Canadian software, the first Canadian computer, the first Canadian artificial intelligence to go to the moon,” said Reid. “I’m really proud of our team and honoured for us to be, in a way, representing Canada on the Emirates’ lunar mission.” There’s no doubt that Mission Control is ready for its first foray into space, which could open up many opportunities for the company. They’ve been practising with the little bit of “space” they brought to their office: a 4,000-square-foot room constructed to look like the surface of the moon, where they drive rovers using their software. Dubbed the “moonyard” by the company, it’s a testing facility with sand, rocks, craters, black walls and lights that simulate the sun where Mission Control and partners can practise before going on real moon explorations. Mission Control was proud to share their world-class facility and software in Dubai in 2021. Reid and several colleagues travelled to Expo 2020 Dubai and the International Astronautical Congress to share their work with a global audience. “It’s critical in the space industry to work with international space organizations. Almost no space missions can be completed by a single country,” said Reid. “Going to something like Expo is really important for us to build those relationships, those partnerships, and ultimately execute exciting and important space missions.” Canada’s Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) has helped Mission Control explore markets in Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. During a trade mission to the United Arab Emirates in 2019, Reid met with officials from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre for the first time. And in Japan, the TCS introduced Reid to ispace, a lunar exploration company that is crucial to the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre mission. An ispace lander will carry the space centre’s rover and Mission Control’s software to the moon. The TCS ensured Mission Control had a “soft landing” in international markets to forge new partnerships for this Ottawa start-up company and help it reach new heights.

August 1, 2023, marks the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Lester B. Pearson Building, a symbol of Canada’s involvement on the international scene. Located at 125 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, it serves as the headquarters of Global Affairs Canada, hosting approximately 3,300 employees. Let’s take a moment to celebrate the rich history and enduring legacy of this building! The Lester B. Pearson Building is situated on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg people. It occupies a prominent location on Sussex Drive along the ceremonial route from Parliament Hill to Rideau Hall, the governor general’s residence. Standing tall with its 4 office towers, the building marked a significant chapter in Canada’s architectural and governmental heritage. Designed by the firm Webb Zerafa Menkès Housden and built between 1970 and 1973, it was named in honour of Lester B. Pearson, the esteemed prime minister, diplomat and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. His visionary leadership had led to historic contributions to peacekeeping, such as the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force. “It is appropriate that Canada's first physical expression of its relations with the rest of the world be named for Mr. Pearson,” a government spokesman said to The New York Times in 1973. The architectural brilliance of the building showcases the Late Modern movement and has elements of Brutalism. Noel Adams, then-coordinator of requirements for the Department of External Affairs with the Department of Public Works, stated that the design aimed for a sense of repose, quiet dignity, precision and restraint. This vision was manifested through the implementation of strong horizontal lines, an organic form and the incorporation of dark materials. The building is a landmark and makes a lasting impression on all who visit the bustling neighbourhood nearby. Over the past 5 decades, this building has served as the epicentre of the department, which is today called Global Affairs Canada. Its halls have borne witness to historic events, state visits and significant diplomatic engagements, starting with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II officially opening the building on August 1, 1973. In her inaugural speech, Queen Elizabeth expressed her joy that the ceremony was taking place on the eve of her first Commonwealth heads of government meeting. The timing highlighted the significance of this moment for the Commonwealth nations. Canada’s foreign service officers and diplomatic leaders who work at the building have played a pivotal role in promoting and safeguarding Canada’s interests on the global stage. Throughout the past 50 years, the Lester B. Pearson Building has housed public servants who have championed causes such as human rights, gender equality and peacekeeping worldwide. The department has advanced Canada’s foreign policy objectives, showcased the nation’s values and provided a strong voice in international forums. As the world evolves, so too does this classified federal heritage building. In 2017, a large-scale rehabilitation project was announced. Renovation includes upgraded plumbing and electrical systems to enhance the building’s environmental performance and aims for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold certification. The interior spaces are being transformed to align with the new Government of Canada standard for offices, announced in 2022, which emphasizes collaboration and flexibility. As we celebrate the Lester B. Pearson Building’s 50 years, we pay tribute to its remarkable heritage. This iconic structure remains a steadfast embodiment of Canada’s commitment to diplomacy, collaboration and global engagement. Let’s draw inspiration from the values and principles it represents as we forge ahead to foster peace, prosperity and cooperation on the world stage.

Canada was one of the first countries in the world to put in place a feminist international assistance policy in 2017. But what does having a feminist approach to international assistance mean? Are we leaving men and boys behind to prioritize women? Absolutely not. The Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP) is feminist because it addresses the root causes of poverty through an intersectional, human rights-based and feminist lens, meaning it considers multiple and overlapping forms of discrimination. This enablesus to identify the groups and individuals in situations of extreme poverty, vulnerability and marginalization. The FIAP looks to level the playing field by addressing key barriers to equality. This is important because we cannot eliminate poverty without considering the needs of different groups of people. An estimated 55% of the global population faces instability and poverty. Entrenched gender inequalities affect women and girls more than men and boys, and in different ways. This is true both in Canada and around the world, particularly for women and groups pushed to the peripheries of society. To create a more peaceful and prosperous world for everyone, we need to tackle inequalities so that people — no matter their gender identity or expression, sex characteristics or other identity factors — can fully enjoy their human rights. The Feminist Policy’s goal is to reduce poverty around the world; interventions that advance gender equality are proven to make the most significant progress toward this goal. A United Nations study found that closing the gender gap on farms and in agrifood systems would increase global gross domestic product by nearly a trillion US dollars. This would reduce the number of food-insecure people by 45 million. That’s 1 of many statistics that illustrate current inequality. If half of small-scale producers benefited from development interventions that focused on empowering women, it would significantly raise the incomes of an additional 58 million people and increase the resilience of an additional 235 million people. This is why Canada funds projects like SeedChange, which ensured women made up 50% of the leadership positions in collective enterprises like farming co-ops and increased participation in traditionally male-dominated areas. SeedChange targeted the Central American Dry Corridor, Burkina Faso, Mali and Ethiopia, where it helped increase seed, food and economic security for 26,046 small-scale farm households. As a result of the project, households grew more fruits and vegetables, along with more diverse crops, making more food available to families living in poverty. The data collected over five years proved the project led tohealthier diets, better livelihoods, improved climate resilience, and greater autonomy in every community. More than 100 women’s groups and almost 40 youth-run co-ops broke down the barriers they faced to entering the marketplace. In Gaza, female-headed households are far more likely to live in poverty and experience pronounced inequality in a society where traditional gender roles dominate. Through the Canada-funded Salalem Leadership Institute, Sarah, a single parent of 2, joined an 8-week entrepreneurship training program and received support for her agricultural startup. “I was born and raised as a farmer,” says Sarah. “Since I was young, I have grown and tended to the plants. With the help of my mother and brothers, I succeeded to start my dream business that will provide my children a secured future.” Sarah received mentorship support through Salalem to improve fer farming practices and expand her business. Sarah has so far harvested crops for at least 6 consecutive farming seasons. After one year of successfully running her business she was able to rent a bigger piece of land to diversify and increase her farming productions. She also bought goats, which helped her to start up an animal breeding and productions line.

The commercial building you choose will have a big impact on your business. Ideally, its size, layout, location and appearance should all enhance your operations while respecting zoning and environmental regulations. Commercial buildings come in a wide variety of shapes, locations and prices, so you have to know what your needs are and how much you can afford to pay. If you've worked on a business plan, you probably know the amount you can spend on rent or a mortgage, utilities and taxes. A cash-flow analysis will help you determine whether you can afford to purchase a commercial property or if renting is your only viable option. Renting may allow you to keep more of your working capital for business operations. Still, don't forget to take future rent increases into account. When you own your property, you know what your monthly mortgage payments will be and you are building equity for your business. Be sure to weigh out your options when deciding to buy or lease you commercial space. In the meantime, here are five tips to help guide your thinking when searching for the right location for your business. 1. Adapt your selection to the needs of your business If you're a retailer, you probably want to make sure there's ample parking and pedestrian traffic as well as attractive decor. Situating your business close to a magnet or "anchor" store can provide you with lots of walk-by customers. If you sell high-end clothing, for example, it's probably best to avoid discount malls and instead locate your business close to other high-end retailers such as shoe stores or jewelers. Location and decor are less important to the success of a small wholesale or manufacturing operation, but you will have to comply with zoning regulations that stipulate what types of activity are allowed where. You should also consider the availability of qualified employees within a half-hour commute of where you are considering buying. For personal, professional or creative services, you may require a series of closed offices in pleasant surroundings with high-speed networking and easy access to public transit. The ability to attract and retain qualified employees can be critical to success of such businesses, so a building in a central, easily accessible location can give you a strategic advantage. When considering a loading dock, for instance, ask yourself: Is it well situated? Does it require repair? Are there more than one in the facility? 2. Does it require modification? If you've found a suitable building in a good location, consider what it will take to make it just right. The question then becomes, "Who will pay?" If you're renting premises that require modification, you'll have to negotiate with the owner. Make sure you have a contract specifying what needs to be done, with clear deadlines and penalties for not completing the work on time. These provisions need to be written into your lease. If you want to buy, use an accredited inspection company to evaluate the building for defects and the entire property for environmental contamination. Defects can be points for negotiation with the seller—or signs of future headaches best avoided altogether. Not all changes are within the power of an owner to complete. There may be zoning or heritage regulations that require renovations to be approved by a local board. Even a minor change, like inserting a shipping door into an old brick façade, can require municipal approval. This can take time, and there's no guarantee the changes requested will be allowed. 3. Consider local taxes and infrastructure Taxes vary between municipalities, with some towns offering preferential rates in the hopes of attracting businesses. Your commercial real estate agent should know what the taxes will be, as well as the infrastructure and utilities—including Internet access, garbage pickup, roads, electricity and natural gas—that are available at the sites you're considering.

National parks are among the world's natural jewels. They represent the power of Canada's natural environment which has shaped not only the geography of this country, but also the course of its history and the experiences of the people who live and travel here. National parks are established to protect and present outstanding representative examples of natural landscapes and phenomena that occur in each of Canada's unique natural regions, as identified in the National Parks System Plan. When establishing new parks, other considerations include the area’s ecological connectivity with other regions and whether the area is represented or underrepresented within the system plan. These wild places, located in every province and territory, range from mountains and plains, to boreal forests and tundra, to lakes and glaciers, and beyond. National parks protect the habitats, wildlife, and ecosystem diversity representative of these natural regions. National parks are located on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts, across the interior mountains, plains and Great Lakes. They range in size from 14 km2 (Georgian Bay Islands National Park of Canada) to almost 45,000 km2 (Wood Buffalo National Park of Canada). And they include world-renowned names such as Banff and Jasper, as well as more recently established Ivvavik and Vuntut. Parks Canada is responsible for both protecting the ecosystems of these magnificent natural areas and managing them for visitors to understand, appreciate, and enjoy in a way that doesn't compromise their integrity. Understanding and appreciating The breathtaking scenery and natural surroundings of national parks provide the perfect setting for tuning into nature, respecting it, and pledging to protect it. Each national park is a haven for the human spirit. National parks tell the stories of the natural beginnings of these lands--mountains forming, lakes emerging, rivers running, forests growing, glaciers moving, grasslands evolving. They reveal ongoing natural processes--floods, fires and the migration of species. They provide opportunities to connect with nature, people and the events that define the peoples of these lands. Visitors can paddle down rivers flowing through canyons carved over thousands of years, observe birds as they rest in their travels along traditional migration routes, walk through vibrant young forests transformed by fire. These are unforgettable experiences, made all the more memorable by the rich experiences Parks Canada offers. Protecting Parks Canada is working to maintain or restore the ecological integrity of national parks. This means keeping ecosystems healthy and whole—a state where ecosystem biodiversity, structures and functions are unimpaired and likely to persist. The national parks of Canada are a source of pride for Canadians and an integral part of our identity, they celebrate the beauty and infinite variety of this land. National Parks System Plan The National Parks System Plan identifies each of Canada's unique natural regions. The aim of the plan is to protect a representative sample of each of these landscapes. This framework has helped guide the expansion of the parks system for decades. To request a PDF copy of the National Park System Plan (1997), please contact us at: information@pc.gc.ca.

Can you imagine travelling across the 92km width of Lake Erie? This challenging task seems next to impossible for us. Yet somehow, tiny monarch butterflies manage to make the journey. They don’t just travel across the Great Lakes, but across entire countries to migrate. But the journey for this species at risk is getting harder and harder each year. In the fall, monarch butterflies escape the cold through migration. They travel from Southern Canada all the way down to Mexico to stay for the winter. In the spring, a new generation of butterflies travels thousands of kilometres from Mexico. They cross the United States, over fields, mountains, and even the Great Lakes, to return back to Canada to start the cycle over again. Imagine what would happen if the butterflies arrived back in Canada and found only asphalt and mowed grass? They would have no food and nowhere to rest and recover. Parks Canada is helping ensure that this doesn’t happen, and we need your help! Thankfully, when many monarchs cross Lake Erie from the United States, they are greeted by Point Pelee National Park. Point Pelee is the southernmost point of mainland Canada, and the most ecologically diverse national park in the country. Here, they are able to find an abundance of food and shelter for some much needed rest after their long journey. Some butterflies will then move north and east throughout Ontario. They may find summer homes in Parks Canada administered places like Bruce Peninsula National Park, Rouge National Urban Park, Georgian Bay Islands National Park, and more. But these are only stops in their migration. As they make their way beyond national parks, they face landscape fragmentation. This means that their habitat has been lost and broken up by urban development, roads, industrial agriculture, and more. Having to travel farther and farther before they can find habitat makes their already difficult journey even harder. To support this species at risk and many more, Parks Canada is restoring ecosystems to provide stepping stones of habitat. These stops help species move more freely and easily in their natural environment. By planting native trees, grasses, and wildflowers in protected areas, Parks Canada is creating food and habitat where migrating birds and butterflies can rest and refuel before continuing on their long journey. Parks Canada, along with Indigenous communities, partners and volunteers, have restored more than 40 hectares (98.8 acres) of meadow, coastal sand dune, and savannah habitat in national parks in Ontario. These are all habitats that are critical for pollinators. In the last 5 years, together we have also planted over 145,000 native shrubs and trees and almost 18,000 native grasses and wildflowers. Parks Canada’s work to conserve and restore healthy ecosystems that provide important habitat is only one piece in a much larger puzzle. You can be a part of the larger solution to habitat loss by providing habitat “stepping stones” too! Imagine if once a monarch butterfly moves on from a national park, it finds your yard, garden box, or balcony, filled with native plants. There, it can stop, rest, and fuel up for its journey before making its way to another protected area. If everyone planted just a few native plants or wildflowers, it would make this butterfly’s journey so much easier! You don’t need to have a big yard to make a difference. Planting a small garden or a few native plants on your balcony is important too, especially in urban areas. If you don’t have space to plant at home, you can also find out if there are any community gardens in your neighbourhood that you could join. To help out pollinators, we recommend planting a variety of native plants and wildflowers. Milkweed is especially good for monarchs because it is the only plant that monarch caterpillars eat. Check out Pollinator Partnership Canada’s Ecoregional Planting Guides or their ‘Find Your Roots’ native plant finder tool for recommended plants to plant in your area. You can also check out the Canadian Wildlife Federation’s Canadian Native Plant Suppliers List to find local businesses to purchase your plants and seeds.

A wetland is an in-between place—a mixture of water and land, beauty, and mud. As in-between places, they often go understudied and under-loved. They’re understudied partly because they’re neither terrestrial nor aquatic but something in-between, says Dr. Chantal Vis, an aquatic ecosystem specialist at Parks Canada. “You can only do so much from land,” she says, “and you can only do so much from a boat.” They’re under-loved because, for many people, they are considered waste land. Historically they have often been drained to make way for agriculture and development. This trend continues today. Southern Ontario has lost up to 68 percent of its wetlands, while urban areas in the Prairies have lost up to 96 percent. In popular culture, wetlands are often associated with snakes, monsters, and various dark influences. “The swamp is alive with a thousand eyes,” sang Jim Stafford in his 1973 hit single “Swamp Witch,” “and all of them watching you.” But if Jim Stafford had wanted to capture the truth about swamps and other wetlands, he might have included a line about “ecosystem services…and all of them working for you.” Wetlands provide a wealth of such services ranging from carbon storage to flood and pollution control. And you didn’t need to be alarmed by all those eyes, Jim. That’s just a sign of biological richness. First of all, wetlands are biofilters. As water moves through them, sediment settles to the bottom. Pollutants in the sediment are broken down by microbes. Wetland vegetation can also remove pollutants: cattails and bulrushes, for example, can absorb toxic heavy metals and fertilizer residues. It’s no wonder that wetlands are sometimes called “nature’s kidneys.” As downstream receivers of waste from both human and natural sources, they are often used to transform degraded land such as landfill sites and sewage lagoons. Besides serving as water filters, wetlands provide flood and erosion control, slowing and absorbing water. In dry times, they release the water they have stored. But their work is not limited to the local ecosystem. Wetlands absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas and contributor to climate change. This is especially true of bogs, which contain peat (partially decomposed organic matter.) Finally, wetlands are “ecological supermarkets” in terms of their biological diversity. Scientists estimate that about a third of all North American species at risk depend on wetlands. In many parts of the globe, wetlands also provide fuel and building materials. Ontario’s Rouge National Urban Park knows the value of wetlands. Working with Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, schools, community groups and Indigenous partners, the park has restored more than 60 hectares of wetland, stream and riverbank habitat since 2015. The restoration work often involves actually re-creating wetlands in places where wet habitat would historically have existed. According to Julia Phillips, ecologist at Rouge, this is not always a matter of just “digging a hole and filling it up with water.” “We look at drainage lines and, in some cases, places where we can put a berm to hold more water on the landscape,” she says. “We try to think like beavers.” Together with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Ms. Phillips and her team have created or restored a number of wetlands in the park, including some that are close to agricultural areas. Not only do the wetlands filter the agricultural run-off; they also reduce flooding on farmers’ fields, since the water has a place to go. In restoring and creating wetlands, says Ms. Phillips, “we’re recreating that spongy landscape that was there in the first place.” The work at Rouge and other national parks underlines the importance of wetlands as natural engineering systems that keep the living world healthy. “It’s the habitat we’ve lost the most of,” says Dr. Chantal Vis. “They do so much for us, and we don’t value them as much as we should.” Somebody should put that into a song.

Marine cockroach, green menace, one of the world’s 10 most unwanted species—the European green crab has been called them all. But this hated crustacean may help researchers develop a solution to the global problem of plastic pollution. Parks Canada has partnered with Dr. Audrey Moores, a McGill University chemistry professor, to explore a method of making biodegradable plastic from the shells of European green crabs. “A marriage made in heaven.” That’s how Chris McCarthy, Resource Conservation Manager for Parks Canada’s Mainland Nova Scotia Field Unit, describes the partnership. And that marriage involves an irony to savour—a green pest ends up serving the cause of “green chemistry.” The story began when Dr. Moores published a paper on using chitin (the material composing the shells of insects and crustaceans) to manufacture biodegradable plastic. Dr. Moores' paper caught the eye of Gabrielle Beaulieu, Coastal Restoration Project Manager at Kejimkujik National Park and Historic Site in Nova Scotia. Like many parts of Atlantic North America, Kejimkujik was wrestling with a green crab invasion. Ms. Beaulieu and Mr. McCarthy approached Dr. Moores about turning their problem into a solution—or at least, into the raw material for a solution. Dr. Moores “was really taken with what we were trying to do,” says Mr. McCarthy. The partnership has already resulted in a successful crowdfunding campaign through the Fathom Fund, a project of the Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network (MEOPAR). Parks Canada will contribute $20,000 to the project. The funding will allow for the hiring of a full-time researcher on the project, to be based near Kejimkujik. An enemy of eelgrass Kejimkujik’s battle with the green crab dates back to 2007, when conservation staff began to realize that something serious was happening under the water. The major symptom was the disappearance of eelgrass. Eelgrass, a marine flowering plant, serves as a nursery for undersea creatures, including many of Nova Scotia’s commercially fished species. By 2010, eelgrass coverage in Kejimkujik’s Port Joli estuary had dropped to only 2% of 1987 levels. The loss of eelgrass, says Mr. McCarthy, had a cascading effect. Not only did marine species suffer, but so did the birds that feed on those species. Adult green crabs rip out eelgrass to get at their food, which includes clams, mussels, oysters, smaller crabs and even small fish. Kejimkujik began trapping and removing green crabs using rowboats and canoes. A citizen science activity, Gone Crabbin’, lets park visitors take part in the control program. (Dr. Moores has participated in the program, an experience she describes as “a real eye-opener.”) So far, staff and volunteers have removed 2 million of the crustaceans from estuary locations in the park. As a result, nearly 40% of the original eelgrass beds have returned, and overall biodiversity of the estuary continues to improve. Kejimkujik had already had some success in encouraging a demand for the green crab as lobster bait and as an edible. This new partnership creates a year-round demand for the crustacean, says Mr. McCarthy. The project will thus benefit both coastal communities as well as coastal ecosystems—and perhaps ultimately the ocean itself. Conventional plastic is a major problem for the world’s oceans, since it does not break down and can spread throughout the food chain. One-third of the word’s plastic ends up in the ocean. Biodegradable plastic is already being made from chitin, says Dr. Moores, but on a small scale—and the methods used can be harmful to the environment. Her approach uses green chemistry to produce the plastic cleanly, on a larger scale. And so the reviled European green crab may one day actually contribute to ocean health. It’s always satisfying when a black hat becomes a white hat—or at least, a source of ingredients for the white hats’ work.

Ongoing discussions towards a comprehensive trade agreement: Building on progress from 2016, the two leaders successfully concluded the second Annual Leaders’ Dialogue where they discussed a variety of key issues and strengthened their bilateral relationship. Both sides agreed to continue exploratory discussions towards a comprehensive trade agreement to create more opportunities for people in both countries. Resolution of agrifood market access: Canada and China committed to fully implementing the 2016 agreement to expand market access for Canadian frozen bone-in beef, and Chinese filled grain products. Canada and China also agreed to start a pilot project for the export of Canadian chilled beef and pork. Partnership on Natural Resources and Energy: Canada and China agreed to work together to reduce emissions, promote clean energy solutions, and support economic growth while protecting the environment. Both sides also underlined their support to establish new Sino-Canadian eco-districts and tall wood structures using Canadian wood products and energy efficient technologies. In addition, leaders agreed to launch the Canada-China Track II Energy Dialogue to provide advice and strengthen trade and investment between the two countries. Leaders also discussed ways to facilitate the supply of Canadian uranium to the Chinese nuclear energy market. Continued law enforcement cooperation: The issue of illicit drug trafficking has no borders and bilateral law enforcement cooperation is essential to combatting the illicit manufacture and trafficking of fentanyl and other opioids. In the context of the National Security and Rule of Law Dialogue, the Prime Minister directed his officials to redouble their efforts regarding the threat of opioids. Canada welcomed China’s efforts to disrupt the illicit trafficking of fentanyl, including by classifying a number of different controlled substances under Chinese law and investigating leads provided by foreign law enforcement. Enhanced youth engagement and education ties: Canada and China reiterated their support for further opportunities for youth exchanges and international education. Both leaders welcomed the signing of a memorandum of understanding concerning the Canada Learning Initiative in China (CLIC) in order to facilitate China’s ongoing funding of CLIC scholarships for Canadian post-secondary students. Canada indicated that it will provide $4.1 million over five years to support related initiatives, including $2.5 million to increase opportunities for Canadian youth to study in China, and $1.6 million for youth internships at Canadian missions in China. Stronger cooperation on defence and security: Canada and China will continue to strengthen military-to-military interactions, including through a Royal Canadian Navy port visit to China being planned for 2018. The two sides will strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the fields of UN peacekeeping, as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster response, emphasizing the importance of the women, peace, and security agenda in the context of cooperation on UN peace operations and ongoing academic exchanges. Expansion of bilateral air linkages: In light of the Canada-China Year of Tourism and the expected growth in tourist flows, the Prime Minister emphasized the need to ensure proportionate growth in air transport services. The two leaders committed to seeking ways to further expand these services in the near future. Increased collaboration on regional and international security issues: Canada and China agreed to further engage and collaborate on pressing regional and global challenges, and exchanged views on North Korea and Myanmar. Partnership on Cultural Exchanges: Ministers from China and Canada have agreed to co-chair the inaugural meeting of the Canada-China Joint Committee on Culture in Ottawa in February 2018. This platform will provide a new opportunity for high-level dialogue on matters of mutual interest in culture, creative industries, the arts, heritage, and other areas. Cooperation on rule of law and labour: The Prime Minister also reiterated that Canada’s priorities in China include the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law, for which is announced $5 million to deepen judicial cooperation, as well as an additional $1.5 million to support work on labour and employment issues.

The Myth: Thousands if not millions of non-working people (those who did not earn the $5,000 CERB threshold) illegally collected billions of dollars and now do not want to pay it back. The federal government is right to go after them. These people took advantage of a hurried design with few safeguards and took advantage of the largesse of Canadians. The design encouraged people to stop working and they would not go back when their employers wanted them back and now they want to keep money they knowingly collected while ineligible. The Reality: Pandemic programs like the CERB were rushed out the door with massive encouragement by governments for people to apply for them, collect and stay safe. The rules changed over and over in the early days. Even now, legacy rules (that are still freely available) online contradict each other. Social assistance recipients (about 5% of Canada’s population or 1 in 20 people) were routinely legally ordered to apply for the CERB and were threatened with sanctions and penalties if they did not. Yes, there is law that forces recipients to apply for benefits even though they may not be eligible for them. Pandemic benefits were largely clawed back from other benefits they received. In the aftermath, the rules surrounding pandemic benefits were greatly tightened up in the following ways: 1. The $5000 threshold in income was restricted to the incomes covered in the legislation – much more restrictive than was communicated on websites e.g., Honourariums are noted as qualifying income online but are not covered in CERB legislation. 2. The $5000 had to be received not just earned. Many people worked but did not receive their pay because of pandemic business distress and failure. But people who earned money but did not receive it are being retroactively made ineligible for CERB. This rule not only makes no sense – CRA routinely will not accept any explanation[2] of difficulties in obtaining documentation of earnings unless they are taken to Tax Court. 3. CERB claimants were retrospectively required by the Tax Court to have bookkeeping of near forensic accounting quality and detail to prove their eligibility. If appellants can not produce detailed accounts, they are often found ineligible. 4. Claimants who ‘just missed’ in terms of their eligibility were sanctioned. The rules contained no exceptions whatever nor any room for Judges to make findings of eligibility. Exceptionality that applies to almost all programs is completely absent for pandemic benefits. 5. Hardship rules that normally apply are being significantly tightened to disallow longer payment terms. 6. Over $50 million in new funds were allocated in the Federal Budget to chase down low-income people who were found ineligible for benefits despite the many contradictions in the communications material and administration. All of this is turning out to be incredibly destructive and is overshadowing the fact that Canada managed to meet its poverty goals nine years early. This incredible achievement – instead of being celebrated – is being falsely seen by some as a failed experiment in protecting our most vulnerable residents.

Working in open government means learning how to listen to citizens and stakeholders. When it comes to how the Government of Canada approaches citizen engagement, over and over again we have heard a recurring theme: it must be authentic and meaningful. To help us achieve this goal, we’ve developed a set of principles and guidelines with the goal of ensuring that the Government of Canada engagement on policy issues is: 1.	Transparent 2.	Relevant 3.	Inclusive 4.	Accountable 5.	Adaptable This post answers how we got to those principles, and what’s behind them. Our first really large engagement process was conducted in 2013 to support the development of Canada’s second Action Plan on Open Government. Talking to Canadians, we heard concerns about meaningful engagement and turned that advice into a commitment to “Develop a set of principles and standards for public consultations in discussion with citizens and civil society.” To meet this commitment, we started with an environmental scan to see what others around the world were doing. After reviewing existing practices, we took our show on the road. We conducted workshops with the federal government’s regulatory community, our resident experts who are required by law to consult when revisions or changes are being proposed. We also raised the problem for discussion with the academic community at the Congress of Humanities and Social Sciences in June 2015. The next step was the Canadian Open Dialogue Forum where we helped co-create a set of principles with more than 200 participants from civil society, government, academia and business during a two-day conference in March 2016. Before, during and after the event, participants debated and pulled together ideas and reactions, which resulted in a draft list of 16 principles. We kept on consulting, refining and editing to ensure that both the government and our community was satisfied with a document that reflected openness. Along the way, we got some things wrong and needed to alter course, even after a lot of discussion. For example, at Govmaker in 2016 we proposed the principle that “participants should know what’s on and off the table” to maximize relevance. The counter-argument – with which the room agreed - was that if the process is truly “open” then nothing should be entirely off the table. We also heard that the principles were written as though the Government of Canada would decide the issues, decide the approach, and take responsibility. Instead, we heard calls for co-creation of engagement processes and shared accountability, which are now reflected. The result of this effort was a set of principles for engagement between government and citizens. We are now experimenting with applying the principles to public consultations, and are working to develop more detailed guidance about applying these principles in action. We are also working on using the principles as a basis for measuring the effectiveness of different types of public engagement activities being run by the Government of Canada. One of the most crucial needs is to keep working on effective relationships and engagement with indigenous peoples and nations. Watch this spot for a future blog post on measuring the effectiveness of the principles and exploring the relationship between engagement and trust in government. Thank you, and we look forward to learning with you. Thom Kearney and for the Open Government Team

As the Minister responsible for Open Government, I invite you to celebrate Open Government Week with citizens and their governments from around the world. You can find an event online or near you to learn about open government, to connect with others interested in civic life, and to find ways to strengthen our communities and our democracy. These are important conversations. Open Government Week is part of a growing global movement, led by the international Open Government Partnership (OGP). Canada was honoured to be selected to serve as the lead government chair of the OGP for 2018-2019. We want to use this position to raise the bar with our partners around the world over the next year. The ultimate goal of the partnership is to use open government to better the lives of people the world over. We believe that increased citizen participation and oversight of the workings of governments will lead to better programs and services for citizens. And if we’re persistent, we think that we might just deepen civic engagement, bolster trust and, ultimately, strengthen our democracy. So we are stepping up in Canada and investing deeply in open government. Take a look at our portal, and the tens of thousands of data sets on there, for a sense of our work. You can also check out our open government tracker for an idea of the work that’s happening across the government. We are also supporting other countries on their own journeys. We consider this a fundamental investment in the success of modern democracies around the world. These are things Canada believes in. I’ve written in the past about Canada’s priorities for our term as co-chair of the OGP: participation, impact, and inclusion. They will drive our efforts with the international community to strengthen civic space around the world, and they will drive the work we do in Canada to strengthen our own democracy and to set an example worldwide. Government ultimately belongs to the people it serves. So we will also work with governments to make public engagement and civic participation critical elements of public policy development. We will publish our targets, measure our impact and share our accomplishments and our struggles in delivering on results so that we can learn and grow together. And we will strive to ensure that under-represented citizens, regardless of gender, race, or sexual orientation, can participate actively in policy-making. We also commit to supporting countries to help women and girls gain more meaningful access to public decisions that directly impact their lives for the better. Inclusivity is fundamental: when we are faced with complex problems, we need a diversity of views, experiences, backgrounds, orientations and ideas to get the best solutions. Open Government Week is a way to highlight the different ways we can create space for dialogue and improve Canada together. When we open our governments, we need to open them to everyone. I hope that you will help us make this change. Share your ideas. Work with us on our next Action Plan. Hold us accountable for our progress. You can do all of this starting from open.canada.ca. Canada has a track record in leading global open government efforts thanks to the ideas, input and involvement of Canadians. For Open Government Week I invite you to explore, participate and join other Canadians and people around the world by attending events and participating in the #OpenGovWeek conversations that interest you. Thank you for helping us build a better Canada and a better world.

In my first blog post, I’d like to share my broader reflections on the core work of the RDU and describe our role, goals and day-to-day work, beyond our more visible work tracking progress on mandate letter commitments and reporting on outcomes (more on those in my next post). First, we work to prepare materials for the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Committee on Agenda, Results and Communications. These materials – usually in the form of dashboards, heat maps and short progress reports -- outline progress on key priorities and discuss where attention might be needed. For example, our reports highlighted progress on gender-based budgeting and analysis across the system, as well as improved recruitment of under-represented groups in Canada’s uniformed and security agencies, but also identified where more progress was needed. Having a short stock take meeting with the Prime Minister and key leaders, supported by data, was a very helpful way to accelerate progress. As a result, there is now greater clarity across the public service that the Prime Minister expects targets to be met and rigorous gender-based analysis and budgeting on all new proposals. In practice, this means that analyses of proposals will more thoroughly assess the differential impact on different groups, like women or racialized communities. We will be finalizing shortly our approach to publicly sharing these reports on results we do for the Prime Minister. Second, we help departments as they prepare new policy and program submissions. Our focus is on three simple questions: what are you really hoping to achieve? How will you achieve it? How will you evaluate whether you’re achieving it and adjust if things aren’t going well? This usually means offering advice to departments on their submissions to Cabinet, but could also involve looking in more detail at their programs. Recently, we’ve worked with departments as they clarified their policy goals and their evaluation strategies on many issues, including reducing homelessness, increasing broadband coverage in remote and rural communities, targeting the opioid crisis, improving outcomes for job training programs and reducing the carbon footprint of the federal government. Third, we work closely with departments day-to-day to help Ministers overcome obstacles to successful delivery of their initiatives within the system. That means that rather than letting problems fester, we surface problems, direct them to the right decision-making forum, and try to accelerate progress. In some cases, we undertake deeper dives on high priority issues that are not progressing as quickly as anticipated. This involves examining the overall delivery chain and all of the various partners and policies that may help or hinder successful delivery, which could include the federal government’s own rules on procurement and contracting, slow decision-making or capacity on the ground with partners. One such recent example is long-term boil water advisories on reserve. This has been a complicated issue that has been difficult to resolve. So, a joint team, composed of representatives from the departments, from PCO and from communities has been mapping out the delivery chain and identifying challenges. These three functions were not previously performed in a systematic way across the federal government. Of course, each in their own way was sometimes undertaken in response to particular situations, but not systematically in an on-going way. All of them are designed to support a larger objective: shift the culture of the federal government to one more preoccupied with implementation issues and focused on outcomes. This means more investment in people who can deliver programs and projects, and more investment in data and evaluation to determine what results are being achieved. So “Results & Delivery” isn’t just the name of the unit – they are our mission every day. I guess we’re an autonym. This blog will be a place where I describe what we’re doing and discuss the challenges the public service confronts as we move towards a more outcomes-focused organization. In my next post I will discuss our approach to public reporting and what comes next.

As UK Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude has said, transparency is a powerful idea whose time has come. Advances in technology and communications, and rising public expectations have created a situation where being transparent is not just a matter of “we can,” but “we should” – more open government is more efficient government, more accountable and more responsive to the needs of citizens. Open data has a huge role to play, and governments have an unmissable opportunity to feed the appetite for this 21st century raw material. Over the next decade, data will change the way we live, work and think. Apps based on real-time transport data, showing when your train or bus is arriving, are now commonplace; data on the performance of schools and doctors are enhancing citizen voice and choice in public services. Just last week, Francis Maude announced an extension of the Family and Friends Test across the National Health Service (NHS) and into other public services, allowing people to give feedback on their experience. The possibilities are endless. Using freely available map data from OS OpenData, a team at mapping authority Ordnance Survey created a map of Great Britain for the Minecraft computer game, demonstrating the educational potential of this data. The UK Government wants to be the most transparent in the world. We can legitimately claim to be a leader in open data, with over 10,000 datasets at http://www.data.gov.uk/. But it’s not enough simply to release data – it must be accessible and easy to use and share. The sheer volume of data we hold also means we must prioritise what is going to be of greatest value. That is why we have been consulting with citizens, businesses and civil society to identify the core data for our National Information Infrastructure, and ensure its availability to developers and entrepreneurs to build information-led businesses and stimulate economic growth. With international partners, including Canada, we are part of a global movement supporting the transformational impact of transparency and open government. This took a huge step forward at June’s G8 summit in Northern Ireland – all member states signed an Open Data Charter for making their data as widely accessible as possible, in a format useable by all, and establishing an expectation that all government data be published openly by default. The UK and Canada are also participants in the Open Government Partnership (OGP), a worldwide initiative – now involving 60 countries – to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies. The recent joint UK-Canada Google Hangout on open data underlines our commitment to making our own governments more transparent and accountable. We will both be publishing OGP National Action Plans in support of the Open Data Charter. We also want to work together to extend the release and use of open data – including adoption of the G8 Charter by more countries, and greater public sector engagement  to foster innovation and growth. The theme of open data will run through the OGP annual summit, which the UK is hosting in a few weeks. The event will bring together world leaders and civil society representatives to share success stories, check that previous transparency promises are being kept, and set ambitious new commitments on openness. The international collaboration, sharing of best practice and open scrutiny of governments’ progress against commitments that the OGP enables are crucial to embedding transparency as a credible force for change. Events like the Hangout with Minister Clement are valuable opportunities to spread the word of transparency and open data, and draw in ideas and insight from far and wide. I hope it’s the first of many.

As Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the Government of Canada in this new world dominated by platforms revolutionizing entire industries such as Uber, Airbnb or Alibaba, I frequently ask myself “How long will it be before governments worldwide are ‘platformed’?” This is a central question, not only to my work, but to the daily life of every Canadian citizen. A question I decided to address in the article The Government of Canada’s Information Technology Strategic Plan published in the August 2017 edition of the Public Sector Digest. My key message is straightforward: in this new digital and interconnected era, we need to completely rethink the operating model of government. We must look at our government not in a linear way where public services are only provided by public servants but rather as an exponential platform where information is available and used by third parties to deliver services to citizens on behalf of the government. Yet, to date, the Government of Canada has operated in an environment where information is not released by default, where partnerships are not easily cultivated and where linear approaches to engagement fundamentally hinder the ability of government to serve citizens. This is why last year we released our Information Technology Strategic Plan for 2016-2020 as a first foundational change in our approach to digital. This plan is an attempt to harness the impacts of technology in the federal ecosystem by focusing on how the government manages its technological assets, how it grows its people and how it governs the enterprise. In other words, the Government of Canada, across all levels of its operations, needs to change and adjust more quickly to increasingly rapid developments in our society. There is no doubt that we will continue to invest federal funding over the long term in areas such as superclusters, artificial intelligence and other revolutionary technologies. However, we have to reap the benefits of these investments much sooner. We must also move towards a mindset where open government and service agendas are at the forefront of our thinking to create the conditions for government to operate as a platform. I highlighted some paths forwards in the article, starting with directing our focus on tools that allow the Government of Canada to engage in a modern way. Proper technology architecture is essential to meet citizens’ expectations and the new business needs of the public service. We must also take innovative approaches to keep up with new procurement needs and enhance our collaboration with an increasing number of partners. All of this is an effort to have a more open government. Finally, and more importantly, we have to place the people at the centre of our efforts over the coming years. We must grow a public service for the future that is more inclusive of new approaches and ways of doing things. We must empower our people to engage and think digitally. A fundamental change is required in our public service to keep pace with this new world. We must adjust to meet both traditional needs and new realities. This is a challenge I accepted when I became the Government of Canada’s CIO. And I am thrilled to work with the Chief Information Office staff to pave the way forward in modernizing the public service technology landscape for the benefit of all Canadian citizens.

In 2015, Canadians elected our Liberal government on a platform that included a pledge to “change Parliament’s financial processes so that government accounting is more consistent and clear.” We are making good on that promise. Canadians, and those elected to represent them, have a right to know where public funds are going and how they will be spent. The ability to follow the money is foundational for representative democracy, which is why our government has recently made important changes to improve the clarity, transparency and accountability of government spending. Every year, government tables the Main Estimates in Parliament laying out its spending plans for the coming year. And just about every year, new initiatives announced in the federal budget do not get included in the Main Estimates, because the Main Estimates have almost always been prepared and tabled in the House of Commons before the Budget. You couldn’t directly compare the two documents, which created confusion. It left parliamentarians largely in the dark, a system the Globe and Mail once described as “bad to the point of absurdity.” We have effectively solved this problem. We’ve changed the order so that the Main Estimates come after the Budget, and we’ve included a Budget Implementation vote in the Main Estimates. For the first time in recent history, the Main Estimates, which I tabled on April 16th, include 100% of the measures announced in the Budget for this year. Parliamentarians have more accurate, detailed information and they are better able to hold government to account for how it spends taxpayer dollars. This is a major step forward in government accountability. To do this, we have added a new centrally managed Budget Implementation vote to the existing list of centrally managed votes in the Main Estimates. By law, Treasury Board, the Cabinet Committee that manages what funds go to which department, can only allocate these funds to specific new budget measures, as per the Budget’s detailed list of funding for every new spending measure.  Anything else would be an unauthorized use of public money. Economists Scott Clark and Peter DeVries gave Budget 2018 an “A” grade for fiscal credibility, writing that “with respect to transparency the 2018 Budget provides more detailed financial analysis and information than any budget that we can remember, and we go back a long way. For critics of the Budget who felt such information was lacking, they should perhaps take the time to read the Annexes.” And Auditor General Michael Ferguson has observed that under Vote 40, "you have to allocate it on that basis, you can't just decide somebody else should get more and somebody else can get less. To me that's not the authority that they've been given by Parliament." We are showing Parliament exactly where in the Budget the funding for the new Budget Implementation vote comes from and how it will be used. Parliamentarians can now literally follow the money from this new central vote to a specific line in the Budget and the Main Estimates. And for added clarity, we will include the allocations from Annex 1 of the Main Estimates directly in the Supply bill to be voted on by parliamentarians this spring. This increased transparency is made possible by the unprecedented level of detail provided in the Budget on new spending measures by department. We will also show Parliament exactly how Treasury Board is allocating funds to departments for specific budget measures, through monthly online reporting and in the Supplementary Estimates throughout the year. How will this work? Take for example the New Women Entrepreneurship Strategy, intended to help women entrepreneurs grow their businesses and create jobs. With new monthly online reporting, Canadians can track funds committed to the Strategy, broken out by federal agency, as we expand support for women in business. Through three previous committee appearances on Estimates reform, and another this week, I am openly and constructively engaging my fellow parliamentarians in this reform exercise. Thanks to these important changes, parliamentarians now have better oversight of government spending than ever before. I firmly believe the result will be better, more transparent government for all Canadians.

I have taught policy at the community level, to ODSP and OW recipients, at Foundations, for governments, agencies and volunteers. At most of these venues, I have also taught benefit design and just to make it easy on myself, I have written a deck on understanding benefit design and the 10 principles of good benefit design. The CERB and CRB do not observe 4 of the ten principles and in many ways, I don’t blame the designers. I contend that all the best minds in benefit design would not have done any better. It is impossible to design such a large suite of programs without making mistakes and taking a lot of shortcuts. Canada was justly lauded for the magnitude, the effective delivery and the speed at which its pandemic benefits were rolled out. When speed is one of the most important objectives, canvassing principles of effective delivery of benefits is not necessarily top of mind. But as I noted in my first entry, two wrongs don’t make a right. What you get wrong going out the door, you certainly have the opportunity to make right on appeal. That’s what the government has done for students, the self-employed and low-income seniors and that is at the heart of my objections in this series. So let’s look at the violations as the CERB and CRB were blown out the door. My first principle is to align program objectives with design. The overriding program objective of pandemic benefits was to keep people safe and indoors during the early part of the pandemic. Another objective was to help people who lost their jobs and who were unable to go back to work. The CERB and the CRB used the $5,000 threshold of 2019 earnings as a proxy to provide pandemic benefits for people who suffered job loss. The CERB and CRB do not meet the first principle as people whose earnings were less than $5,000 also suffered job loss and many were forced to keep working during the most dangerous part of the pandemic. But the amount of $5,000 – at bottom -was arbitrary. The second principle is to align Canadian values with design parameters. I don’t know where I would find a Canadian value that stipulates that pandemic benefits should be restricted to people who earned over $5,000. Yes, Canadians believe in helping people who have lost their jobs or we would not have EI or welfare programs. But the $5,000 threshold is nowhere to be found in the value ecosystem of Canadians. Therefore, the second design principle is not met mostly because the $5,000 threshold came from out of the blue. The third principle is to understand benefit structure. The CERB and CRB were incredibly innovative and it’s difficult to know whether they were paid to the people who the government intended to pay. We do know that the rules kept changing after the benefit was in pay – what counted as income – to whom – when and how. But it’s hard to say that the CERB and CRB violate the principle of understanding benefit structure. There was simply too little time to study it. The fourth principle is perhaps the most important: Understanding the four elements of an income test. In the case of the CERB and CRB – the recovery or tax back rate on income is simply entirely missing. There is no on ramp or off ramp. You are either eligible or you are not. Miss the threshold by even one cent and you are ineligible. Add a cent and you are eligible. No other income tested benefit has no on and off ramps: GIS, the CCB, the CWB, all income assistance programs. The lack of on and off ramps – even if you are designing in a hurry is a violation of a fundamental principle of design.

Investing in public transit is about investing in Canadians. With projects that get people where they need to go, we help commuters save time and money, we create good middle-class jobs, and we keep our air clean for generations to come. The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was joined today by the Premier of Quebec, François Legault, the Mayor of Montréal, Valérie Plante, and the President and Chief Executive Officer of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Charles Emond, in Montréal, Quebec, for the launch of phase 1 of the Réseau express métropolitain (REM), a major public transit project linking several suburbs with downtown Montréal. With the launch of phase 1 today, five stations will now provide public transit services from the South Shore’s Brossard Station to downtown Montréal’s Central Station, crossing the St. Lawrence River via the iconic Samuel De Champlain Bridge. The REM is the largest public transit project undertaken in Quebec in the last 50 years and the result of extensive partnership, including a record investment from the federal government’s Canada Infrastructure Bank. Once fully completed, the REM will double the length of the existing metro system, link the communities of the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue) and the North Shore (Laval and Deux-Montagnes) to downtown Montréal, and create a fast link to Montréal-Trudeau International Airport. The REM will make it possible to travel from downtown Montréal to one of Canada’s largest air travel hubs in only 25 minutes, regardless of traffic. Once fully operational, the REM – a fully electric metro – will help cut emissions by 100,000 tonnes per year, which is equivalent to removing 30,000 cars from our roads each day. The REM is also expected to add significant economic benefits to the Greater Montréal Area, including 34,000 jobs during construction, 1,000 permanent jobs, and over $2 billion in wages paid in Quebec. It is expected to accommodate up to 170,000 users per day. Projects like this one are a significant part of our plan to fight climate change, create good jobs, and make our communities even better places to call home. Today’s announcement means Montrealers will have a faster commute, less time in traffic, cleaner air, and more money back in their pockets. 1.	In all, about 30,000 commuters a day will be able to use phase 1, which can cover 16.6 kilometres in just 18 minutes. 2.	When complete, the REM will add 26 stations and 67 kilometres of tracks to Montréal’s current metro network – doubling the length of the current system. 3.	The Canada Infrastructure Bank is investing a record $1.28 billion into the REM public transit project, and an additional $300 million for the construction of the REM terminus station at the Montréal-Trudeau International Airport. The Government of Canada’s Airport Critical Infrastructure Program is also investing an additional $100 million in the airport’s REM station. 4.	With a current total project cost of $6.9 billion, the REM is the result of extensive partnership between the Government of Canada through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, CDPQ Infra, REM inc., the Government of Quebec, Aéroports de Montréal, and Hydro-Québec. 5.	The Canada Infrastructure Bank was established under the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act in 2017 and seeks to invest in large, transformational, and revenue-generating infrastructure projects that are in the public interest, foster clean economic growth, and contribute to the sustainability of infrastructure in Canada. 6.	Since 2015, the Government of Canada has invested over $22 billion on more than 1,800 public transit projects across Canada. These investments are expected to build more than 400 kilometres of new public transit subway and light rail line, purchase over 3,000 zero-emission buses, and create almost 1,700 kilometres of active transportation trails, bike and pedestrian lanes, and recreational paths.

Frontline workers represent the face of organizations and make up the lion’s share of the workforce. Gartner estimates that there are 2.7 billion frontline workers — more than twice the number of desk-based workers.i The current macroeconomic climate highlighted by labor and supply chain shortages has put a lot of pressure on these workers to carry more work as organizations drive efficiency across business operations. The recent Work Trend Index shows that there is an opportunity for digital tools to help ease the burden on these essential workers. Over 60% of frontline workers struggle with having to do repetitive or menial tasks that take time away from more meaningful work and not having enough of the necessary resources to get their work done efficiently.ii In addition, 1 in 2 frontline workers cite being burned out in their jobs, and 45% note they are likely to consider changing employers in the next year.ii Investment in technology that enables frontline workers to thrive is a huge opportunity for business leaders – one that will drive positive outcomes for employees, customers, and the bottom line if solved correctly. Today, over 60% of the Fortune 500 use Microsoft 365 to empower frontline workers. Microsoft is committed to investing in innovative solutions to help frontline workers thrive. With AI transforming productivity across most segments of the workforce, our survey found that 65% of frontline workers are optimistic that AI will help them in their jobs.ii. We are excited to introduce new tools and integrations including bringing the power of next-generation AI to the frontline across three key areas: 1.	Intelligent operations 2.	Effortless communication 3.	Trusted experiences These innovations will improve efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and enable faster decision making. YouTube Video Intelligent operations Whether it’s for an inspection, installation or a maintenance request, frontline service managers want to spend their time helping their team deliver exceptional service operations and not on inefficient tasks like copying and pasting information from one system to another. We seek to infuse the productivity applications frontline managers use everyday with the robust data and intelligence of underlying business applications. This helps streamline the frontline experience and drive efficiency with operations. 1.	Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service with Outlook and Microsoft Teams integrations brings the power of next-generation AI to service professionals on the frontline. Frontline service managers who receive customer escalations in Outlook or Microsoft Teams can use Copilot in Dynamics 365 to streamline work order creation with relevant details pre-populated from emails or chats, optimize technician scheduling with data-driven recommendations based on factors such as travel time, availability and skillset, as well as generate draft responses to customer messages summarizing next steps without switching apps. 2.	Dynamics 365 Field Service app in Microsoft Teams will enable frontline technicians to access key work order functionality in their flow of work. Technicians will now be able to see upcoming work orders at a glance in their home experience in Teams, share full work order details and easily access Dynamics 365 Remote Assist in one click to troubleshoot with remote experts in real time if they need additional support to complete jobs. Maintaining end-to-end visibility on operations can be time-consuming for frontline managers with fluctuating team schedules and often a large, dispersed team. Soon Microsoft 365 Copilot can ground prompts and retrieve insights for frontline managers, leveraging data from the Shifts app with a new Shifts plugin for Microsoft 365 Copilot, in addition to user and company data it has access to such as Teams chat history, SharePoint, emails and more. This will enable frontline managers to quickly get a list of important items specific to their team and location to speed up time-consuming tasks like covering shifts and onboarding new employees.

The Digital Transformation Office carried out a wayfinding research project to better understand how people navigate different parts of the Government of Canada’s web presence. We worked with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Veterans Affairs Canada and Statistics Canada to investigate how people use the global theme and topic menu on Canada.ca. We knew that some institutions were finding that the menu wasn’t meeting their more complex navigation needs. In some cases, this prevented a few institutions from adopting the Canada.ca design. To find a solution we needed to look beyond the menu and toward navigation habits as a whole to see how institutions could meet user needs effectively. The Wayfinding project The research included a baseline study to discover and assess findability problems and a comparison study to test possible solutions. Our findings have informed changes to the Canada.ca design. Research and prototyping activities explored options to remove the menu while maintaining or improving the effectiveness of global navigation. We also wanted to preserve the confidence and trust we’ve established with the Canada.ca site brand. Our prototype included the following design elements for testing: 1.	a global header without a menu 2.	theme links from the menu moved to the footer 3.	a Sign in button in the global header 4.	more prominent breadcrumb links 5.	a simplified theme page template We applied the new design to pages that were already using the Canada.ca design, as well as pages that weren't. Task success remained consistent and there was even an improvement for navigating between themes. One of the reasons for the consistent performance is that breadcrumbs are used more often than the global menu for navigation. People can find their destination when there are clear links to theme-level pages in the breadcrumb. We also found that people use the menu to find a way to sign into their account. Since signing in is a top task on Canada.ca, we exposed a contextual Sign in button on relevant pages to see how it affected use of the menu. We put it at the top-right, just below the global header, where people typically look for signing into an account. It worked. Applying these design changes maintained or improved task success in the comparison round of testing. Check out our research summary for more details. A transitional approach These are complex changes to a site that people depend on every day. To minimize disruption for users, we’re using a transitional approach to make these design improvements to our navigation. Some of the work has already been done and more is in progress. This is our roll-out plan. 1. Updates to the Canada.ca homepage Analysis of footer usage patterns on the home page vs all other pages showed that some footer links were used a lot from the Canada.ca homepage, but very little from elsewhere in the site. We’ve moved these links out of the footer and into the content section of the Canada.ca homepage. This makes them more visible where people actually use them and frees up space in the footer for more appropriate links. 2. Contextual Sign in button The global header now includes the contextual Sign in button. It’s an optional element to be used on pages where people are likely looking to sign in to an account. We saw that a lot of people used the global menu to access a sign in page. When signing in is a top task, presenting a Sign in button in the top right of the content area makes signing in more obvious and easy to find. As people become accustomed to seeing and using the sign in button in a relevant and consistent spot below the header, they will depend less on the menu to find and sign in to their accounts. 3. Footer updates To further reduce dependency on the theme and topic menu, we’ve made some adjustments to the Global footer. The new Global footer will be made up of three content bands.

Carousels are a set of rotating slides that display multiple items within the same space on a web page. Organizations often use them to promote new activities, initiatives, programs, and services. When communications teams are juggling multiple requests for promotional space, it’s tempting to use a carousel that can cycle through several promotions and expose a segment of your audience to each. But…they are not very effective promotional tools. People just don’t click them. Let’s look at why that is and how you can design content that is more successful at reaching your audience. Banner blindness: people avoid ads “Services should be built to address the needs of users, not the internal constraints or complexities of government. To deliver value to users, teams must understand and prioritize users’ needs.” – Government of Canada Digital Standards Carousels may meet organizational needs of having content front and center, but users scroll past them because they look like ads. Believing that your content will be noticed because it is in a carousel is incorrect. The opposite is true. In 2016, the Digital   Office conducted an eye tracking study. Participants barely looked at more than the bottom corner of the carousel, and they didn’t scan more than the first few words of the caption. The red in the heatmap of the image shows that they consistently read the page title and description before looking further down the page. Based in part on this study, we stopped using carousels on the home page of Canada.ca and other top-level navigation pages. We also saw this behaviour when we worked with Global Affairs Canada in 2019 to improve some key travel tasks. Their Traveller’s checklist was prominently featured with an attractive graphic in their carousel at the top of the page. 89% of participants failed to find it. When we removed the carousel and added a text link within the page called Planning your trip, 100% of people successfully followed the link and found the checklist. Accessibility: carousels can be distracting In addition to avoiding them because they look like ads, people avoid carousels because they move. That movement can be distracting and sometimes users don’t have time to finish reading the text before the slide changes. Have you ever tried to read something, and then it moves? Frustrating, isn’t it? Instead of being subjected to an arbitrary timed process, users should control their own reading. Accessibility and inclusivity have to be at the forefront of your design. Making content accessible means a wide range of people can use it, including people with physical and cognitive disabilities (for example, reading disorders, attention deficit disorders, memory disorders). A time and place for carousels While there are good reasons to avoid carousels for promotional purposes, there are times when they can be effective. On a page designed as an image gallery for example, they can work well. For this reason we’ve left the pattern in the Canada.ca design system, but we’ve updated the guidance for when and how to use it. Now, you are probably wondering: “How do I do effective promotions then?” Start by focusing your approach on user behaviour and outcomes. Tailor your message Look at how to tailor your message to the visitor, based on where they are on the site. Make sure promotions are clearly related to the content of the page. Promoting access to a free tax clinic on a page about taxes makes lots of sense. This promotion would be less effective on a page that had nothing to do with taxes.

“Design with users” is one of the Government of Canada’s Digital Standards. But how do you design with users when you’re under the pressure of tight deadlines and financial constraints? A key part of building digital services that work for users is developing a good understanding of who your users are, what their needs are and how your service will impact their lives. Are you working with your call centres? Call centre agents are privy to the good stuff – all of your customers’ unfiltered complaints, grievances, praise, product blessings, and much, much more. They are an existing source of valuable insights from your many audiences. Whether you run an in-house call centre or outsource your call centre to a trusted partner, agents are the key to harnessing customer feedback. Using this data can help you improve your web content and services with real people in mind. Here is an example of how working with call centre staff helped us make quick content improvements to deliver better service on Canada.ca. Call centre data is design research At the end of March 2020, there were a lot of calls and emails coming into all call centres about Employment Insurance (EI) and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). Very high volumes of calls were coming into the Government of Canada’s main 1-800 O Canada number and email managed by Service Canada. The fact that call centres were swamped was making the news, as worried Canadians waited for hours to get help with their cases. This called for swift action. Service Canada asked for help from the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) to improve their phone and email contact pages. The objective was to encourage more self-serve behaviour from people visiting the web site. They wanted to build on success we had had working on contact pages with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), in the hopes of reducing call volumes. Swamped call centres don’t make anyone happy We used the web analytics and call volumes in early April 2020 as a baseline measurement to help us understand if our interventions were working. At that time: 1.	call wait times spanned multiple hours, and many people couldn’t get through 2.	email response time was backlogged beyond the standard 48-hour window 3.	the Public Health Agency’s call centre was transferring hundreds of calls each day for CERB and EI topics (nearly 800 on April 1 alone) Designing based on behaviour The original page had a long alert at the top about call wait times and included links to other pages where answers could be found. We hypothesized that people weren’t really reading the long alert, and that they were reluctant to leave the contact page because they’d already decided they needed to contact someone. There was no incentive to search elsewhere for answers because there was a helpline phone number right in front of them. We prototyped and tested two ideas. First, we tried a much smaller alert banner at the top of the page. The original alert took more than a full mobile screen and included links away from the page. The new alert was a single sentence. It encouraged people to look at the information on the page for their answer before calling. Second, we tried putting answers to the most-asked questions right at the top of the page, using the expand/collapse pattern. This way, people didn’t have to leave the page. They could expand only the answer they were actually looking for. Using the expand/collapse pattern meant we could keep the page short and simple, while providing the content that people needed most. Testing these solutions showed positive results. People looked for the answers on the page and found them.

Introduction The purpose of this memorandum is to communicate to school boards the revised provincial Code of Conduct. The provincial Code of Conduct has been revised to include a restriction on the use of personal mobile devices during instructional time. The use of personal mobile devices during instructional time is permitted under the following circumstances: 1.	for educational purposes, as directed by an educator 2.	for health and medical purposes 3.	to support special education needs School boards have a duty under the Ontario Human Rights Code to provide appropriate accommodations to students and employees of the board, including educators. If a student or other person employed by the board requires the use of a personal mobile device as an accommodation under the Human Rights Code, school boards are obligated to allow such accommodation. This memorandum also gives direction to school boards on reviewing their own codes of conduct and the local codes of conduct in their schools. Boards must review their codes of conduct to ensure that they are consistent with the revised provincial Code of Conduct. Boards should note that subsection 301(2) of Part XIII of the Education Act outlines the purposes of the provincial Code of Conduct. In accordance with subsection 301(3.1), if a board enters into an agreement with a third party with respect to rental of school space or for the provision of before- and after-school programs, the board must include in the agreement a requirement that the other party follow standards that are consistent with the provincial Code of Conduct. A school should be a place that promotes responsibility, respect, civility, and academic excellence in a safe learning and teaching environment. A positive school climate exists when all members of the school community feel safe, included, and accepted, and actively promote positive behaviours and interactions. Building and sustaining a positive school climate is a complex challenge requiring evidence-informed solutions. A whole-school approach, which involves all members of the school community, is also important in supporting efforts to ensure that schools are safe, inclusive, and accepting. It is an effective approach to making systemic changes that will benefit all students and the broader community. All students, parents, and teachers and other school staff have the right to be safe, and to feel safe, in their school community. With this right comes the responsibility to contribute to a positive school climate. To foster a positive school climate that supports student achievement and well-being, school boards should focus on prevention and early intervention strategies to address inappropriate behaviour. The provincial Code of Conduct sets clear provincial standards of behaviour. These standards of behaviour apply to students whether they are on school property, in a virtual learning environment, on school buses, at school-related events or activities, in before- and after-school programs, or in other circumstances that could have an impact on the school climate. They also apply to all individuals involved in the publicly funded school system – principals, teachers, early childhood educators, other school staff, parents, school bus drivers, volunteers, and members of various community groups. Responsible citizenship involves appropriate participation in the civic life of the school community. Active and engaged citizens are aware of their rights, but more importantly, they accept responsibility for protecting their rights and the rights of others. Requirements for school boards All school boards must ensure that their codes of conduct are: 1.	up to date and consistent with the provincial Code of Conduct, as outlined in this memorandum 2.	compliant with all Ministry of Education policies as well as the requirements of the Education Act, its regulations and all other applicable legislation, including the Ontario Human Rights Code 3.	made available to the public, either on the school board's website or, if the board does not have a website, in another appropriate manner

Senior political staffers at Queen’s Park are being reminded in a memo from their superiors to follow conflict-of-interest rules after an Auditor-General’s report last week concluded that the government’s removal of lands from the protected Greenbelt favoured certain developers. The Premier’s Office sent a copy of the memo, signed by Premier Doug Ford’s chief of staff, Patrick Sackville, and Ontario’s top civil servant, Secretary of the Cabinet Michelle DiEmanuele, to reporters on Monday. Addressed to the chiefs of staff for members of cabinet and to deputy ministers, the memo reminds them to follow the Public Service of Ontario Act, which includes “rules regarding conflict of interest and political activity” and requires public servants to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. It says that a comprehensive response to the auditor’s report is being prepared, with a working group to oversee its implementation. The memo is an attempt to address a number of the recommendations made by Auditor-General Bonnie Lysyk, who issued a 93-page report last week declaring that the Greenbelt decision was “biased” and “seriously flawed” and lacked the necessary environmental and financial analysis. The government has said it accepts all but one of her recommendations – her centrepiece call for the Greenbelt decision itself to be revisited. Monday’s brief memo warns ministers’ chiefs of staff that proposals submitted to cabinet or its committees must “provide accurate and complete information,” including the outlining of options and risks, and show that consultation, including with Indigenous leaders, has been done. Ms. Lysyk had said the Greenbelt proposal put before cabinet last year was missing vital details about how the land was largely chosen by Ryan Amato, the chief of staff to Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark, rather than apolitical civil servants. Her report shows that Mr. Amato, put into his role by the Premier’s Office last year, received submissions that ended up accounting for the bulk of the removals from two prominent developers at an industry banquet. Those same developers are now among the landowners who stand to reap an $8.3-billion windfall in increased land values with the lifting of Greenbelt protections, the report said. The Premier’s Office, acting on another recommendation, has asked the Integrity Commissioner, already probing the Greenbelt decision, to determine if Mr. Amato broke any rules in his dealings with developers. Last week’s audit report also singled out the practice of making the civil servants involved in the Greenbelt decision sign strict non-disclosure agreements, which made it impossible for them to consult municipalities or other experts. Chiefs of staff are now being asked to report any proposed use of confidentiality agreements to the cabinet office or the Treasury Board Secretariat. In light of the submissions from developers, the memo also reminds them to follow existing requirements to document any materials or proposals they receive from people outside government. The Opposition NDP dismissed the memo as more spin from the government, which has launched a communications push in recent days to counter the information in Ms. Lysyk’s report. “It’s embarrassing, frankly, as well as painfully obvious, that Doug Ford is trying in any way he can to deflect blame for the corrupt Greenbelt removals he and his Housing Minister are wholly responsible for,” NDP spokeswoman Jodie Shupac said. The government memo was released just after Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy addressed the media on Monday to unveil the province’s first-quarter financial results. Questioned by reporters, he defended the government’s decision to go ahead with the removal of 3,000 hectares from the protected Greenbelt despite the audit’s findings, saying it was necessary amid the housing crisis. He also dismissed multiple expert reports saying Ontario already had enough land for housing, citing recent numbers showing that 500,000 new residents came to the province in just the past year.

My name is John Stapleton. I am a resident and a voter in Scarborough North. I study social and economic policy. I have lived in Northern Scarborough for the last 44 years. In the new millennium, I have been President of a Canadian non-profit Board and a Chair of an Ontario agency. I currently chair an Ontario Commission. I know what it’s like to live within government rules and constraints. I also know that you have choices – and in my view – you have not made those choices – you have only apologized for the constraints under which you tell us you must live. I have also lived through many electoral boundary changes but I can tell you that for the first time in 2018 – all our Scarborough electoral boundaries at all levels of government – for the first time in living memory – became the same. In Scarborough, we achieved a new level of electoral transparency and fairness that we had not seen before. Now your Commission is not only going to change boundaries within Scarborough – you are suggesting changes in Scarborough’s boundaries itself. And this after changing the electoral boundaries in 2013. Not only do these moves degrade our participation in democracy in Scarborough – they reduce Toronto’s participation overall. At the Scarborough Community Renewal Organization (SCRO), we do ‘get’ why you are proposing the changes. We understand the algorithm for change – we understand the movements in population – and we do understand the constraints you are under to propose the new boundaries and a reduction in seats. But whether other boundaries stay the same OR CHANGE, this creates either confusion or upheaval – take your choice.  If provincial and municipal boundaries change, there is more upheaval – if they stay the same, then the boundaries are out of sync. I don’t really need to review with you just how grotesque and damaging the changes you propose actually are so I will just touch on some highlights (paraphrased or quoted from recent media). Since 2011, the City of Toronto has grown by more than 179,000 residents. That’s more people than live in Prince Edward Island. The people of PEI are represented by four seats in the House of Commons, and they will still have four Members of Parliament in the next election. And despite adding more people than the population of PEI, Toronto is slated to lose a seat. Over the past decade, Ontario added almost two million people, or more than the combined populations of New Brunswick and Saskatchewan. For its nearly 1.2-million residents, Saskatchewan gets 14 seats – around 84,000 residents per riding. New Brunswick’s 789,225 people get 10 seats, or roughly 79,000 people per riding. In 2011, Ontario’s 12.9-million people were entitled to 121 seats, or roughly 106,000 people per riding. So, after growing by almost two-million people, how many new seats is Ontario getting? Just one. In written statements after releasing its proposal, the commission said it must reduce Toronto’s districts by one, but add two outside the city limits because of faster population growth in suburbs around Toronto. The commission had to propose many new boundaries “to correct wide variations in voter equality that have emerged across the province over the past decade,” Justice Lynne Leitch, its chairperson, said in an Aug. 19 release. With this proposed change, Scarborough-Agincourt is being broken up, redistributing a good part of our community into North York and deleting any reference to historical Agincourt in the process. Scarborough is losing an entire riding. This proposal takes out a good chunk of Scarborough North, and a sizable portion of Scarborough-Agincourt, and collapses our community into a new riding called Scarborough Northwest.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS The federal government offers support to businesses and individuals through multiple programs comprising the Canada COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. Some of these supports may be available to lawyers, law firms and other businesses offering legal services and are summarized below. For more detailed information, see Canada’s website Managing your Business during COVID-19. Also consider this guide, produced by Baker Tilly Canada, one of the country’s largest associations of chartered professional accounting firms, outlining financial relief measures available to businesses and individuals who are impacted economically by the COVID-19 outbreak. For applicable programs in each province and territory, see CBA Branch Resources. BUDGET 2021 Budget 2021 extends the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEW) until September 2021. It also proposes to gradually decrease the subsidy rate, beginning July 4, 2021, in order to ensure an orderly phase-out of the program as vaccinations are completed and the economy reopens. Budget 2021 also provides additional weeks of Recovery Benefits: Up to 12 additional weeks of Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) to a maximum of 50 weeks. The first four of these additional 12 weeks will be paid at $500 per week. As the economy reopens over the coming months, the remaining 8 weeks of this extension will be paid at a lower amount of $300 per week claimed. It extends the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) an additional 4 weeks, to a maximum of 42 weeks, at $500 per week, in the event that caregiving options, particularly for those supporting children, are not sufficiently available in the interim as the economy begins to safely reopen. PASSAGE OF EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE LEGISLATION AND COMING INTO EFFECT OF RECOVERY BENEFIT REGULATIONS Bill C-24, received Royal Assent on March 17, 2021. Workers claiming EI regular benefits can now access up to a maximum of 50 weeks for claims established between September 27, 2020 to September 25, 2021. In addition, self-employed workers who have opted in to the EI program to access special benefits are now able to use a 2020 earnings threshold of $5,000, compared to the previous threshold of $7,555. This change is retroactive for claims established as of January 3, 2021 and applies until September 25, 2021. In addition to Bill C-24, new regulations to increase the number of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Benefits have come into effect. This includes an increase in the number of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) by 12 weeks, extending the maximum duration of the benefits from 26 weeks to 38 weeks. It also includes an increase in the number of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Individuals can access these additional weeks through the Canada Revenue Agency beginning on March 18, 2021. Learn more about the legislative changes. CANADA REVENUE AGENCY (CRA) NEW PROCESS FOR SUBMITTING WAIVERS AND DISPOSITIONS With the outbreak of COVID-19, the Canada Revenue Agency is working hard to find ways to support taxpayers, adapt and simplify our processes, and make filing taxes less of a burden during these difficult times. One of our new processes allows for the online submission of: 1.	international waiver applications 2.	notifications of non-resident dispositions (under section 116 using the T2062 series of forms) This function is available through our secure portals: My Account, My Business Account, and Represent a Client. It’s secure and reliable, and it makes sending documents to the CRA easier and more efficient, particularly during a time when mail may be delayed.

About wildfire smoke events Smoke from wildfires in forests and grasslands can be a major source of air pollution for Canadians. Communities across Canada regularly experience wildfire smoke events. This is expected to continue as Canada is warming much faster than the rest of the world, providing ideal conditions for more frequent and longer wildfires. Wildfire season typically runs from early April to late October. As wildfires burn through forests and grasslands, they produce dense smoke. It is difficult to predict: 1.	when fires will occur 2.	how big they will be 3.	how much smoke they will generate 4.	what direction the smoke will travel Wildfire smoke may be carried hundreds or thousands of kilometres from the fire zone. This means smoke from other parts of the world can impact communities in Canada. Who is most at risk of the effects of wildfire smoke Some people are at higher risk of health problems when exposed to wildfire smoke. This includes: 1.	seniors 2.	pregnant people 3.	people who smoke 4.	infants and young children 5.	people who work outdoors 6.	people involved in strenuous outdoor exercise 7.	people with an existing illness or chronic health conditions, During heavy smoke conditions, everyone is at risk regardless of their age or health. Use care when spending time outdoors during a wildfire smoke event Check local air quality conditions to determine whether it’s safe to be outdoors. Pay attention to: 1.	the air quality health index (AQHI) 2.	special air quality statements 3.	other indicators of smoke levels in your community Limit outdoor activities and strenuous physical activities as much as possible. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms. Make sure the air in your home is clean Stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed. If it is too warm, turn on the air conditioning if possible.  If you do not have air conditioning and it is too warm to stay inside with the windows closed, seek out local cooling or clean air space. Use a portable air purifier in a room where you spend a lot of time. This can help decrease the fine particles from wildfire smoke in that room. Limit the use of exhaust fans when you’re not cooking. If you can’t maintain cool, clean air inside your home during a wildfire smoke event, be aware of locations in your community where you can find clean air and take a break from the smoke. Safe places that typically have air conditioning and filtered air include: 1.	libraries 2.	shopping malls 3.	community centres 4.	cleaner air shelters Contact your local health or emergency authorities to find the most up-to-date information about publicly accessible locations. It’s not unusual to feel anxious, stressed out, sad or isolated during a smoke event. Eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising indoors and staying in contact with friends can help. Anyone who is having trouble coping with symptoms of stress, anxiety or depression should seek help from a health care provider. Remember, a wildfire smoke event may last a long time, but it will eventually end. Sharing positive outlooks and attitudes will help you get through it. If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms. If smoke is present for more than a few days, stay active when you can. Try finding a place with clean air to exercise indoors, for instance at the gym, the community centre or at home. If you need to work outdoors, check with your provincial or territorial occupational health and safety organization or your local health authority. They can provide guidance on how to work safely outdoors during wildfire smoke events.

Introduction As barriers continue to rise, career aspirations dwindle and student debt increases, there is a pressing need to address the variety of challenges youth are facing in finding employment. While COVID-19 exacerbated many of these challenges, it also presented youth with more free time, which led to a rise in entrepreneurship. Youth are asking governments for help in growing their networks, finding entry-level opportunities, addressing their student debt and ensuring equitable opportunities for all. Barriers to employment Youth face many barriers that hinder their access to employment such as a lack of access to technology, professional networks and career development opportunities. Youth that come from low-income or marginalized communities are disproportionately impacted by these barriers. It is also problematic for youth who cannot find work in their official language of choice due to a lack of appropriate employment opportunities. “If you do not have a strong network its harder to have access to certain opportunities.” Career aspirations Youth expressed a need for stability, work-life balance and relevant work experiences. However, given how challenging it is to find an entry-level job, youth are not able to envision their potential career options. “If I wanted more of a casual job, I could probably get one. A career seems to be a whole different type of situation, just because I don’t actually have any college, job, or university experience.” Youth are choosing to delay graduation or pursue further schooling due to the increased stress of not being able to find employment. COVID-19 Due to COVID-19, job opportunities have become scarce and more competitive. As a result, youth expressed that they feel demotivated and stressed. In addition, the lack of social interaction is taking a mental toll on individuals. “Remote work removes the social outlet that many people used to have, and has taken a toll on people who have little social interaction.” As for positive impacts, the lack of employment opportunities led to an increase in entrepreneurship. Many youth found the motivation and capacity to start their own companies and initiatives. “I was looking for a job with young people right ahead of COVID-19. The opportunities were all cancelled – but I was able to build my company because of it.” Financial concerns Youth are struggling to pay the bills. The cost of post-secondary education continues to rise and entry-level salaries are not enough for youth to pay off their student loans. This financial stress takes a toll on youth and can make it difficult for them to excel in school. “The cost of post-secondary education compared to the wage received for those jobs is not aligned. My generation spent >$50,000 on post-secondary education with the promise of well-paying jobs. This is not the case and sets youth back in their ability to earn money, afford housing and take care of themselves financially.” Youth are missing out on career development opportunities that are volunteer and/or unpaid. “A lot of the job building opportunities aren’t paid, which prevents a lot of people from succeeding in their field.” Equity There are a disproportionate number of youth with disabilities who are unemployed. These youth are worried that a potential employer would not consider them as a viable candidate because they might be considered “expensive”. “Will employers see me as expensive in terms of my disability?” Youth from low-income communities aren’t able to build a strong network of professional connections which ultimately hampers their job opportunities. In addition, discrimination in the workplace leads to pay gaps and unequal opportunities. Conclusion Youth are facing a variety of challenges finding meaningful employment and there are significant inequities across different groups. Youth need continuous support from governments to attain entry-level jobs that provide opportunities for growth and career development. Youth need help building their professional networks, finding internships, developing 21st century skills and managing their finances. Governments should support programming that will help youth in these core areas, encourage entrepreneurship and identify the inequities in employment outcomes across different groups.

Introduction There are five main themes that surface on the topic of innovation, skills and learning: technology, education, equity, mental health, and skills. There are both positive and negative aspects to many of the factors examined. Each produces a recommendation to help youth have access to better resources and to learn in more stable environments. Technology Accessibility and the possibility of different educational settings via online engagement are important to youth. As it pertains to accessibility, the positives include not having to constantly move locations to meet other people or to take advantage of services, which uses more energy and resources. However, on the negative end of the spectrum, internet speed and the price of services can hinder work especially in rural and remote communities. When working from home, technology access and home environments could pose daunting hurdles. But on a more positive note, there could be a sense of greater autonomy and less social anxiety. Education Education is a big part of life for youth in Canada. Post-secondary education can give access to better income later in life. However, education is expensive and many youth leave school still feeling the need to be better prepared for the workforce; youth are seeking unique opportunities to learn more about who they are as individuals and ways to apply their unique interests or skillsets. Students who are active outside of school via community development initiatives and entrepreneurial pursuits have a harder time graduating within 4 years, or completing their education entirely. Students with disabilities often graduate later than their peers as well. For those who wish to study in French, access to francophone schools in official-language minority communities is more difficult and there are disparities between French and English programs. Programs like MitacsFootnote29 create pathways for post-secondary students to explore entrepreneurship and innovation, however, these are limited in impact because of scope. Undergraduate students from underrepresented communities want to have similar opportunities to gain hands-on experiences in entrepreneurship and innovation. Equity Access and quality of education is dependent upon location and wealth. Indigenous youth in particular have low rates of completing post-secondary education as a result of relevant ways of knowing and learning, transportation, and other support systems. Youth want to provide solutions to the problems our society faces today and we want to be a part of leading the change. Youth-led organizations must be seen as an asset and not a liability, they want an opportunity to contribute to “building back better” and they are seeking to be valued as part of the structural change needed to achieve equity. Finally, while COVID-19 has, in some ways, made education more accessible it has also made learning more difficult in other ways. Mental health Mental health has been greatly impacted by COVID-19 and education. COVID-19 has caused heavier workloads, and has not allowed for the prioritization of learning the skills necessary for a smooth adjustment to virtual learning. There have necessarily been fewer opportunities for social interactions, making it harder to make friends and nurture strong relationships. Some youth have been isolated with toxic family environments since they are no longer spending time at school. On the other hand, the pandemic has allowed some individuals to learn time management and self-discipline. Schools should prioritize mental health as the pressure to succeed and take the “right” courses are felt very strongly by many youth. Some youth report feeling pressured to attend postsecondary because society wants them to, despite not having a genuine interest. Having mental health issues distracts from the ability to develop the learning outcomes youth need to advance.

The Speech from the Throne opens every new session of Parliament. The Speech introduces the government’s direction and goals, and outlines how it will work to achieve them. The Senate and the House of Commons cannot conduct public business until Canada’s Head of State or their representative reads the Speech. Traditionally, the Governor General reads the Speech as The Queen’s representative in Canada. In 1957 and 1977, The Queen was in Canada and chose to read the Speech herself. It is called the Speech from the Throne because the Governor General reads the Speech from the seat—or the throne—in the Senate Chamber reserved for The Queen or her representative in Canada. Members of the House of Commons, senators, Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, and other invited guests attend the reading of the Speech. Role of the Governor General The Governor General has two essential functions in the opening of a new session of Parliament. On the advice of the Prime Minister, the Governor General summons Parliament through a proclamation. The Senate and the House of Commons do not have the authority to open a session of Parliament until the Governor General issues the proclamation. The Governor General also reads the Speech that is written by the government. The Governor General can add an introduction to the Speech that outlines their own activities. Role of the Usher of the Black Rod The Usher of the Black Rod is a senior parliamentary officer who is responsible for many aspects in the Senate Chamber. They are appointed by the Governor General at the recommendation of the Prime Minister, and have a number of ceremonial and security-related duties in support of the Senate. These duties include supporting the delivery of the Speech from the Throne, which is read in the Senate. Before the Governor General reads the Speech from the Throne, the Usher of the Black Rod leaves the Senate Chamber and knocks three times with the black rod on the doors of the House of Commons. This informs the Members of Parliament that the Governor General is calling them to come to the Senate Chamber. The position of the Usher of the Black Rod dates back to roughly 600 years ago in England. The original title used in Canada was “Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod” until 1997, when Mary C. McLaren became the first woman to hold the position. Since then, the title used in Canada has been gender-neutral. After the Speech from the Throne After the Governor General reads the Speech from the Throne, the new session of Parliament is officially open. Public business in both the Senate and the House of Commons can begin. The first order of business is for the Prime Minister to introduce Bill C-1 in the House of Commons. A senator also introduces a similar bill, Bill S-1, in the Senate. These bills show the House of Commons’ and Senate’s independence from the Crown and their right to meet and debate without having to follow the agenda presented in the Speech from the Throne. The bills are given first reading, but not second reading. After the first reading, the House of Commons and the Senate debate the Speech from the Throne.

Today, Microsoft is announcing new advances to Azure Quantum aimed at accelerating scientific discovery. From the Iron Age revolutionizing agriculture to the Silicon Age revolutionizing how we communicate, new materials have always created inflection points for societal progress. Advances in this space will be transformative. For example, the transportation industry can develop more efficient and powerful batteries.  Pharmaceutical researchers can develop new drugs. The chemistry industry will be able to discover safer and more sustainable compounds for the products we use daily, like electronics, paints and textiles. And most importantly, scientists will be able to solve society’s most pressing challenges like reversing climate change and addressing food insecurity. However, understanding nature is not an easy task. For accurate calculations of the most complex quantum states of molecules, the number of energy states of just 100 electrons can exceed the number of atoms in the visible universe. Now, with a new generation of AI, the world’s most advanced AI models are coming together with our universal user interface – natural language – and nature’s foundational language – chemistry – ushering in a new era of scientific discovery. And that’s just the first step as we prepare for an even bigger transformation ahead of us: quantum supercomputing. Innovators can start experimenting with the world’s best quantum hardware in Azure Quantum and get ready to solve more complex problems when quantum supercomputing becomes a reality. We are fast approaching the time when scientists and businesses will be able to solve previously intractable problems to unlock growth and human progress. Today, we are introducing three advances in Azure Quantum towards this vision. 1. Azure Quantum Elements Azure Quantum Elements accelerates scientific discovery by integrating the latest breakthroughs in high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence and quantum computing. With Azure Quantum Elements, scientists and product developers can: 1.	Reduce time to impact and costs by accelerating the R&D pipeline and bringing innovative products to market more quickly, with some customers seeing a six-month to one-week speed up from project kick-off to solution. 2.	Dramatically increase the search space for new materials, with the potential to scale from thousands of candidates to tens of millions. 3.	Speed up certain chemistry simulations by 500,000 times, which is like compressing a year into one minute. 4.	Get ready for scaled quantum computing by addressing quantum chemistry problems today with AI and HPC, while experimenting with existing quantum hardware and getting priority access to Microsoft’s quantum supercomputer in the future. Using this comprehensive system, researchers can make advances in chemistry and materials science with unprecedented scale, speed and accuracy. Scale. Scientists can understand the complex reactions needed to produce a product, find new candidates, and optimize the entire process. For example, scientists can now use Azure Quantum Elements to explore 1.5 million potential configurations in complex reactions comprised of 50,000 elementary steps. Early adopters are already using this massive scale to find more sustainable replacements for use in many everyday products, or entirely new products for innovative scenarios. Speed. Azure Quantum Elements accelerates simulation by incorporating Microsoft’s specialized AI models for chemistry, which we trained on millions of chemistry and materials data points.  We based these models on the same breakthrough technologies you see elsewhere with generative AI. While Copilot understands the language of humans, Azure Quantum Elements also understands the language of nature – chemistry. Accuracy. Today, scientists are using unique AI models and HPC scale to run simulations with higher levels of accuracy not available before. Azure Quantum Elements also integrates classical and quantum computing to provide an on-ramp to even greater simulation accuracy. In the future, scientists believe a quantum supercomputer will enable predictive chemical design at 100X accuracy.

This year we’re celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Global LGBTQIA+ Employees and Allies at Microsoft (GLEAM) employee resource group that is a driving force for LGBTQIA+ inclusion and Pride at Microsoft around the world. At a time when LGBTQIA+, transgender, non-binary, and gender-expansive communities need support, Microsoft invites everyone to keep and make more Pride by sharing stories, open-sourcing the entire Pride campaign design, contributing to LGBTQIA+ organizations, and creating a wide product release. Our efforts to support and advocate for LGBTQIA+ people do not start or end at Pride. By supporting our employees through global advocacy, charitable giving and better workplace practices, we hope to make a difference for LGBTQIA+ communities and beyond, as our drive for positive global impact continues. At a time when Pride is getting harder to organize and celebrate, we’re empowering organizers around the world by open-sourcing the entire Pride campaign design and inviting everyone to remix, share and make more Pride. We’re releasing campaign assets today on GitHub and adding ready-made templates to Clipchamp. Last year, we open-sourced our Pride flag design representing 40 LGBTQIA+ identities. Our flag update released today reflects almost 50 identities, expands representation of Asexual, Aromantic and Trans identities, and is available in new designs and sizes. Our Pride expression reflects on the open, inviting, grass-roots nature of Pride. Brush strokes, bright colors and a variety of flag combinations celebrate a community that’s wide, global, and ever-growing. Our Pride centers on simple truths about the LGBTQIA+ experience shared by employees around the world. Hugging your loved one is Pride. Openly serving your country is Pride. Mutual respect is Pride. And much more. By sharing their stories, LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft hope to invite everyone to make more Pride. Year-around, we recognize the many ways this diverse community continues to contribute and influence innovation at Microsoft and beyond. Join us in celebrating with powerful employee stories of strength, community, and leadership by visiting Inclusion Is Innovation. Last year, we made a statement of LGBTQIA+ visibility by releasing the Xbox Pride controller. This beloved and viral design is available year-round on Xbox Design Lab. This year, we’re taking it a step further. Xbox Game Studios Publishing is announcing a long-term partnership with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to increase LGBTQIA+ representation and storytelling in Xbox games. Through this partnership, we’re hoping to bring more LGBTQIA+ stories, characters and lived experiences to Xbox in ways that will resonate with gamers around the world. During June and beyond, Xbox is featuring a variety of game collections that showcase LGBTQIA+ creators, lead characters and games with inclusive gender and relationship options. These collections will exist year-round as part of our ongoing work to create more inclusive gaming ecosystems and elevate content that resonates with communities. This year, LGBTQIA+ communities at Microsoft invite everyone to join our live “Make Pride” event on YouTube to learn about the state of LGBTQIA+ rights from organizers, players, and advocates from LGBTQIA+ communities at Microsoft and beyond. Discover how we can bridge borders and bring about collective change for all. We hope you can join us on June 16 from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. PDT to watch the livestream. Microsoft introduced sexual orientation into our non-discrimination policies in 1989 – and we’ve been driving toward LGBTQIA+ inclusion ever since. In 1993, we began offering employee benefits for same-sex domestic partnerships, making us one of the first companies in the world to do so. We stood as a public supporter for marriage equality even before it became legal in the United States – and we continue to advocate for every type of family. Microsoft has attained a 100 score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for 17 years. Since its founding in 1993, GLEAM has honored Pride by lifting up LGBTQIA+ voices and used the reach of our products to share the messages of inclusion and support.

In March, we introduced the world to Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work. We’re excited to share the next step in our journey as we bring Copilot to more customers and introduce new capabilities. We’re also releasing new data and insights from our 2023 Work Trend Index on how work is changing in the era of AI. Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program Since March, we’ve been testing Copilot with 20 enterprise customers, learning alongside companies like Chevron, Goodyear, General Motors and Dow. Their overwhelming feedback is that Copilot has the potential to revolutionize work. They point to how it is a game changer for meetings and is beginning to transform the way they create. And, they’ve identified areas where we can do more to help people adapt to this new way of working, like the need for more conversational, multi-turn interactions. As we bring Copilot to more customers, we’ll continue to rely on this kind of feedback to refine Copilot and help guide users as they adapt to this new way of working. Today, we’re excited to announce the Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program, an invitation-only, paid preview that will roll out to an initial wave of 600 customers worldwide. And, to help every customer get AI-ready, we’ll also start rolling out Semantic Index for Copilot – a new capability in Microsoft 365 E3 and E5. Semantic Index for Copilot is a sophisticated map of your user and company data. For example, when you ask it about the “March Sales Report,” it doesn’t simply look for documents with those words in the file name or body. Instead, it understands that “sales reports are produced by Kelly on the finance team and created in Excel.” And it uses that conceptual understanding to determine your intent and help you find what you need. The Semantic Index for Copilot is critical to getting relevant, actionable responses to prompts in Microsoft 365 Copilot. And, it enhances enterprise search results for E3 and E5 customers – whether they are using Copilot or not. 2023 Work Trend Index The platform shift to AI is well underway. Just as customers turned to Microsoft to help them make the shift to remote and flexible work, they’re now turning to us to help them understand how this new era of AI will change work yet again. Our 2023 Annual Work Trend Index surveyed 31,000 people in 31 countries and analyzed trillions of aggregated productivity signals in Microsoft 365, along with labor market trends on LinkedIn to understand what the new era of AI means for work. The data paints a clear picture: The pace and volume of work has increased exponentially, and employees are struggling under the weight of work – putting innovation at risk. Leaders and employees alike are eager for AI to lift the burden. “This new generation of AI will remove the drudgery of work and unleash creativity,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “There’s an enormous opportunity for AI-powered tools to help alleviate digital debt, build AI aptitude, and empower employees.” The report unearthed three key insights business leaders need to know now, as they look to responsibly adopt AI: Digital debt costing us innovation We’re all carrying digital debt: The volume of data, emails and chats has outpaced our ability to process it all. Every minute spent managing this digital debt is a minute not spent on creative work. In a world where creativity is the new productivity, digital debt is more than an inconvenience – it’s impacting business. When 62% of employees report spending too much time searching for information, communicating and coordinating, they have less time for deep thinking, creating and social collaboration. Nearly two in three people say they don’t have enough time and energy to do their job. And those same employees are 3.5 times more likely to struggle with innovation and strategic thinking.

Space engages people of all ages by sparking curiosity of the unknown. With NASA’s progress toward its first lunar missions in more than 50 years, a new generation of Americans can witness the awe-inspiring power and joy of a moon landing. It can also inspire people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue space-related science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers, from astronauts to engineers and physicists to technicians. In recent years, we have witnessed significant diversity milestones in space exploration. Among these are the first all-female spacewalk and NASA’s diverse international crew of astronauts for the Artemis II lunar mission, where the first woman and first person of color will step foot on the moon. Although these achievements signal an important shift in the industry, women still represent only 20% of the space workforce. Black and Hispanic professionals remain underrepresented in STEM professions. Of the entire STEM workforce, a total of 24% are members of an underrepresented minority group. These statistics highlight the urgent need to continue expanding access to STEM education and the study of space — a core tenet of the Microsoft-NASA partnership that aims to address these inequities head on. Microsoft and NASA’s innovative partnership Critical to Microsoft and NASA’s more than two-decades of partnership is investing in the next generation by promoting STEM education across all communities. As part of this effort Microsoft is honored to collaborate with NASA to host our first Space Education Day — a showcase of students and educators across Washington, D.C. — on Tuesday, June 20 at Microsoft’s office in Arlington, Virginia. Space Education Day provides local students an opportunity to connect with Microsoft and NASA members during a day of innovative learning and technology demonstrations. We are thrilled to welcome students from the greater Washington, D.C region, home to a diverse pre-kindergarten through 12th grade population. There will be live demonstrations with the help of students who learned to program in the Minecraft Education portal, an immersive learning platform inspired by NASA’s Artemis Missions. Microsoft’s Minecraft Education recently partnered with NASA and the Challenge Center to equip students with future-ready skills for the next era of space exploration, and now students will have the opportunity to exercise these skills in real-time. “Our next generation of innovators need opportunities and resources that engage the Artemis Generation to reach for the moon and beyond,” said Mike Kincaid, associate administrator for NASA’s Office of STEM Engagement. “Investing in our students from all backgrounds today will build a diverse workforce that will ultimately achieve future breakthroughs in space.” Featured sessions at Space Education Day include: 1.	Microsoft Space Camps – Minecraft Artemis: Students will explore the lunar surface and learn about NASA’s Artemis program in a fun and immersive Minecraft environment. 2.	Azure Space Hackathon – College students will showcase their experience and technology using NASA satellite imagery and Microsoft’s AI capabilities and the Planetary Computer to find offshore windfarms around the world. 3.	NASA MSI Space Accelerators – Partners will discuss the goals and objectives of the NASA Space Accelerator program to connect minority-serving institutions to mentorship and funding opportunities from NASA and Microsoft. Space Education Day continues Microsoft and NASA’s efforts to develop high-impact initiatives and educational resources that promote STEM education for all. A student hackathon hosted last May by Azure Space and NASA called Coding for the Cosmos convened students from two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Washington, D.C. to establish new technologies, including deploying code to the International Space Station. Technology and the power of space can be used as a powerful tool to inspire, prepare and engage people of all ages and backgrounds, and Microsoft will continue to seek new opportunities to keep everyone reaching for the stars.

Toronto Public Health (TPH) has reported its first probable human case of West Nile virus (WNV) in an adult resident in 2023. WNV is an infection transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. While the risk of getting infected in Toronto is currently low, TPH encourages residents ahead of the August long weekend to take the following precautions to avoid bites from infected mosquitos: 1.	Wear light-coloured clothing, long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors. 2.	Apply insect repellent containing N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) or icaridin, following the manufacturer’s instructions. 3.	Take extra care during peak mosquito-biting hours, dusk and dawn, by using repellent and covering up. Make sure your home has tight-fitting screens on windows and doors. 4.	Remove standing water from properties where mosquitos can breed. Standing water includes any water that collects in items such as pool covers, buckets, planters, toys and garbage/recycling containers. WNV symptoms usually start to show between two and 14 days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, body aches, skin rash and swollen lymph glands. Older individuals or people with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of severe illness. Anyone concerned about any symptoms should contact their health care provider. TPH conducts mosquito surveillance and monitoring from mid-June until mid-September every year. Once a week, 22 mosquito traps are set across Toronto to collect mosquitos which are then submitted to a laboratory for identification and grouped by the lab into batches of mosquitos to test for WNV. So far in 2023, 20 batches – also known as pools – of mosquitos have been found to be positive for WNV. With the increased hot weather in Toronto lately, there is a higher risk of mosquitos that can transmit the virus once they are infected. In 2022, a total of 14 batches of mosquitos were confirmed as positive for the virus, in addition to 14 laboratory-confirmed human cases of WNV. More information about WNV and ways to reduce the risk of being infected with WNV is available on the City’s West Nile virus webpage. Quote: “While the risk of being infected with West Nile virus remains low in Toronto, now is a good time to remind residents ahead of the long weekend of the steps they can take to avoid bites from infected mosquitos when enjoying the beautiful summer weather. Apply insect repellent, wear light-coloured clothing, long pants, long-sleeved shirts and take extra care between dusk and dawn, which are peak mosquito-biting hours.” – Dr. Eileen de Villa, Medical Officer of Health Toronto is home to more than three million people whose diversity and experiences make this great city Canada’s leading economic engine and one of the world’s most diverse and livable cities. As the fourth largest city in North America, Toronto is a global leader in technology, finance, film, music, culture and innovation and climate action, and consistently places at the top of international rankings due to investments championed by its government, residents and businesses.

Today, the City of Toronto officially launched a new pilot program that allows residents and visitors 19 years of age and older to responsibly consume their own alcoholic beverages in 27 parks. The pilot will run until Monday, October 9. Councillor Shelley Carroll (Don Valley North), Chair of the Economic and Community Development Committee, and City staff were at Earlscourt Park this morning to officially introduce the new two-month pilot program. More information about the program, including park locations, regulations and restrictions, is available on the City’s Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage. In July, Toronto City Council approved the program to run in parks selected and confirmed in consultation with local Councillors. The item that Council considered is available on the City’s website. The pilot is based on public health guidance, public safety and operational considerations, as well as the experiences of other Canadian cities. Park users will be expected to know and follow all applicable bylaws and legislation in all parks including: 1.	Compliance with the provincial Liquor Licence and Control Act, 2019 which prohibits public intoxication and supplying/serving alcohol to people under 19 years old. 2.	Alcohol consumption is not permitted in non-pilot parks. 3.	A permit and licence are still required to sell or serve liquor in any park. 4.	Alcohol may not be consumed within the boundary of an outdoor swimming pool or deck; or within two metres of playgrounds, wading pools, splash pads or skateboard parks at the pilot program locations. The City is the first Ontario municipality to introduce a pilot program since the Province of Ontario authorized municipalities to designate public spaces for personal alcohol consumption. Examples of other Canadian jurisdictions that have implemented similar pilot programs include Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. The City will evaluate the impact of the pilot on park users and neighbouring communities through 311 reporting, on-site observations and results of an online public survey. Residents and visitors can access the survey on the City’s Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage.  Findings will be reported to Council in early 2024. As part of their regular duties during the pilot, bylaw enforcement officers regularly visit public parks to educate people about the rules and City bylaws and will continue to visit parks throughout Toronto. As always, the City will address park complaints and prioritize investigations into matters that pose risks to public use and nuisance control. The City will continue to work with Toronto Public Health to share information about safe alcohol consumption. Information on health risks associated with alcohol and safer drinking tips are available on the City’s Alcohol & Other Drugs webpage. Quote: “We’re glad to launch this sensible pilot and give residents the opportunity to drink responsibly in select public spaces. The City’s Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage, has all the details on the program, including the full list of participating parks, program guidelines and tips on safe drinking and harm reduction. This pilot will run until October 9, and I encourage everyone to share their feedback on the pilot through the online survey that is open now.” – Councillor Shelley Carroll (Don Valley North), Chair of the Infrastructure and Environment Committee Toronto is home to more than three million people whose diversity and experiences make this great city Canada’s leading economic engine and one of the world’s most diverse and livable cities. As the fourth largest city in North America, Toronto is a global leader in technology, finance, film, music, culture and innovation and climate action, and consistently places at the top of international rankings due to investments championed by its government, residents and businesses.

The City of Toronto is expanding eligibility for the Fair Pass Transit Discount Program to offer more affordable transit fares to 50,000 additional low-income Toronto residents. Under new eligibility criteria and effective today, the Fair Pass Program expansion prioritizes residents between 20 and 64 years old living in deep poverty, such as low-wage and part-time workers, newcomers and unemployed individuals receiving employment assistance. It also opens the program to residents who are on the waitlist for subsidized housing and child care, providing immediate financial help with their transit costs. The Fair Pass Program provides a 12-month discount on TTC travel, including Wheel-Trans. Currently, the program provides a 36 per cent discount on single adult fares (a single adult fare under Fair Pass is $2.10) and a 21 per cent discount on monthly passes (an adult monthly pass under Fair Pass is $123.25) by adding a discount code to the rider’s PRESTO card. The latest expansion marks the beginning of the program’s third phase, whereby any Toronto resident who meets the program’s age eligibility and low-income threshold can receive the discount. Based on the latest thresholds, a single individual with an after-tax income below $20,514 or a family of four with an income below $41,028 would be eligible for the discount. The income threshold for Fair Pass has been temporarily reduced to 75 per cent of the Low-Income Measure After-Tax (LIM-AT). This is expected to be a temporary income threshold reduction with the intention to return to the LIM-AT plus 15 per cent threshold originally set by the program as soon as possible. Fair Pass applicants who receive assistance through Ontario Works (OW), Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) or a Toronto Child Care Fee Subsidy can continue to provide their program identification number when applying. All other applicants must provide income documents to assess their financial eligibility. Residents can apply for the Fair Pass Program online or by calling 416-338-8888. To assist residents in acquiring a PRESTO card when applying for the Fair Pass Program, the City has partnered with Toronto Public Library’s (TPL) Complimentary PRESTO card initiative to distribute free PRESTO cards at participating TPL branches, while quantities last. A cornerstone initiative of the City’s Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Fair Pass Program was first approved by Toronto City Council in 2016 to make transit more affordable for low-income adult residents. More information about the City’s Poverty Reduction Strategy is available on the City’s webpage. This is the third time that Fair Pass has expanded program eligibility, which was designed to be phased and flexible. When the program launched phase one in 2018, OW and ODSP recipients were eligible. In 2019, the second phase was initiated when eligibility expanded to Toronto Children’s Services’ Child Care Fee Subsidy recipients and expanded again in 2022 to Rent-Geared-to-Income (RGI) subsidy recipients. The Fair Pass Transit Discount Program is a direct, targeted discount on TTC fares available to low-income working-age adults in Toronto. Low-income residents rely more on public transit to move around the city and the cost of travel should not act as a barrier to accessing critical services and supports such as education, employment, social and health services and good jobs outside of their immediate community. By providing residents with a transit discount, the Fair Pass Discount Program helps alleviate some of the daily financial burdens that low-income residents face. Toronto is home to more than three million people whose diversity and experiences make this great city Canada’s leading economic engine and one of the world’s most diverse and livable cities. As the fourth largest city in North America, Toronto is a global leader in technology, finance, film, music, culture and innovation and climate action, and consistently places at the top of international rankings due to investments championed by its government, residents and businesses.

The City of Toronto is sharing its latest update on encampments and homelessness. Using a Housing First approach, the City saw approximately 700 residents move from emergency shelters into permanent housing in May, more than any other month in the past two years. All Toronto shelters work from this Housing First approach to ensure that shelter service delivery is premised on the idea that stable housing is the primary need for individuals or families experiencing homelessness. The City is applying the learnings of the Dufferin Grove report to its encampment outreach work and Housing First approach to encourage people to move from encampments to the emergency shelter system and permanent supportive housing. The City is also committed to strengthening its Housing First approach to street and encampment outreach and providing wrap-around, client-centred case management supports to people living outdoors. The Dufferin Grove model Released in March this year, Toronto Ombudsman Kwame Addo’s report Investigation into the City’s Clearings of Encampments in 2021 contained 23 recommendations, which the City Manager agreed to implement. The Ombudsman’s report is available here. Among the recommendations was that the City release a report identifying key learnings from outreach efforts at Dufferin Grove Park. Today, the City released its report A Housing First approach for encampments: Findings from Dufferin Grove Park. The report, which examines an encampment outreach model implemented in Dufferin Grove Park between August and December 2021, is available on the City’s website  . The Dufferin Grove model enhanced existing outreach efforts at the park by having City staff work collaboratively with community partners at the advisory and operational levels, to bring comprehensive social and health service supports directly to the park to help reduce service barriers and promote client self-determination. An encampment prevention strategy helped ensure that no new encampments were added to the park so that outreach efforts could focus on better relationship building with known clients. As a result of the approach, 90 people at Dufferin Grove Park had successful outcomes including referrals to shelter programs, transitions to permanent housing or family reunification. A total of 101 tents or structures were removed, as all encampment occupants left the park with successful outcomes or moved voluntarily. Applying best practices The City is incorporating the learnings from its Dufferin Grove report into its approach as it considers best practices beyond the Dufferin Grove Park initiative. The key learnings have been critical to informing the City’s ongoing response to larger encampments and to successfully meeting the needs of people living within them. Best practices identified through the report are being used daily to inform approaches used by the City’s Streets to Homes and the Encampment Office to support outreach efforts at other encampments, as well as to inform the development and update of the City’s Interdepartmental Service Protocol for Homeless People Camping in Public Spaces. Unprecedented demand for shelter in Toronto Since 2016, the number of shelter spaces in Toronto has expanded by 125 per cent, from approximately 4,000 to 9,000 spaces needed daily. The City is providing more shelter beds per capita than any other municipality in Canada. Despite adding more than 1,000 shelter spaces last year, the system remains at capacity most nights. In 2023 outreach staff and community partners have seen 352 occupants successfully referred to the shelter system from encampments and 57 people from encampments moved into successful housing tenancies. To replicate the Dufferin Grove approach at other parks, there must be: 1.	Dedicated housing and shelter options available 2.	Dedicated staff from various City divisions, local community partners, resident groups and volunteers 3.	Onsite community supports to provide the critical services 4.	A park with a size and location that enables City staff and partners to co-locate an intensive level of resources

The City of Toronto responds to encampments by using the skill sets, tools, relationships and authorities of multiple City divisions and community partners to respond to the complex health and safety risks in and around encampments, facilitate access to safer inside spaces, removal of waste and debris, and ensure shared-use spaces are accessible to all. The City operates a system of more than 1,500 parks and ravines as shared recreational spaces for the benefit of the community. Outreach efforts at these locations focus on engaging with individuals living in encampments and other outdoor areas to build trusting relationships, and help address immediate health and safety needs and find permanent housing. Outreach staff visit various sites daily to work with encampment occupants on referrals to space in the shelter system and to connect them with a housing worker. This engagement process continues once a person accepts an inside space to help ensure they have ongoing support and access to services. The City’s Streets to Homes outreach team and partner agencies also conduct daily outreach on the streets to proactively connect with people living outdoors. Available 24 hours per day, seven days a week, year-round, they focus on establishing supportive relationships as a first step in addressing an individual’s immediate health and safety needs. They also provide supports to assist an individual in finding and then moving into shelter and housing. In 2022, there were approximately 1,277 referrals from Streets to Homes offering indoor space to those living outside and 1,112 of these Streets to Homes referrals were from encampments. The City cannot force people to come inside and use the many services offered in shelters but will continue to encourage people to take up offers of shelter and housing options. All members of the community are welcome to use the City’s parks and right-of-ways, so long as they abide by the terms of City Bylaws, but living in an encampment is in violation of the City Parks Bylaw and Streets and Sidewalks Bylaw. Any decision on trespass enforcement is initiated only after outreach and engagement efforts, including referrals to inside space, have been unsuccessful. The City is committed to making homelessness rare, brief and non-recurring – but it cannot do it alone. New and enhanced investments are urgently needed from the Government of Canada and Province of Ontario to complement City investments and increase the supply of deeply affordable rental housing with supports that include harm reduction and mental health supports. In addition to new housing supply and support services, investments in homelessness prevention programs and poverty reduction measures are necessary to prevent more households from falling into homelessness. The City added an additional $1 million in investment to its EPIC program (Eviction Prevention in Community) to enhance preventative measures, but more investment is needed from the City’s partners in other orders of government. All Toronto shelters work from this Housing First approach to ensure that shelter service delivery is premised on the idea that stable housing is the primary need for individuals or families experiencing homelessness. Last year alone the City helped more than 4,300 people move from the shelter system into permanent housing. The City’s shelter system has expanded from approximately 4,000 spaces in 2016 to around 9,000 beds today, offered at more than 100 locations across the city. The City has done the work with partners in other orders of government to get supportive housing built to help thousands of people move from shelters and into permanent housing. This year, 1,200 more supportive housing opportunities will become available for those experiencing homelessness. Since 2014, City spending on housing has increased by 124 per cent and the 2023 budget invests $618 million in direct support for housing initiatives – an increase of $341.9 million.

On October 4, 2022, the City of Toronto opened three designated Sacred Fire sites for First Nations, Inuit and Métis community members at the following parks: Allan Gardens, Christie Pits Park and Norwood Park. These sites were selected based on engagement with Indigenous community members and leaders, who identified a need for these sites in these areas. Additional sites are planned for the future. Since time immemorial, Indigenous Peoples have used Sacred Fires for wellness, healing and gatherings. Just as some people gather in churches, temples, mosques or synagogues, Indigenous ceremonies happen on the land. Fire is a sacred gift from the Creator, as well as a doorway of communication with the Spirit world, ancestors and Creation and is an important part of many ceremonies. The creation of designated Sacred Fire sites builds upon the work being done by the City with Indigenous community members to further enhance access to land for ceremony. In 2021, Toronto City Council approved City By-law amendments to create a new classification for fees associated with cultural fires, including Sacred Fires. This was brought forward by way of a Report for Action by Toronto Fire Services (TFS) in consultation with the Indigenous Affairs Office (IAO) and with Indigenous communities. By creating a category for open air burnings related to cultural or religious ceremonies or events, TFS is able to administer approvals as required under the Ontario Fire Code and ensure fire safety while recognizing the importance of Indigenous Sacred Fires in Indigenous culture, as well as the cultural and religious rights of other equity-seeking communities wishing to conduct an open-air burn as part of a cultural or religious practice, ceremony, or event. Designated Sacred Fires sites will be inspected by TFS once a year to ensure the safety of the sites, as required by the Ontario Fire Code. Indigenous community members may continue to hold Sacred Fires at undesignated sites by contacting the IAO or TFS, who will ensure staff are engaged to perform safety inspections. Each location has an Indigenous site facilitator from the community, who came together to serve as an advisory circle for the development of the Sacred Fire sites. They have met with City staff to select the locations, advised on what materials are needed on-site and help raise awareness of these sites in their communities. Site facilitators will be available to support community members as they begin to access the sites, and will continue as a circle to support ongoing engagement and refinement of the Sacred Fire process. Due to the spiritual nature of Sacred Fires, permission from the Elder or Fire Keeper is required to film or photograph any element of a ceremony. If showing footage of a Sacred Fire ceremony, it is good practice to indicate in the coverage that permission was granted by the Elder and/or Fire Keeper to capture and show the footage. The creation of designated Sacred Fire sites in City parks supports Action 15 of the City’s Reconciliation Action Plan, which addresses the need to reduce barriers for Indigenous People accessing Sacred Fires. These designated sites are also supported by articles in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Calls to Action in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report. Toronto is home to more than 2.9 million people whose diversity and experiences make this great city Canada’s leading economic engine and one of the world’s most diverse and livable cities. As the fourth largest city in North America, Toronto is a global leader in technology, finance, film, music, culture and innovation, and consistently places at the top of international rankings due to investments championed by its government, residents and businesses.

Apple today announced its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), a long-term global effort to advance equity and expand opportunities for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous communities, has more than doubled its initial financial commitment to total more than $200 million over the last three years. Since launching REJI in June 2020, Apple has supported education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform work across the U.S., with recent expansion to Australia, the U.K., and Mexico. Apple launched REJI at a pivotal moment in the U.S., as protests against racial injustice swept the nation. The initiative built upon the company’s years of work to create greater access to opportunity and advance equity for underserved groups, establishing a new entity dedicated to accelerating progress through deep engagements in schools and communities. “Building a more just and equitable world is urgent work that demands collaboration, commitment, and a common sense of purpose,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are proud to partner with many extraordinary organizations that are dedicated to addressing injustice and eliminating barriers to opportunity. And we’ll continue to lead with our values as we expand our efforts to create opportunities, lift up communities, and help build a better future for all.” Through REJI’s education grants, Apple has reached more than 160,000 learners through in-person courses and out-of-school offerings, while committing over $50 million to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to support science, technology, engineering, arts, and math opportunities. With a focus on economic empowerment, REJI funds financial institutions — including venture capital firms, Community Development Financial Institutions, and Minority Depository Institutions — that support Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous entrepreneurs and businesses. And REJI’s criminal justice reform grants have supported legal services, safe housing, identification services, healthcare access, and other vital reentry services for more than 19,000 justice-impacted individuals. “We launched REJI at a critical inflection point for our country,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We are resolved to keep building on the progress we’ve made to ensure equitable opportunity for Black and Brown communities across America and around the world.” New Partnership to Expand Access and Equity As part of its expanding work, today Apple announced a new partnership with the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance (MBKA), a program of the Obama Foundation. Through this strategic partnership and funding, Apple aims to help close opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of colour by supporting training for community leaders and MBKA staff, expanding programming for boys and young men of colour, and strengthening the MBKA network through targeted community impact microgrants. The program plans to train more than 500 leaders and engage over 50,000 youth across the U.S. “Apple’s continued support of the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance empowers the foundation to develop and implement new initiatives that create opportunities for our young people,” said Valerie Jarrett, the Obama Foundation’s CEO. “Together, we are building a more inclusive educational system that nurtures creativity, fosters innovation, and transforms the lives of boys and young men of colour across the country. We are grateful for their partnership and look forward to our continued collective efforts to ensure all youth can reach their full potential.” Increasing Investments in Minority Businesses Apple today committed an additional $25 million to Collab Capital, Harlem Capital, and VamosVentures — three venture capital funds working with minority-owned businesses. With this new round of investments, Apple has committed $50 million in venture capital support and more than $100 million in overall financing to mission-aligned diverse businesses and financial institutions. These investments are part of REJI’s economic empowerment pillar aimed at addressing systemic barriers to access, creating opportunity, and supplying funding to support underrepresented and underresourced communities and businesses of colour.

Inspired by a curiosity for the natural world, Deep Field is a new immersive art experience and app created by celebrated Australian artists and creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Edward Cutting of Tin&Ed, using iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. Initially available at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney and the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the interactive augmented reality (AR) and sonic experience enables students and families around the world to cocreate and connect in real time through their shared reimagining of the environment. Harnessing the power and portability of iPad Pro, combined with the precision of Apple Pencil to foster creativity, Deep Field participants are invited to take inspiration from works of art and the environment to draw their own flora and fauna, experimenting with vibrant colour, shapes, and textures. After dreaming up fantastical plant parts, participants sketch their designs with Apple Pencil in the Deep Field iPad app, which are then added to a global database filled with flora drawn by participants across the world in real time, cocreating a new ecosystem where the invisible worlds of plants are revealed through the magic of AR. Using the LiDAR Scanner on iPad Pro, participants watch their artworks bloom into spectacular 3D plant structures trailing across the floors, walls, and ceilings around them, creating a newly imagined, immersive natural world. The guided experience encourages audiences to consider new perspectives and think about the planet differently, from plants that have lived for a thousand years, to new and imagined species. Taking the experience to another level, the app’s UV mode also enables students and families to view their newly created world in a different dimension, as they experience the world as a pollinator. Multidisciplinary artists Tin&Ed create vibrant, playful, and interactive experiences across the world that explore and push the interconnected boundaries between art, design, and technology, and the physical and digital worlds. More than an immersive simulation, Deep Field utilizes accessible technology that empowers people to bring creativity to life, while also shining a spotlight on the need to protect the planet. To bring the Deep Field experience to life at this scale, Tin&Ed fused their background in art and design and passion for creative technologies to work skillfully across multiple devices. The power of MacBook Pro, Mac Studio with M1 Ultra, and Studio Display, combined with 3D platform Unity, enabled the development of complex three-dimensional worlds that were then optimized for real time. The Deep Field app was designed using Apple’s ARKit framework, allowing for the integration of the depth-sensing features in iPad Pro with the M2 chip, to produce spectacular 3D plant structures in AR. The state-of-the-art LiDAR Scanner in iPad Pro offers cutting-edge depth-sensing capabilities to measure light distance, and uses pixel depth information of a scene to deliver faster and more realistic AR experiences. “For us, AR is a powerful artistic medium for storytelling because it is immersive and multisensory,” says Tin Nguyen, artist at Tin&Ed. “The power of the M2 chip on iPad Pro has made it possible to create a work that enables children from across the globe to imagine new worlds together in real time.” “Deep Field encourages children to look, listen, and think more deeply about the natural world and their place within it,” says Edward Cutting, artist at Tin&Ed. “We hope they come away from the experience feeling a sense of wonder and curiosity and a deeper connection to nature and each other.” To enhance the multisensory experience, Deep Field features a multichannel soundscape of forgotten and extinct species by celebrated audio naturalist Martyn Stewart, bringing a new appreciation to the beauty of the noisy environment of the natural world. Stewart, together with his foundation, The Listening Planet, has made it his life’s work to catalog the sounds of the planet and bring nature’s voice to the world in the hopes of safeguarding its future.

Contact Posters will also be available for third-party calling apps. Live Voicemail gives users the ability to see real-time transcription as someone leaves a voicemail, and the opportunity to pick up while the caller is leaving their message. Calls identified as spam by carriers won’t appear as Live Voicemail, and will instead be instantly declined. With the power of the Neural Engine, Live Voicemail transcription is handled on-device and remains entirely private. FaceTime Adds Audio and Video Messages, Reactions, and Extends to Apple TV FaceTime now supports audio and video messages so when users call someone who is not available, they can share a message that can be enjoyed later. FaceTime calls also get more expressive with Reactions such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, laser beams, rain, and more. The new effects can be activated through simple gestures, and third-party video calling apps can take advantage of them as well. In an exciting update to Apple TV 4K, FaceTime now extends to the biggest screen in the home. Powered by Continuity Camera, users can initiate a video call directly from Apple TV, or start the call on iPhone and then hand it off to Apple TV, to see friends and family on their television. With Center Stage, users will have perfect framing even as they move around the room. A Fresh Look and Big Updates to Messages Messages gets significant updates with iOS 17, including an all-new stickers experience with new emoji stickers and the ability to create Live Stickers by lifting subjects from photos. Users can also add effects to Live Stickers that bring them to life, and a new drawer in the keyboard puts all of a user’s stickers in one place for easier access across iOS. Pause playback of video: Live Stickers in iOS 17 New Messages features enhance the way users communicate. An expandable menu that can be accessed with a simple tap to display iMessage apps gives Messages a sleeker look. Search gets more powerful and precise with search filters, making it possible for users to start a search and add additional filters to narrow down the results and find exactly what they are seeking. A new catch-up arrow indicates where the user last left off in the conversation, and replying inline is as simple as swiping on a text bubble. If a user shares their location, it will update in real time right in the conversation. When sending an audio message, it’s transcribed automatically so users can read it in the moment or listen later.

Apple today previewed watchOS 10, bringing Apple Watch users a fresh approach to quickly view information with redesigned apps, a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed, and delightful new watch faces. New metrics, Workout Views, and Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrive for cyclists, while new Compass Waypoints and Maps capabilities further help hikers. The Mindfulness app offers additional tools to support mental health. watchOS 10 is available as a developer beta today, and will be available as a free software update this fall. “watchOS is the world’s most advanced wearable operating system, and it has redefined how people all over the world think of what a watch can do,” said Kevin Lynch, Apple’s vice president of Technology. “watchOS 10 is a major milestone and an energizing new approach for Apple Watch, introducing a fresh new design for quickly viewing information, delightful new watch faces, new features for cyclists and hikers, and important tools for health.” New Design Language and Navigation With watchOS 10, redesigned apps provide more information at a glance, and there are new ways to navigate and quickly access content. “With watchOS 10, we’ve redesigned the interface, allowing users to experience Apple Watch like never before,” said Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design. “The update gives users the information that matters most to them at a glance, simplified navigation, and a new visual language that takes full advantage of the Apple Watch display. We’re also introducing the Smart Stack, offering quick access to proactive and relevant information, right from the watch face.” Pause playback of video: The Smart Stack Apple Watch apps, including Weather, Stocks, Home, Maps, Messages, World Clock, and others, now utilize more of the Apple Watch display for more glanceable information. The Activity app on Apple Watch and the Fitness app on iPhone make tracking daily movement even easier with more details, improvements to sharing, a redesigned trophy case, and Apple Fitness+ trainer tips. A new Smart Stack contains widgets that display timely information that adapts to the user’s context and can be revealed with a simple turn of the Digital Crown from any watch face. For example, at the beginning of the day, Weather will show the forecast, or, when traveling, the Smart Stack will show boarding passes from Wallet. Calendar and Reminders will reshuffle to the top to display upcoming meetings or tasks, and apps that are running, such as Podcasts, will also move up so they are readily available. Smart Stack also enables users to enjoy a beautiful watch face, like Portraits, while still offering a way to quickly access information they care about. Developers can also use the new design language to update their apps. For example, Streaks now utilizes the entire display to easily show progress and access tasks, the NBA app makes keeping up with a favourite team even more compelling with team colours and new game details, and with Waterllama’s redesign, users can quickly glance at their hydration from the last seven days with just a turn of the Digital Crown. Control Center is now accessible using the side button, making it easy to quickly open it at any time, over any app. A double-click of the Digital Crown reverts back to any apps used recently. New Watch Faces watchOS 10 introduces two new artistic and joyful watch faces: Palette and Snoopy. The Palette face depicts time in a wide variety of colours using three distinct overlapping layers, and as the time changes, the colours on the display also shift. Additionally, the beloved comic strip Peanuts comes to life on Apple Watch with a new watch face featuring Snoopy and Woodstock. The characters interact and play with the watch hands, react to the weather conditions in the area, or even get active when the user does a workout.

Apple today announced its latest privacy and security innovations, including major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety, and Lockdown Mode, as well as app privacy improvements. Additionally, Apple introduced new features designed with privacy and security at their core, including Check In, NameDrop, and Live Voicemail. These new efforts are the latest manifestation of Apple’s deeply held belief that privacy is a fundamental human right and that good privacy is built on a foundation of strong security. “Privacy is designed into every new Apple product and feature from the beginning,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “We are focused on keeping our users in the driver’s seat when it comes to their data by continuing to provide industry-leading privacy features and the best data security in the world. This approach is evident in a number of features on our platforms, like the major updates to Safari Private Browsing, as well as the expansion of Lockdown Mode.” Major Updates to Safari Private Browsing Safari introduced private browsing years before any other browser. This year, a significant update provides even greater protection against trackers as users browse the web and from people who might have access to their device. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections go even further to help prevent websites from using the latest techniques to track or identify a user’s device. Private Browsing now locks when not in use, allowing a user to keep tabs open even when stepping away from the device. Photos Privacy Permission Improvements A new embedded Photos picker can help users share specific photos with apps while keeping the rest of their library private. When apps ask to access the user’s entire photo library, the user will be shown more information about what they’ll be sharing, along with occasional reminders of their choice. Link Tracking Protection in Messages, Mail, and Safari Private Browsing Some websites add extra information to their URLs in order to track users across other websites. Now this information will be removed from the links users share in Messages and Mail, and the links will still work as expected. This information will also be removed from links in Safari Private Browsing. App Privacy Improvements New tools give developers more information about the data practices of third-party software development kits (SDKs) they use in their apps, allowing them to provide even more accurate Privacy Nutrition Labels. These changes also improve the integrity of the software supply chain by supporting signatures for third-party SDKs to add another layer of protection against abuse. Features Designed to Help Protect User Safety Communication Safety Communication Safety, designed to warn children when receiving or sending photos in Messages that contain nudity, now covers video content in addition to still images. A new API lets developers integrate Communication Safety right into their apps. Additionally, the feature will now help keep kids safe when they’re sending and receiving an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and when using the Phone app to receive a Contact Poster and the Photos picker to choose content to send. All image and video processing for Communication Safety occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content. These warnings will be turned on for the child accounts in their Family Sharing plan, and can be disabled by the parent. Sensitive Content Warning Sensitive Content Warning helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos when receiving them in Messages, an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and the Phone app when receiving a Contact Poster, all using the same privacy-preserving technology at the core of Communication Safety. The feature is optional and can be turned on by the user in Privacy & Security settings. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content.

Every year, as part of its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple issues a challenge to students across the globe: create an original app playground using the Swift coding language. This year, Apple increased the number of winners from the 350 awarded in previous years to 375 so even more students could be included in the event and recognized for their artistry and ingenuity. “We are amazed by the talent we see from the young developers who enter our Swift Student Challenge,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “This year’s submissions demonstrated not only the next generation’s commitment to building tools that will improve our lives, but also a willingness to embrace new technologies and tools, and deploy them in original and creative ways.” When WWDC23 kicks off June 5, the challenge winners will be among those attending virtually and in person to see the keynote, events, labs, and activities available this year to the global Apple developer community. Their app playgrounds represent more than 30 countries and regions, and cover topics as varied as healthcare, sports, entertainment, and the environment. But there is one thing all of the winners have in common: They are using coding to share their passions with the world. For first-time winners Asmi Jain, Yemi Agesin, and Marta Michelle Caliendo, coding is an opportunity not only to forge a unique career path, but also to help others along the way. While at Medi-Caps University in Indore, India, 20-year-old Asmi Jain found out her friend’s uncle had to undergo brain surgery. As a result, he was left with eye misalignment and facial paralysis. Jain sprung into action, designing her winning playground to track a user’s eye movements as they try to follow a ball moving around the screen. The playground’s purpose is to help strengthen the eye muscles, and though it was inspired by her friend’s uncle, Jain hopes it can be used by people with a variety of eye conditions and injuries. “It was important for me to create an app playground that could positively impact the lives of people like him,” says Jain. “My next goal is to get feedback and make sure it’s effective and user-friendly, and then release it on the App Store. Ultimately, I want to expand it so that it helps strengthen all of the muscles in the face, and I hope it can one day serve as a therapy tool that people like my friend’s uncle can use at their own pace.” Jain’s desire to use coding to solve problems in the healthcare sector springs from many years spent volunteering to help those around her. Recently, she and a few other students created a forum at her university so that their classmates had a support system for working through tough coding problems. “When you feel as though you’re part of something bigger, it motivates you and drives you to do better,” says Jain. “Coding lets me create things that help my friends and my community. And it gives me a sense of independence that is very empowering.” For many young people, moving to different countries while growing up would be a burden, but 21-year-old Yemi Agesin saw it as a blessing. His family lived in Germany, Nigeria, Belgium, and England before returning to the United States when he was a teenager. “You learn so much about the world when you move around,” says Agesin, who starts his final year at Kennesaw State University in Georgia this fall. “I think that really helps me because when I’m building things, I always try to consider and design for a wide range of perspectives.” Agesin’s winning app playground is a first-person baseball game that alludes to two of his passions: sports and filmmaking. They foreshadow not only the next few months — he’s currently writing a film about a baseball player that he will produce this summer — but also his future goals.

For more than 20 years, Google's products have improved the lives of people all over the world. Operating our business in an environmentally and socially responsible way has been a core value since our founding in 1998. Google has been carbon neutral since 2007 and we’ve matched our entire electricity consumption with renewables for the past three years. We continue to make major investments in affordable housing and have made a number of significant commitments to promote racial equity. Today, as part of a $10 billion debt offering, we have issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds, the largest sustainability or green bond by any company in history. Although a number of companies have issued green bonds (directed solely to environmental uses), sustainability bonds differ in that their proceeds support investment in both environmental and social initiatives. Such bonds are an emerging asset class and we hope this transaction will help develop this new market. We’re encouraged that there was such strong demand for these bonds from investors—they were significantly oversubscribed. The proceeds from these sustainability bonds will fund ongoing and new projects that are environmentally or socially responsible and enable investors to join us in tackling critical issues. We believe that these investments benefit our communities, employees and stakeholders, and are an important part of fulfilling Google’s  mission and goal of creating value over the long term. Consistent with the Green Bond Principles and the Social Bond Principles, eligible projects for use of proceeds are within the following eight areas that build on significant investments we have previously made and will not be allocated to any Google.org activities. For more than a decade, we’ve worked to make Google data centers some of the most efficient in the world by optimizing our use of energy, water, and materials. Today, on average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center. Compared with five years ago, we now deliver around seven times as much computing power with the same amount of electricity. Combating climate change requires transitioning to a clean energy economy. To date, we have committed approximately $4 billion to purchase clean energy from more than 50 wind and solar projects globally through 2034. Next, we are focused on our longer term vision to source carbon-free energy for our operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week; this means matching our energy consumption with clean energy for each of our data centers around the world on an hour-by-hour basis. Since the beginning, we've focused on the impact of our workplaces: from how we build our offices to preventing food waste in our cafes. Today, more than 13 million square feet of Google offices are LEED certified. We’re working to mitigate carbon emissions and take cars off the road by promoting the use of EVs and bicycles. By using Google shuttles in the Bay Area, we saved 40,000+ metric tons of CO2 emissions—equivalent to taking 8,760 cars off the road every work day. We are committed to maximizing the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same. To date, we’ve shipped millions of devices made with post-consumer recycled plastic and 100 percent of Nest products launched in 2019 include recycled plastics. We strive to be a good neighbor in the places we call home. To address the lack of affordable housing in the Bay Area, we made a $1 billion commitment to invest in housing and expect to help build 20,000 residential units, of which at least 5,000 will be affordable. COVID-19 has taken a devastating toll on many businesses. To help we made an $800+ million commitment to small- and medium-sized businesses, health organizations, governments, and health workers on the frontlines. We’ve also partnered with Opportunity Finance Network (OFN) to provide low-interest loans to community development financial institutions, who in turn provide loans to small businesses in underserved communities in the U.S., and are working with the American Library Association to create entrepreneurship centers across the U.S.

The web is an increasingly critical tool for news organizations, allowing them to communicate faster, research more easily, and disseminate their work to a global audience. Often it's the primary distribution channel for critical, investigative work that shines a light into the darkest corners of society and the economy—the kind of reporting that exposes wrongdoing, causes upset and brings about change. Unfortunately there are some out there who want to prevent this kind of reporting—to silence journalism when it’s needed most. A simple, inexpensive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack can be carried out by almost anyone with access to a computer—and take a site completely offline before its owners even know they’ve been attacked. These attacks threaten free expression and access to information—two of Google’s core values. So a few years ago we created Project Shield, an effort that uses Google’s security infrastructure to detect and filter attacks on news and human rights websites. Now we’re expanding Project Shield beyond our trusted testers, and opening it up to all the world’s news sites to protect them from DDoS attacks and eliminate DDoS as a form of censorship. We learned a lot from our early group of Project Shield testers. Not only have we kept websites online during attacks that otherwise would have taken them offline, we learned crucial information about how these types of attacks happen, and how we can improve our services to defend against them. With this expansion, tens of thousands of news sites will have access to Project Shield. And because Project Shield is free, even the smallest independent news organizations will be able to continue their important work without the fear of being shut down. Finally, Project Shield is not just about protecting journalism. It’s about improving the health of the Internet by mitigating against a significant threat for publishers and people who want to publish content that some might find inconvenient. A free and open Internet depends on protecting the free flow of information—starting with the news. Visit our website to learn how Project Shield works and, if you work in journalism, discover how you can join the fight to protect the world’s news.

For over 15 years, our focus has been to make YouTube the most rewarding place on the planet for creators. From educators, to comedians, to Minecraft gamers and everything in between, we’ve seen Canadian creators use YouTube to build successful digital businesses, and enrich Canada’s culture along the way. Today Oxford Economics released a new report that assessed the economic, societal, and cultural contributions of YouTube in Canada in 2022. The report found that YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed more than $2.0 billion CAD to Canada’s GDP in 2022, and supported more than 35,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs. Cassandra is one of the many Canadian creators who have harnessed the power of YouTube to build a thriving community and business with her channel Clutterbug (780K subscribers, 94M+ views). As a mother of three, she often struggled with a messy, cluttered home. After finally discovering the methods of home management that worked for her, she was determined to share her organization tips and tricks. Encouraged by a camera she received as a gift from her husband, Cassandra uploaded her first YouTube video a decade ago hoping to discover business opportunities and connect with potential customers. Fast forward to today, and Cassandra has four best-selling books, a podcast, and an HGTV show called “Hot Mess House.” Her favourite part of being a creator is the participatory experience with her community. She constantly hears from viewers how she’s helped them improve their homes, lives, and even relationships by implementing her cleaning philosophy. Beyond economic impact, Canadian creators also shape society and offer a place to learn. Steph & Den noticed that few creators in the personal finance education space reflected their personal experience when making daily financial decisions. They decided to start a channel (89K subscribers, 17M+ views) to share their experiences, and as they explored the basics of investing, debt, and how money systems work, their audience began to grow. They hope to continue to help demystify finance for their community on YouTube. 1 in 3 creators in Canada who earn money from YouTube agree that YouTube is their primary source of revenue. Many creators also help broaden people’s perspective on a broad range of topics. Not only can creators from all walks of life use YouTube to share their culture with the world, but Canadian viewers get to learn about other cultures. Bilal started posting content on his YouTube channel GoldenGully (4.06M+ subscribers, 3B+ views) to share his family recipes and his love of Pakistani food and flavours. As his channel grew, he saw more people find commonality than difference in his content. Viewers from Canada, Germany, Iran and Mexico share stories in the comments about the similarities to Pakistani cuisine in their own family’s recipes. Bilal credits access to a global platform in helping him share his passion with the world. 79% of Canadian users agree that with YouTube they can hear from diverse communities and/or cultures from around the world. This Oxford Economics report reinforces what we’re seeing across the country: Canadian Creators are proven hitmakers. They are this and the next generation of CEOs, directors, writers, producers, editors, marketers, and talent. These incredible, diverse storytellers continue to thrive on YouTube, shape culture, and have a positive impact in Canada. Visit yt.be/impact to explore Canada’s creator economy and meet more of the Canadian creators behind the numbers.

YouTube creators are proven hitmakers. They are this generation’s directors, producers, writers and talent. And in Canada, local creators continue to punch above their weight, winning the hearts of Canadian and global audiences. According to new research from Oxford Economics, YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed over $2.0 billion CAD to Canada’s GDP in 2022, and supported 35,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs. In a world where Canadians can watch anything, they consistently choose to spend time on YouTube with the creators and content they love most. What this translates to, is an engaged audience of millions, making YouTube the place to be for creators, viewers and advertisers. According to Comscore, YouTube reaches 98% of Canadians across all audiences, making it the #1 ad-supported video platform in Canada. And where Canadians watch is as important as what they’re watching. We're seeing Canadians stream YouTube on their TV screens more than ever before with the rise of Connected TV (CTV). The ‘big screen’ in the living room has become the go to choice for Canadians. In December 2022, over 17M people streamed YouTube on their TV in Canada, and CTV remains the fastest growing platform for YouTube for the last five years. As the living room revolution continues, we have solutions that can help advertisers find hard to reach audiences on the big screen. With YouTube on CTV, brands can have the best of both worlds: the big screen impact of TV with the precision and control of digital. YouTube brings together the power of reach, relevance and the world’s most connected ad ecosystem so advertisers can drive better results and realize the full impact of their media spend in one place. As more people watch YouTube, here’s how we’re making it easier for advertisers to connect with their customers on any screen. 1.	Brands can reach customers they can’t find anywhere else, with solutions like YouTube Select lineups, inclusive of the most popular content watched on the TV from top creators, live sports, shows and music. 2.	We’ve been known for years for our exclusive YouTube Masthead opportunity, and now we’re offering more ways to capture an audience’s attention with this format. To help brands show up during big moments like a new movie release or a product launch, we recently launched a Cost-Per-Hour Masthead. This new way to buy YouTube’s most prominent placement gives advertisers exclusive ownership of the Masthead during the hour(s) leading up to, during or after priority moments. 3.	And we can’t forget the other video format that’s booming - short-form. YouTube Shorts is now averaging over 50 billion daily views It’s become a rich canvas for every type of content people care about: music, gaming, sports, lifestyle, learning, food. Since launching ads on Shorts last year, brands have found many ways to drive performance in their direct-response campaigns. Through Video action campaigns and app campaigns, vertical video ads are fully immersive and appear between organic Shorts content. These campaigns are currently driven with AI to help brands easily develop the right creative, and we’ll continue to use AI to ensure partners reach the right audiences. 4.	We’re also bringing 30 second non-skips to YouTube Select on CTV. We know that running longer-form creative on the big screen aligns with advertiser objectives, and allows for richer storytelling. This format seamlessly fits into what viewers already expect and experience on the big screen. Instead of seeing two :15 ads consecutively, they'll see one :30 ad. 5.	We’ve also made the user experience more helpful for viewers and advertisers by creating an interactive and seamless experience across screens. For viewers watching on the big screen, Brand extensions have allowed viewers to learn more about a product with one click of a button, without interrupting their viewing experience.

From connecting with friends and family to learning a new hobby, Canadians are active online in many ways. And since many families spend a lot of that time on Google platforms and devices, we’re committed to investing in protections, privacy features and easy-to-use content controls that help families learn, play and explore safely across digital spaces. Today we’re reminding Canadians of several resources, tips and safety features from Google and YouTube that are available for families to manage their digital experience and adopt smarter, safer online habits. At YouTube, a core part of fulfilling this responsibility is quickly removing content that violates our Community Guidelines, using a combination of machine learning and human reviewers. Our policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links and thumbnails, enforced consistently across language, perspectives and speakers. This month we released our Q4 Community Guidelines Enforcement report, demonstrating that YouTube removed over 5.6 million videos for violating our Community Guidelines. Of these videos, more than 94% were first flagged by our automated systems, and over 71% of these were removed before receiving more than 10 views.1 Our quarterly report is one of the ways we’re committed to providing transparency about how we keep our platform and community safe. But we know that Canadians continue to search for tips and support for how to keep their families safe online. Tools to manage your digital experience 1.	YouTube Kids: We built YouTube Kids2 to create a safer environment for kids under the age of 13 to pursue their interests and curiosity. It provides extensive filters for an age-appropriate experience, along with various parental controls and settings to further customize the experience, including bedtime reminders, time watched and controls to tailor autoplay or search. You can also set an in-app timer to limit your child’s screen time. Parents should routinely check their family settings to ensure that they continue to meet their needs. 2.	YouTube Supervised accounts: Supervised experiences2 is a new option on YouTube, where parents and caregivers have parental options and controls to determine which online experience is best for their family. Our supervised experience on YouTube works well for families with tweens and teens who have their own mobile devices or want their own accounts. We spent the last year expanding support for these supervised accounts so that tweens can sign in to YouTube on gaming consoles, smart TVs, the YouTube Music app and more. This helps to respect a parent's choice for content settings across devices in the home where their tween watches videos or listens to music. 3.	Google Search: Users can enable SafeSearch on Google which helps filter out explicit content – in the coming months a new function will automatically blur out explicit search results for all 18+ and signed-out users. 4.	Family Link: The parental tools app Family Link2 helps parents instill healthy digital habits in their kids, providing visibility on how a child is spending time on their device. Parents can keep an eye on screen time, set a bedtime for their child’s device and apply content restrictions. Protect your family’s information and data privacy Online safety also means keeping your family’s personal information and online activity secure. Helping people stay safe online is our top priority. That’s why we design our products with built-in protections and invest in global teams and operations to prevent abuse on our platforms. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in cybersecurity threats, especially for individuals and groups that tend to be at higher risk for online attacks, such as activists, journalists, election and campaign officials, and people working in public life. To help anyone at risk, we’ve made our strongest security protections easily accessible. Here are more details about the best tools, tips, and resources people can use to protect themselves online.

Good morning. My name is Sabrina Geremia and I’m Vice President and Head of Google in Canada. I’m joined today by Jason Kee, a subject matter expert on Search, News and Ads. This committee’s work is important and we have made it a priority to be available today to answer your questions about our approach to Bill C-18 and our news product tests. Google has proudly been in Canada for more than 20 years, with offices in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, and Waterloo; a Canadian center of engineering excellence; and remote colleagues across the country. Throughout that time, we’ve invested in Canadian communities because they’re our communities, too. Google collaborates closely with the news industry. Through our programs, products, and partnerships, we’re one of the world’s biggest financial supporters of journalism, delivering significant value and funding for news organizations in Canada and around the world. In the last year alone, we linked to Canadian news publishers more than 3.6 billion times - at no charge - helping them make money with ads and new subscriptions. This free traffic from links drove an estimated $250 million worth of value to Canadian publishers. We also pay news publishers to license content through Google News Showcase. In Canada, we have paid agreements that support more than 150 publications across the country, in both official languages. These agreements help support Canadian newsrooms, large and small, that provide comprehensive general-interest and local news to the communities they serve. Our partners include Le Devoir, Cn2i, Torstar, The Globe and Mail, Black Press Media, Métro Média, Postmedia, Village Media, and many more. Innovation is central to the future of news. Through the Google News Initiative, we provide tools, training, and funding to support Canadian news organizations, independent journalists and journalism students to adapt, innovate and thrive. In June 2021, we made a three year commitment to train 5,000 Canadian journalists and journalism students on strengthening digital skills in newsrooms. Last year alone, we trained more than 1,500 Canadian journalists from newsrooms big and small, including students, independent journalists, and journalists that serve underrepresented communities. We share the government’s goal of promoting a healthy, innovative, and diverse news ecosystem for the digital age. We have worked constructively and been transparent throughout this process about our concerns with C-18. We have sought to work with parliamentarians to improve the bill and offered reasonable and balanced solutions. This bill has some very serious problems. Putting a price on free links to webpages, as C-18 does, sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the very foundations of the open web and the free flow of information. It also incentivizes the creation of cheap, clickbait content over quality journalism. C-18 was intended to incentivize platforms, like Google, to enter voluntary agreements with news publishers that would support Canadian's access to news. But the exemption and eligibility criteria have shifted so significantly that it would require subsidies for media companies even if they don't produce news, even if they’re not online, and regardless of whether we link to their content. There is no clearly defined commitment to a code of ethics for eligibility, which threatens the standards of journalism in Canada. Unreasonable timelines and unfair arbitration provisions have been added that ensure any reasonable offer from platforms would be rejected, creating a framework for bad faith bargaining. Instead of being focused on supporting local journalism, C-18 would subsidize large legacy organizations and broadcasters, and will hurt emerging and innovative organizations that are providing quality local news in communities across Canada. This bill is no longer about supporting journalism. Under C-18, platforms would be subject to uncapped financial liability merely for providing free links to the news Canadians are searching for. All Canadians should be concerned about the potential for negative impacts on how they find and share news online. As the bill has worsened through each step of the process, we've had to consider what product changes it may require. And potential product changes need to be tested.

More people are turning to the web to find their next car. In fact, based on our 2022 Kantar Think Auto Research, 8 in 10 Canadians rely on online search during the car buying process to inform their purchase decision. And shoppers aren't just looking up information online — they’re purchasing there, too. Online car sales increased by 600% over COVID-19 with 6% of Canadian shoppers purchasing a vehicle completely online. Shoppers today expect an easy and helpful experience when they search for what to buy. It’s important for auto advertisers to get in front of car shoppers with the right information and inventory. Introducing vehicle ads Today we’re announcing vehicle ads, a new ad format that shows cars for sale in Canada. Vehicle ads can help you easily reach customers looking for a new ride. For example, if someone searches for a 2023 SUV, they’ll see several vehicle options they can either purchase nearby or get delivered — along with pictures and inventory information like location, make, model, price and mileage. Once they select a car, the ad will direct them to the vehicle description page on your website where they can fill out a lead form or get your dealership’s contact information. You can then select which actions you’d like to measure, like leads and store visits, and assign a value to them. To get started, you’ll need to create a vehicle inventory data feed and connect it to Google Merchant Center. This feed contains all the details about your vehicle inventory, like make, model, price, mileage and condition. Google uses those details to match shoppers with the most relevant cars as they’re searching. Plus, you can keep track of key inventory and ad performance insights. Advertisers who complemented their existing Search campaigns with vehicle ads saw a +25% average increase in conversions during beta testing. Let’s take a closer look at some businesses who recently gave vehicle ads a spin. Hamel Honda was looking for a new way to reach customers with the right vehicle inventory at the right time. They implemented a vehicle ads campaign with the help of 360 Agency and the Google team to push the dealership’s used inventory in real time. Adding vehicle ads into their media plan alongside their Search campaigns resulted in a 27% increase in leads for used vehicles, decreased the cost per acquisition by 18% and increased the conversion rate by 17%. Asbury Automotive Group needed a solution to meet the demand of shoppers searching for cars online. The team created a vehicle feed — a listing of all their inventory with descriptive attributes, like make and model, and the dealerships where they’re located. After creating that feed, they used vehicle ads to promote their used car inventory on Search. As a result, Asbury drove a 35% increase in conversions and a 12% increase in conversion value.

Hi everyone, Over the past several weeks, violent and racist attacks against the Black community have forced the world to reckon with the structural and systemic racism that Black people have experienced over generations. My own search for answers started within our own walls. Listening to the personal accounts of members of our Black Leadership Advisory Group and our Black+ Googlers has only reinforced for me the reality our Black communities face: one where systemic racism permeates every aspect of life, from interactions with law enforcement, to access to housing and capital, to health care, education, and the workplace. As a company, and as individuals who came here to build helpful products for everyone, Google commits to translating the energy of this moment into lasting, meaningful change. Today we are announcing a set of concrete commitments to move that work forward: internally, to build sustainable equity for Google’s Black+ community, and externally, to make our products and programs helpful in the moments that matter most to Black users. Building sustainable equity Creating meaningful change starts within our own company. Strengthening our commitment to racial equity and inclusion will help Google build more helpful products for our users and the world. To that end, we’re announcing several commitments to build sustainable equity for our Black+ community. First, we’re working to improve Black+ representation at senior levels and committing to a goal to improve leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30 percent by 2025. To help achieve this, we’ll post senior leadership roles externally as well as internally, and increase our investments in places such as Atlanta, Washington DC, Chicago, and London, where we already have offices. We'll take the same approach across regions, using site and country-specific plans to recruit and hire more underrepresented Googlers in communities where the social infrastructure already supports a sense of belonging and contributes to a better quality of life. Second, we’ll do more to address representation challenges and focus on hiring, retention, and promotion at all levels. To help direct that work, I’m establishing a new talent liaison within each product and functional area to mentor and advocate for the progression and retention of Googlers from underrepresented groups. I’m also convening a task force, including senior members of the Black+ community at Google, to develop concrete recommendations and proposals for accountability across all of the areas that affect the Black+ Googler experience, from recruiting and hiring, to performance management, to career progression and retention. I’ve asked the task force to come back with specific proposals (including measurable goals) within 90 days. Third, we’re working to create a stronger sense of inclusion and belonging for Googlers in general and our Black+ community in particular. Our internal research shows that feelings of belonging are driven by many aspects of our experiences at work, including the psychological safety we feel among our teams, the support of our managers and leaders, equitable people processes, and opportunities to grow and develop our careers. Across all of these dimensions, we’re committed to building more inclusive practices and policies—and revisiting them when we don’t get them right. As one example, we’ve had a security practice of Googlers watching for “tailgaters” in order to reduce instances of unauthorized visitors in offices. We have realized this process is susceptible to bias. So, over the past year, our Global Security and Resilience team partnering with a cross-functional working group, conducted extensive research, listened to Black Googlers’ experiences, and developed and tested new security procedures to ensure we could maintain the safety and security of the Google community without relying on this type of enforcement. Now, as we prepare to return to the office, we will end the practice of Googlers badge-checking each other and rely on our already robust security infrastructure.

In water-scarce regions like California, every last drop counts. Yet millions of gallons of water are lost every year to a common, yet easily preventable, cause of water waste: leaky toilets. That's why we recently co-funded a pilot project to install water-saving technology in three multi-family buildings in Los Angeles. The tech takes aim at common leaks, like toilets that keep running water when not in use, which can add up over time. The pilot is on track to save 6.4 million gallons of water a year in the L.A. watershed where we operate, supporting our commitment to replenish 120% of the water we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030. The pilot came together with partners from the California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC), a water stewardship network of over 25 organizations — including private companies like Google alongside environmental NGOs and nonprofits — that are committed to improving water security across the state. Here's a look at how this project is saving water, money and energy, and at the potential for collective action models to make meaningful progress on rising water challenges. Saving water, money and energy The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power estimates that the average household loses up to 10,000 gallons of water every year to leaky toilets that go unnoticed. The good news is that while leaky toilets can be hard to detect, they’re easy to fix. For the pilot project, CWAC members Pacific Institute and Bonneville Environmental Foundation tackled this challenge in three low-income multi-family housing buildings operated by nonprofit organizations, working alongside the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and other local water utilities. Toilets in these buildings were equipped with small, low-cost, low-power sensors developed by Sensor Industries. When a toilet leaks, the sensors alert building management in real time that a toilet needs to be repaired. The fix is usually as simple as readjusting or replacing the toilet flapper. This simple intervention resulted in serious savings of water, money and energy, according to estimates from the nonprofit Pacific Institute: 1.	Water: The pilots are reducing building water use by an estimated 15% to 25%. The expected savings of 6.4 million gallons of water per year is equivalent to the total annual water use of about 40 single-family homes. Those savings extend to other customers who get their water from the same public utility, reducing water demand — and improving water reliability and affordability — across the system. 2.	Cost: The water savings translate into cost savings on water and wastewater bills of the same 15% to 25%, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars a year. The nonprofit building operators who pay the water bills could use these savings to make building improvements, in effect passing the savings along to residents. 3.	Energy: Southern California imports much of its water from hundreds of miles away, and it takes a lot of energy to pump this water over the mountains surrounding the L.A. Basin and treat it for household use. By reducing the demand for that water, the project cuts back on the energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions embedded in the water system. Pacific Institute points to several other advantages of this approach. Residents don’t have to do anything — the non-invasive system detects problems and notifies the building. Facility managers can see the likely reason for the leak (such as a stuck flapper), which helps them fix it faster. The nonprofit building operators can focus on more urgent issues and reduce time spent tracking down leaks.

Starting the new school year is an exciting time for both students, faculty, and staff but it can also come with a long list of to dos leading up to that first day. Teachers are tasked with creating a positive learning environment, stocking the classroom, and preparing lessons. At the same time, institutions and procurement teams are challenged to manage budgets and approve faculty and staff purchases. There’s a lot that goes into ensuring it’s a smooth first day for students. From early childhood to K-12 to higher education, Amazon Business simplifies the buying process for both educators and administrators. Serving 80% of the 100 largest education organizations in the U.S., we’ve created unique savings opportunities and software solutions with you in mind. Here’s how you can drive value, boost buyer compliance, and allow your educators to get what they need just in time for the new school year. Empower educators to get what they need while ensuring purchases are compliant Amazon Business account administrators can define different types of buying policies. Meaning, you can identify preferred products or sellers and support businesses in your local community, buy from minority-owned entities, and champion sustainability initiatives. Even more, account administrators can block restricted sellers or categories, and define spending limits for teachers, faculty, and staff using Buying Policies and Approvals. With Buying Policies and Approvals, you can assign approvers for each policy created. So when it comes time for an educator to purchase items that require approvals, the process automatically kicks in—saving time for both procurement teams and buyers. Not to mention, only necessary purchases identified in the policy are escalated, which frees up time for you and approvers to focus on high-value activities. School funding is often spent on a first-come-first-serve funding basis, which results in educators frontloading requests at the beginning of school year due to the fear of losing funds entirely. With Amazon Business’ Budget Management tool, were helping account administrators allocate time-bound funds to educators. Helping educators know their balance and when they need to spend it. It’s no secret that the key to any successful classroom is building a positive learning environment where all students thrive. It’s never too early to start buying materials for specific lesson plans, but at the very least, you should restock basic supplies that educators and students will need on a daily basis. To make buying from Amazon Business even more convenient, we’ve created a dedicated Back to School storefront offering staff and teachers Educator Pricing across a comprehensive selection of products educators need to kick-off the year. Discover low prices and curated supplies by age group and view popular products that have been purchased by other educators. Educators can easily shop for books, everyday school supplies, electronics, classroom and furniture organization, educational actives and STEM, sanitation and wellness, and more all on Amazon Business. Need to buy in higher quantities? Educators can take savings a step further with Quantity Discounts, offering a selection of over 60 million eligible items. These discounts apply when they buy at least two of the same item at the same time. Even more, using Custom Quote buyers can request a discounted price on high volume purchases that are either more than $10,000 or over 999 units. Once the request has been submitted, sellers can reply with an offer and buyers can then decide to place their order for purchase. To keep your classroom stocked year-round, we recommend using Business Lists to replenish commonly purchased items such as paper, pens, post-it notes, dry-erase markers, and more. Educators can use Business Lists to create a catalog of their repeat items helping to streamline buying and save time searching and shopping. Once a buyer creates a list, they can reorder from the entire list or order individual items from that list at any time and in different quantities. Each buyer can make their own unique list that suits their needs and even share their lists among other buyers.

Our work is a truly global affair. It’s about celebrating the Spotify app, our playlists, our creators and most of all: our people. The Spotifiers themselves, and the work each person does on a day-to-day basis, are what makes Spotify a great place to work. That’s why we make sure to create the time and space for everyone to come together, connect and celebrate. We focus on creating the right atmosphere for our audience to feel free to be in the moment entirely and fully submerge themselves in the experience created. Top that up with moments of building connections, community and it sets the stage for magical moments to be imprinted in their Spotify memory banks. This year, we have another achievement to celebrate. At our flagship event in Stockholm, we also, very consciously, focused on sustainability. And we’re proud to have been granted the Greentime Sustainable Event certification. Sustainability In Employer Branding Visibly demonstrating purpose through sustainability actions is another extremely powerful way to connect our employees’ personal values to the company’s cultural values. Many employees look for confirmation that they’ve joined a company which respects its responsibilities and will follow through on its promises. Therefore, an organisation’s sustainability strategy and subsequent actions are a major deciding factor when choosing to join a company, or even to stay with an employer. Spotify is one of many organisations that have committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. To achieve this, we need to look at all parts of our business, including our CommunityX events. We followed Greentime’s planning tool during the production of SpotiFEST Stockholm and chose to target improvements to the areas where we could have the biggest impact. Therefore, we made changes in the event production and at the event itself, which reduced our carbon emissions and encouraged social change. Sustainable Event Production Here are the areas we zoomed in on: Location & Venue To have the right conditions for producing a sustainable event we chose a location that has event-infrastructure such as electricity, water, wi-fi, toilettes, weather proofing etc. ready to use. To start from this basis instead of building everything up from scratch on a field makes a huge impact both from an ecological, economic, and social perspective. Travel & Transports The event site we chose was accessible with public transportation, which lowered our CO2 emissions as well as saving money and time for our Spotifiers. Making this venue and location choice also minimised the need for transport for catering since most of the food could come from local restaurants in the area. Food, Beverage & Packaging To lower the CO2 emissions, more than half of the food was vegetarian/vegan and served by local restaurant partners. We prioritise local, organic and fairtrade food. In keeping with our Substance Awareness & Support Program, we continued our approach to CommunityX events not centred around alcohol, extending the Spotify workplace environment in a different location, with the care for our employees’ mental wellbeing. Therefore, we ensured that there was a broad selection of non-alcoholic beverages and that the atmosphere was centred around creativity and inspiration. All food and beverages were served in reusable or recyclable, non-plastic, packaging. Safety & Security Ensuring that all our employees can feel safe in their place of work (and associated locations) is paramount to being a socially sustainable employer. Therefore, we continued to give attention to the personal safety of our employees, suppliers and performers. We had an extensive security-plan for the event and had several meetings and on-site visits to make sure we had the correct fencing, guards, emergency exits, first aid etc in place. We worked with the most experienced security company in the industry to make sure all guests and staff were safe during the event.

With the macro-economic landscape getting bumpier and windier by the day, we’re heading into tougher times, across all industries. More and more companies are being more mindful of their spending, and many are cutting the sugar from their offerings to employees. This can be tough, but is often necessary in such times, to secure a healthy business. It’s in these situations that our values are tested. It’s easy for organisations to say they are people-first in good times, but if they don’t have values that truly underpin a human-centric way of running a business, it will be obvious. Cutting The Sugar Right now, we all need to be more mindful where we spend our money. We can’t spend as much on ‘sugar’ anymore, instead we need to prioritise more basic staples from the grocery store. Sugar brings some extra spark, but is really empty calories. It might give a rush for a little while, but it’s nothing that will last. Therefore, HR professionals should avoid these sugar rushes as they don’t deliver strategic, or long-term impact. With that said, we should be aware that not everything that’s sweet is sugar. Protein, that will build stronger muscles (or a stronger cultural fabric), can also be sweet. This building of a robust cultural fabric is a necessity to stay strong in stormy times. Employee Experience (And Belonging) It could be assumed that what we do as a Community Experience team (CommunityX) at Spotify is sugar. But we disagree: elevating the employee experience in this way is not empty calories! In fact, we argue that HR professionals who understand the paradox of flexibility and belonging know this is the time to dial up the work that creates a sense of belonging through community. Money invested here gives a return on investment by helping employees feel that they belong, which makes it a whole lot easier for them to be and do their best at work. Retention is also positively affected by creating a strong sense of belonging. It’s like building a house with a firm foundation so that it won’t blow away the day the storm comes, but instead stands strong in the wind. Also, looking further into the future, when the macro-economic landscape becomes somewhat less bumpy and windy, you won’t have to start from scratch building a new house, it is  already strong. That will be a competitive advantage both during and after hard times. Building A Robust Web Of Connections At Spotify, our CommunityX team arranges places or spaces, physical or virtual, where people can connect. Connections help align teams, which in turn gives everyone the chance to find their own place and know where to focus their efforts to have the highest impact. Essentially, it makes your talent and your business more efficient. Since launching Work From Anywhere, we have proactively worked with tools for building connectivity and we know that with the right set up, we can accomplish a lot via virtual meetings and asynchronous collaboration. For the past year, we’ve also had our internal talent marketplace, Echo, which we know is helping our band members to broaden their network globally and to upskill. However, these initiatives are not enough. Meeting your team is likely to strengthen connections to your direct teammates or within your function/department but it can also encourage working in silos. There needs to be multiple opportunities and ways for people to build connections. If we can build a robust web of connections, the fabric of our culture will stand against the test of time, or an upcoming storm. By creating mutual moments that matter, the memories of fun and togetherness that will take us through times of being apart and distributed working.

BENTONVILLE, Ark., and SANTIAGO, Chile, Aug. 15, 2023 — Last week, Walmart Inc. CEO Doug McMillon attended the grand opening of a green hydrogen plant at Walmart’s Quilicura Distribution Center in Santiago, Chile, representing the company’s continued investment in and commitment to renewable energy. Industrial-scale and renewable, the project was developed collaboratively with the generating company Engie. Once converted, the plant is the first of its kind in Latin America and will play a key role in Walmart Chile’s path to net-zero emissions. Walmart Chile CEO Cristián Barrientos, Chile Minister of Finance Mario Marcel, Chile Minister of Energy Diego Pardow and Engie Chile Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Pablo Villarino joined McMillon for the event, recognizing the opening of the plant as a critical step in Walmart’s global commitment to become a regenerative and zero-emission company by 2040. "We see tremendous potential for our business [and] want to expand the use of this technology to [all] distribution centers [in] the company's logistics network throughout the country, with the aim of operating 100% with green hydrogen by 2025,” said Barrientos. "We are already exploring new uses in the area of transport and emergency services where we already have pilots in operation.” In its first stage, the green hydrogen plant will allow the Quilicura Distribution Center to replace the lead-acid batteries of 200 forklift cranes with hydrogen energy cells, cutting 250 tons of toxic waste per year. Over the course of the 15-year project, Walmart expects it to reduce the release of CO2 into the atmosphere by 17,100 tons, the equivalent of planting 34,200 trees. “Walmart first embraced the potential in hydrogen fuel in 2012, with a fleet of 50 vehicles and forklifts in the U.S., which we have since grown to over 9,500 forklifts,” said McMillon. “Now, with over a decade of experience and progress, Walmart is well-positioned to invest in Chile's potential as a producer of clean energy, including green hydrogen. Chile’s potential is tremendous. The Chilean government has made renewable energy a priority, and as a result, Chilean solar- and wind-power sectors have increased their generation capacity fivefold over the last few years, with up to 70% of the country's electrical grid projected to be renewable-powered by 2030. This gives Chile a unique opportunity to develop a competitive green hydrogen industry powered by low-cost renewable resources, while driving a sustainable economy around it.” Walmart has made impressive and meaningful advances toward its climate goals, like incorporating renewable sources through self-generation and the purchase of certified renewable energy. Today, 84% of Walmart Chile’s consumption currently comes from clean energy sources, and its over 390 facilities are on track to reach the goal of operating with 100% renewable energy well before our global commitment to do so by 2035. “We’ve set a goal to become a regenerative company. A company that leaves things better than we found them,” McMillon said. “The energy transition our world needs isn’t an easy one, but by working together, we can do it.”

Walmart announced today new steps to help make the everyday choice the more sustainable choice by adopting measures designed to reduce the amount of packaging waste associated with online orders. This includes moving from plastic to recyclable paper mailers, right-sizing cardboard box packaging, giving customers the option to consolidate shipping on eCommerce orders, opting out of single-use plastic bags for online pickup orders and last mile delivery efficiencies to reduce mileage and delivery times. Reducing waste Customers have hundreds of millions of packages shipped from Walmart each year, which is why the retailer is making it even easier for customers to reduce plastic waste. Moving forward, nearly all orders shipped in plastic mailers from fulfillment centers, stores and marketplace items shipped with Walmart Fulfillment Services, will arrive in recyclable paper bag mailers. This transition is expected to eliminate 65 million plastic bag mailers or more than 2,000 tons of plastic from circulation in the U.S. by the end of the current fiscal year. Additionally, customers nationwide will soon have the choice to opt out of single-use plastic bags for their online Pickup orders. Early tests indicate promising adoption rates and potentially helping eliminate millions of single-use bags each year from circulation. Walmart expects to complete rollout nationwide by the end of the year. “Our commitment to regeneration is core to who we are and how we innovate at Walmart. Customers have told us how excited they are about these enhancements to make it easier for them to make more sustainable choices that support the planet and the next generation,” said Karisa Sprague, senior vice president, Fulfillment Network Operations, Walmart U.S. Right-sized packages and consolidated shipping Walmart is also helping reduce the amount of cardboard used to ship products to customers by transitioning to right-sized packaging technology in approximately half of its fulfillment network. This technology helps create a package custom fitted to the customer’s order. By eliminating unused space in the box, this technology reduces the need for filler by 60% while reducing waste caused by oversized boxes by as much as 26%,1 creating a better unboxing experience for customers. Additionally, all Walmart customers shopping online can now request consolidation of multiple items into fewer boxes, reducing waste as well as the number of shipments. Customers Can Consolidate Shipping During Checkout Faster delivery, fewer miles and boxes Finally, Walmart utilizes applied AI to identify when an item purchased online can be fulfilled from stores instead of fulfillment centers. This reduces both the number of miles driven and the number of boxes used for shipping. To ensure that items can more sustainably travel from stores to customers’ homes, the retailer combines multiple orders on single delivery routes and delivers them using electric vans. By leaning on its 4,700 stores as fulfillment centers, Walmart activates its end-to-end network to speed up delivery times for customers and reduce fleet miles and emissions, in line with the retailer’s commitment to achieve zero emissions by 2040. With a 27% growth in Walmart's eCommerce, Walmart is continuing to invest in the right omnichannel capabilities to not only meet customers' changing needs but also to continue to grow its business and fulfillment network in a more sustainable way. The enhancements announced today represent a key milestone in Walmart’s journey to make the everyday choice the more sustainable choice for customers, regardless of how they shop. These changes, powered by technology, driven by Walmart’s purpose and activated by Walmart’s omnichannel reach, are emblematic of how the retailer is activating its commitment to becoming a more regenerative company by placing people and planet at the center of its growth. These efforts are part of Walmart’s commitment to becoming a more regenerative company, which means prioritizing social and environmental issues that are relevant to its business, important to its stakeholders and issues where Walmart can make a positive difference.

This is an account of the deliberations of the Bank of Canada’s Governing Council leading to the monetary policy decision on July 12, 2023. This summary reflects discussions and deliberations by members of Governing Council in stage three of the Bank’s monetary policy decision-making process. This stage takes place after members have received all staff briefings and recommendations. Governing Council’s policy decision-making meetings began on Wednesday, July 5. The Governor presided over these meetings. Members in attendance were Governor Tiff Macklem, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers and Deputy Governors Paul Beaudry, Toni Gravelle, Sharon Kozicki and Nicolas Vincent. The international economy Governing Council began by discussing recent global economic developments. Overall, the global economy was stronger than had been expected at the beginning of the year. While growth had slowed, consumer and business spending was resilient, particularly in the United States. Headline inflation had fallen in most advanced economies largely because of lower oil prices and easing goods price inflation. Governing Council reflected on some common themes that were evident across advanced economies: 1.	Measures of core inflation had proven to be stubborn due to robust consumer demand, tight labour markets and elevated inflation expectations. 2.	Supply bottlenecks were largely resolved and manufacturing was slowing as the demand for goods weakened, but demand for services remained strong. 3.	Despite substantial tightening of monetary policy over the past year, underlying inflation pressures had proven to be more persistent, leading major central banks to signal that further tightening may be needed to tackle inflation. Members noted that economic activity in the United States was stronger than expected in large part due to surprisingly robust consumer spending. US households benefited from a strong job market that fuelled income growth, and they continued to draw down their accumulated savings. Growth in the euro area essentially stalled in the first half of 2023 due to weak consumer demand for goods and tighter monetary policy. At the same time, the services sector remained resilient partly in response to pent-up demand. Members talked about how the Chinese economy was projected to slow by more than previously expected after a strong rebound in growth following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. Slower global growth weighed on manufacturing and exports, and the Chinese property sector remained weak. This slower growth in China has implications for both oil prices and demand for non-energy commodities. Governing Council noted that oil prices had declined since the last projection, but they could rise again if supply does not keep up with global demand over the projection horizon. The voluntary production cuts announced by several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC oil producers to constrain global supply may outweigh potential softness in demand largely coming from slower global growth and a greater-than-expected slowdown in China. Governing Council agreed that the risk of an emergence of global banking strains had diminished but had not gone away. Yields on government bonds in Europe and North America had increased, while equity prices had been stronger overall since June. The Canadian economy and inflation outlook Governing Council members continued their discussions from the previous decision in June and reviewed the evidence that had accumulated over the last few months about the Canadian economy and the dynamics for inflation. Members revisited their assessment of the surprisingly strong growth in consumer spending in the first quarter of 2023. They agreed that while many factors could have contributed to this strength, the following were likely to be most important: 1.	Tight labour markets and solid income growth were supporting spending. 2.	Additional savings accumulated by Canadians through the pandemic were providing a buffer for higher prices and interest rates. 3.	Strong population growth surged in the first quarter, adding to consumption. 4.	Pent-up demand, especially for services, continued to boost consumption as more Canadians caught up on activities they could not participate in during the pandemic.

Good morning. I’m pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss today’s policy announcement and the Bank of Canada’s Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Today, we raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%. We are also continuing our policy of quantitative tightening. This decision reflects two broad considerations. First, monetary policy is working, but underlying inflationary pressures are proving more stubborn. We have made considerable progress in the fight against inflation. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has fallen from a peak of 8.1% last summer to 3.4% in May. But even as headline inflation has come down largely as we forecast, underlying inflationary pressures are proving more persistent than we expected. Higher interest rates are needed to slow the growth of demand in the economy and relieve price pressures. Second, we are trying to balance the risks of under- and over-tightening monetary policy. If we don’t do enough now, we will likely have to do even more later. If we do too much, we risk making economic conditions unnecessarily painful for everybody. We’ve come a long way, and we don’t want to squander the progress we’ve made. We need to stay the course to restore price stability for Canadians. Let me expand on these considerations and highlight a few key points in the Governing Council’s deliberations. Since the beginning of the year, global growth has been stronger than expected. Lower energy prices and smaller price increases for goods have helped ease global inflation. But we’re seeing persistent inflationary pressures in services, driven by robust demand and tight labour markets. The Bank estimates global economic growth will be stronger this year than we expected in January and April. It is a similar story in Canada. Growth has been surprisingly strong, and the economy remains in excess demand. Consumer spending on services remains robust. And while spending on many goods that are typically sensitive to interest rates has slowed, it has not slowed by as much as we expected. The housing market has also seen some pickup in activity. Several factors appear to be supporting household spending. The labour market remains tight, even if there are some signs of easing. The unemployment rate has increased slightly but remains historically low, and wage growth has been between 4% and 5%, higher than is consistent with price stability. Many households have also accumulated savings since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some households have cut back on spending because inflation and higher rates have eaten into their budgets, and some are being severely squeezed. But for many, larger savings may be acting as a buffer and supporting consumer spending. Rapid population growth is contributing to both supply and demand in the economy. Newcomers to Canada are entering the labour force, easing the labour shortage. But at the same time, they add to consumer spending and demand for housing. Turning to inflation, while CPI inflation has fallen relatively quickly, much of the downward momentum has come from lower energy prices and base-year effects as the large price increases we saw last year fall out of annual inflation. We are still seeing large price increases in a wide range of goods and services. Our measures of core inflation—which we use to gauge underlying inflationary pressures—have come down but not by as much as we expected. Three-month rates of core inflation have been around 3½% to 4% since last September, suggesting little downward momentum in inflation. Consumer and business expectations for near-term inflation are moderating, but they are still high. And businesses are saying they are still increasing their prices more frequently than they did before the pandemic.

This is an account of the deliberations of the Bank of Canada’s Governing Council leading to the monetary policy decision on January 25, 2023. This summary reflects discussions and deliberations by members of Governing Council in stage three of the Bank’s monetary policy decision-making process. This stage takes place after members have received all staff briefings and recommendations. Governing Council’s policy decision-making meetings began on Wednesday, January 18. The Governor presided over these meetings. Members in attendance were Governor Tiff Macklem, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers, Deputy Governor Paul Beaudry, Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle and Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki. The international economy Governing Council began discussions by reviewing recent international developments. Notable developments included: •	the substantial declines in global energy prices •	continued easing of global supply chain bottlenecks •	the abrupt lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in China Overall, global economic activity, especially in the United States, the euro area and China, was somewhat above the Bank’s expectations in the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Council members continued to expect a significant slowing in global growth in 2023 as pent-up demand fades and the effects of higher interest rates restrain activity. Inflation, while still high and broad-based, had receded from its peak in many countries, and Council members discussed at some length how market narratives about the global economy and inflation were shifting. Council assessed the revised US outlook. They noted that US consumers had been resilient, but growth is expected to be roughly flat in 2023. The labour market remained tight. Inflation was coming down, largely due to lower energy prices, and signs of broader moderation in inflation were becoming evident. The impending debt ceiling negotiations could be protracted and pose risks of financial volatility if an agreement were elusive. Council members continued to see the euro area moving into a mild recession, despite surprising resilience to date. Risks related to the Russian war in Ukraine continued to create uncertainty, and higher interest rates were weighing on growth. Council spent considerable time discussing the situation in China. The rapid shift in the Chinese approach to COVID-19 was seen as a new source of uncertainty. Most notably, the outlook for oil prices was subject to an upside risk because of China’s reopening. If Chinese demand were to rebound by more than anticipated, oil prices could rise substantially, putting renewed upside pressure on Canadian and global inflation. Council members reviewed financial conditions, noting that despite continued policy tightening by central banks, conditions had eased somewhat since October. This was considered to reflect a decline in risk premiums across asset classes because headline inflation had edged down from its peak and the perceived risk of a deep recession had decreased. The Can$/US$ exchange rate had been fairly stable at around 74 cents. Canadian economic developments and the outlook for inflation Governing Council reviewed recent domestic data alongside survey inputs, staff analysis and projections. Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.9% in the third quarter, stronger than the Bank had expected. Members noted that strength from commodity exports offset softer household spending, with outright declines in both consumption and housing activity. Still, data to date suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter was also likely to come in somewhat higher than the Bank had previously projected. So, while the economy was certainly slowing, there was more excess demand than expected. The labour market continued to show tightness. The December Labour Force Survey (LFS) reported surprisingly strong job gains. The past few months of LFS data, as well as a broader range of indicators, made it clear that the tightness in the labour market persisted. Governing Council viewed this as a symptom of an economy still in excess demand. Overall, Council concluded that wage momentum was plateauing in the range of 4% to 5%. Persistent wage growth in this range was not viewed as consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target unless productivity increases to well above its historical trend.

Inflation is coming down, but there is still work to do, was the message from Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at a lunch in Kelowna last week that included community leaders and business people. “We know higher interest rates are not easy for Canadians,” Macklem said. The monetary policy is working, but not as painlessly or quickly as anybody would like. “Higher interest rates are painful, but high inflation that persists is worse,” he said. While Macklem and the Bank of Canada board typically hold their meetings in Ottawa, they sometimes meet elsewhere in the country, giving them an opportunity to get to know that community and hear what is on people’s minds. The lunch included a short speech from Macklem, followed by a fireside chat with Macklem and Carolyn Rogers, senior deputy Governor at the Bank of Canada, who fielded questions on subjects including the Bank of Canada’s response to the pandemic, confidence in U.S. and Canadian banks and digital currency. “Inflation has reached levels that we’ve not seen in Canada for almost 40 years,” Mack-lem said. “And while inflation is coming down, it is still too high.” Macklem addressed the Bank of Canada’s recent decision to raise its policy rate one-quarter of a percentage point. “This is the most rapid increase in interest rates in our history,” he noted, adding it takes time for those higher interest rates to seep through the economy. The bank had paused rate increases in January to assess whether they had raised interest enough to bring inflation back to the two percent target. But over the last few months, the Bank of Canada has seen indicators the overheating economy has been more persistent than expected. While headline inflation, a measure of total inflation within the economy, is coming down, underlying inflation, which refers to inflation with volatile factors such as food and energy prices removed, remains sticky. “It’s not coming down as much as we’d hoped,” said Macklem. The economy is still overheated and companies are still having trouble hiring all the workers they need. “The risk is that the decline in inflation stalls,” Macklem said. “That’s really what led us to conclude that we needed to raise interest rates again.” Macklem still thinks inflation will come down to about three per cent this summer. Unlike inflation, Macklem noted the Bank of Canada does not have a target rate for unemployment. “One of the things we looked at to try and hit our inflation target is to get the labour market in a reasonable balance,” he said, pointing out that if the labour market is tight and companies can’t find the workers they need, there are shortages and prices rise, generating inflation. When inflation is close to its two per cent target, usually the labour market is reasonably healthy. The Daily Courier had the opportunity to sit down with Macklem one-on-one following the lunch. Macklem had learned something about the local economy during his visit. The Central Okanagan is seeing a lot of immigration from the rest of the country and the university campus will draw young people to the community. “People want to live here,” he said. “I can see why.” While he sees traditional strengths in the economy such as agriculture, forestry, mining and manufacturing, Macklem said the tech sector is becoming more important. Although Macklem said there are good things happening and a lot of opportunity, the area faces some of the same challenges as the rest of the country with labour shortages. Affordable housing is an issue in the Kelowna area, but Macklem pointed out it’s not an issue unique to Kelowna. The Bank of Canada looks at the housing market to factor into monetary policy, he said, but inflation is what guides their interest rates.

The act of making something every day can be a powerful form of anxiety relief A recent comic by Luke McGarry shows a man in an apocalyptic hellscape, trying to get past a pair of armed and intimidating gatekeepers. “Please — grant me safe passage,” the man says. “I can trade medicine and precious metals.” To which the gatekeepers reply: “Ha! Fool! Don’t you know the currency of the future is homemade sourdough?” You’re not just imagining it. Everyone is baking bread right now. The search terms “bread,” and “baking bread,” have spiked to a 14-year high on Google Trends. You probably know a Bread Guy (or Bread Gal), and may even be one yourself. But why have so many people suddenly become pursuers of the perfect olive loaf or French baguette during this pandemic? One explanation is that making bread can be an existentially healing endeavor. Stephen S. Jones, director of Washington State University’s Bread Lab, tells Wired that, over the years, he has received handwritten letters from three different people who, after visiting his lab, turned to breadmaking to cope with the grief of losing a child. He believes that baking bread is akin to a spiritual experience. “Bread is alive” and “you become one with this thing,” he suggests. To lessen our anxiety and improve our well-being, we’re often prescribed mindfulness-cultivating practices, like yoga and meditation. But another option is to make something every day. You may choose to bake a loaf of bread or pick up an old hobby, or you could try a completely new creative pursuit altogether. Your daily creative task might be to write a poem or sketch a picture, or to fold origami. In this thread on Hacker News, the user Internetvin writes about how the emotional overload of his father-in-law passing away within days of his son’s birth led him to make a song every day. The healing effect of a creative outlet inspired him to build Futureland, a project network for people to record their progress of making something every day. Similarly, as a means of coping in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the designer Michael Bierut started drawing something every day. This practice led him to start The 100 Day Project with his students at Yale. The project eventually found its way online, where participants have shared more than 1.4 million Instagram posts (and counting) of their projects to date. This year’s 100 Day Project starts on April 7. The goal of making something during times of hardship isn’t to be “productive,” or to even achieve anything specific. Rather, the aim is to tap into your creativity to make meaning from the situation — or to find an outlet for your energy that makes it easier to maintain a calm, positive attitude. Your daily creative practice can be as short as 20 to 60 seconds. The key is just to pick something you can do every day. For example, one of Bierut’s students, the art director Zak Klauck, set out to design a poster every day in under 60 seconds. Internetvin has tweeted about setting himself the goal to write just a single line of code within 20 seconds. And the artist Mike Winkelmann has so far followed through on his mandate to draw something every day for nearly 5,000 days straight, even on the day his daughter was born. If you’re interested in setting up a daily creative practice, but have no idea how to get started, here’s some advice: Whatever you pick, you don’t have to do it for 100 days — even 10 days will suffice. Much like mustering the energy for physical exercise through this pandemic, you will thank yourself for exerting the effort. Instead of seeing this isolation as time that’s lost, you can decide to do something with it. And who knows, maybe you can even make something that you love. Once this is all over, you may look back on your daily creative practice as the one thing that made your isolation bearable.

With its launch in 2012, Model S set the standard for Tesla vehicle safety: a rigid safety cell, large front and rear crumple zones, and fortified battery pack. It also set a new bar for the automotive industry—in 2014, it was one of the few vehicles to achieve a 5-star Euro NCAP rating and 5 stars in every NHTSA category. At Tesla, we have a dual approach to safety engineering, which develops passive and active safety systems in parallel, creating an architecture aimed at both reducing the effects of an accident and helping to avoid it in the first place. Relentless Improvement Since its release, we’ve continued to make iterative improvements to Model S safety systems. This is due in part to safety test protocols rightfully becoming more stringent year over year, as well as our relentless pursuit of our goal to engineer the safest vehicles on the road. Rather than official yearly releases, we opt to make safety improvements as soon as they are available through updated manufacturing and engineering changes in new vehicles, and through over-the-air updates to existing fleet vehicles. This ensures every customer receives the latest and greatest safety features available throughout our lineup. Revisiting Euro NCAP Last year, our safety improvement efforts culminated in the release of a new Model S. Following its release, Euro NCAP again reviewed Model S, this time against its newest, most stringent 2020-2022 testing protocol focused on evaluating the vehicle’s ability to protect adults, children and vulnerable road users, as well as its proficiency in crash avoidance and other safety assistance features. Following this test, Model S again received a 5-star safety rating and the highest Overall Score among any vehicle tested in this protocol. It also performed exceptionally well in more detailed tests across the board. These ratings are in part thanks to new safety features that now come standard in all new Model S vehicles: 1.	Collision Avoidance Driver Monitoring System: Uses direct monitoring to detect a distracted driver and automatically adjusts the sensitivity of the Forward Collision Warning system to be more reactive. 2.	Advanced Front-Structure Castings: Using our expertise in large castings, we developed an all-new front structure that absorbs maximum energy and reduces occupant acceleration. 3.	Automatic Airbag Suppression: Distinguishes between humans and child-seats in the front passenger seat; if a child-seat is detected, the front passenger side airbag is automatically deactivated. 4.	Far-Side Airbag: Provides additional protection during side impacts, particularly when there are two front occupants. This airbag deploys between the front seats to help prevent head injuries that could be caused by occupant-to-occupant contact. 5.	Multi-Collision Braking: Automatically activates the vehicle braking system after a collision to help prevent a secondary impact. 6.	Steering Yoke: The yoke airbag deploys, cushions and restrains the driver without the top section of a traditional steering wheel, while also providing a clear view of the instrument cluster and road ahead. Model S is the first vehicle with a yoke to receive 5 stars from Euro NCAP. Accident Prevention The best way to protect occupants is to avoid accidents all together. As noted above, Model S received a score of 98% in the Euro NCAP’s 2022 Safety Assist category, which evaluates the effectiveness of software features in helping to reduce the risk of an accident. This score was achieved with Tesla Vision, our camera vision and neural-net processing system that now comes standard and free of charge in all Tesla vehicles. Our First Feature Model S—and Plaid in particular—is designed to be the most fun you can have in a car: the fastest acceleration, console-grade in-car gaming, sublime sound and more; however, safety comes before all of that—it’s always our first feature. With Model S, we aimed to deliver a step-change improvement in safety worthy of an all-new flagship vehicle. And as is the case with all Tesla vehicles, we will continue to make incremental improvements in safety through over-the-air software updates. While not yet rated, all safety features mentioned above are also available with the new Model X. Deliveries of both vehicles will begin in Europe before the end of the year. Model Y also received a 5-star Euro NCAP rating this year.

Security today released its annual Cost of a Data Breach Report,1 showing the global average cost of a data breach reached $4.45 million in 2023 – an all-time high for the report and a 15% increase over the last 3 years. Detection and escalation costs jumped 42% over this same time frame, representing the highest portion of breach costs, and indicating a shift towards more complex breach investigations. According to the 2023 IBM report, businesses are divided in how they plan to handle the increasing cost and frequency of data breaches. The study found that while 95% of studied organizations have experienced more than one breach, breached organizations were more likely to pass incident costs onto consumers (57%) than to increase security investments (51%). The 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report is based on in-depth analysis of real-world data breaches experienced by 553 organizations globally between March 2022 and March 2023. The research, sponsored and analyzed by IBM Security, was conducted by Ponemon Institute and has been published for 18 consecutive years. Some key findings in the 2023 IBM report include: 1.	AI Picks Up Speed – AI and automation had the biggest impact on speed of breach identification and containment for studied organizations. Organizations with extensive use of both AI and automation experienced a data breach lifecycle that was 108 days shorter compared to studied organizations that have not deployed these technologies (214 days versus 322 days). 2.	The Cost of Silence – Ransomware victims in the study that involved law enforcement saved $470,000 in average costs of a breach compared to those that chose not to involve law enforcement. Despite these potential savings, 37% of ransomware victims studied did not involve law enforcement in a ransomware attack. 3.	Detection Gaps – Only one third of studied breaches were detected by an organization's own security team, compared to 27% that were disclosed by an attacker. Data breaches disclosed by the attacker cost nearly $1 million more on average compared to studied organizations that identified the breach themselves. Every Second Costs According to the 2023 report, studied organizations that fully deploy security AI and automation saw 108-day shorter breach lifecycles on average compared to organizations not deploying these technologies – and experienced significantly lower incident costs. In fact, studied organizations that deployed security AI and automation extensively saw, on average, nearly $1.8 million lower data breach costs than organizations that didn't deploy these technologies – the biggest cost saver identified in the report. Ransomware 'Discount Code' Some studied organizations remain apprehensive to engage law enforcement during a ransomware attack due to the perception that it will only complicate the situation. For the first time this year, the IBM report looked closer at this issue and found evidence to the contrary. Participating organizations that did not involve law enforcement experienced breach lifecycles that were 33-days longer on average than those that did involve law enforcement – and that silence came with a price. Ransomware victims studied that didn't bring in law enforcement paid on average $470,000 higher breach costs than those that did. Despite ongoing efforts by law enforcement to collaborate with ransomware victims, 37% of respondents still opted not to bring them in. Add to that, nearly half (47%) of studied ransomware victims reportedly paid the ransom. It's clear that organizations should abandon these misconceptions around ransomware. Paying a ransom, and avoiding law enforcement, may only drive-up incident costs, and slow the response. Security Teams Rarely Discover Breaches Themselves Threat detection and response has seen some progress. According to IBM's 2023 Threat Intelligence Index, defenders were able to halt a higher proportion of ransomware attacks last year. However, adversaries are still finding ways to slip through the cracks of defense. The report found that only one in three studied breaches were detected by the organization's own security teams or tools, while 27% of such breaches were disclosed by an attacker, and 40% were disclosed by a neutral third party such as law enforcement.

As cyber threats become more commonplace, RBC's Security Operations Centre brings expert talent, methodological approach and a source of calm It’s understandable why those tasked with defending their companies from cyberattacks could be on edge nowadays. One study suggests that hackers attempt to break into computer systems every 39 seconds. Yet Jim Mills, the unflappable lead of RBC’s Cyber Resiliency and Response Program, is known for his calm and quiet countenance. Jim credits his father’s demeanor for his approach. “I’ve never seen him angry or show frustration, even when my brother and I did dumb stuff as kids. I always wanted to emulate his calm approach.” But people shouldn’t confuse his cool and collected character with complacency. Rather, his disposition reflects the quiet confidence of a well-prepared team that is ready for anything. Jim draws parallels between the Cyber Resilience and Response team working on the digital frontlines with the best first responders working in the physical world. “It comes down to training, running scenarios and constantly putting your craft into practice. Things become instinctual, so when something happens, we aren’t dusting off a playbook. We just kick into action and get down to business.” Even during so-called quiet times, the team remains vigilant in monitoring the 18 billion events – individuals logging in and out of bank systems – that happen every day at Canada’s largest bank. Yet the work feels more rewarding than relentless according to the 25-year employee of RBC. “Our team thrives on the fact that what we do matters. Clients have entrusted us with their business. Protecting their assets and information is what we live for. It’s a badge of honour.” A key group with Jim’s team — Security Operations Centre — marks its 10-year anniversary in 2023. This 25-person team of experts provides RBC with a holistic view on cyber security. The speed in which the necessary infrastructure and protocols were built underscored the importance to both RBC’s leadership team and its Board of Directors placed on the initiative. “It took a matter of months rather than years to ingest in every single security log source and build all the custom rules to look for threats. Our technology partner still tells me they’ve never seen a more efficient and effective rollout.” Ultimately, the speed and scope of the bank in building up its capabilities marks an evolution in mindset. “Cyber security is viewed as a critical business enabler,” explains Jim. “Just look at how our efforts helped transform large facets of the bank into a virtual operation during the pandemic.” Importantly, the “360 perspective” also helps the Cyber Resilience and Response team to identify potential threats as well as understand how they came about in the first place. The latter is essential in pinpointing the root cause of any given incident, so that the bank can refine and/or reinforce its defense systems. The RBC Senior Director doesn’t divulge much about the nature of attacks the bank faces, other than to say threat actors have largely evolved their efforts from vandalizing company infrastructure to monetizing their cybercrime activities. As RBC Stories has previously reported, cyber attacks become a big business, which could cost global companies more than (USD) $10 trillion globally by 2025. To bolster its response, the Security Operations Centre has published a framework that provides high-level steps for running an effective incident call as well as standard email and calendar templates, ensuring consistent communications delivery by RBC’s incident managers. Many small and medium sized businesses that work with larger firms like RBC simply don’t have budgets to combat sophisticated threat actors. That is why Jim’s team works with the bank’s supplier management office to share insights on emerging threats, as well as works directly with bank clients to better protect their businesses themselves. “Our aim is to help business owners and operators focus on where they can make the greatest impact to mitigate risk and set up their firms for long-term success.”

The idea of changing your career path after 20+ years would leave some Canadians feeling apprehensive or uncertain. For RBC’s Alice Watt, however, there was an overriding sense of joy in using her existing skill sets in different ways and a new work environment. Alice joined RBC’s Digital team in 2020 after spending more than two decades as a marketing and consumer strategy leader in the publishing, telecommunications and banking industries. Despite some of the adjustments that come when leaving more familiar roles and routines, RBC felt like a natural place to Alice. Especially as she believes the most important transformation is happening in digital banking. “In my role, I have the opportunity to use capabilities built over my career in new and different ways. And the knowledge I get from the team around ways of working and digital product development I find really motivating.” Alice brought a wide range of transferrable skills to the RBC, including her ability to develop talent, nurture positive team cultures, and promote and apply ‘creativity’ to help solve problems and seize opportunities. Creative skills at RBC Digital “Reflecting on my career experiences, I learned that being curious and creative accelerates personal growth and supports a healthy culture — plus it keeps things interesting,” says Alice, who is helping RBC Digital’s Business Analysis and Product teams grow their creative skill sets. The opportunity for Alice and her team is to ensure these skills are part of the DNA of RBC’s Digital talent ecosystem, built through regular learning and mentorship opportunities. In 2022, this included a team-building event at a comedy improv theatre to practice their creativity in fun and dynamic ways. The idea of creativity being central to the RBC Digital Product team and many other Digital teams across the organization is part of broader changes happening to our economy and society. A 2021 report from RBC Thought Leadership found that Canada is “in the early stages of creative transformation.” Creative competencies are “rising to the top,” and these in-demand skills are coveted by many employers, including RBC. The report outlines that between 2020 and 2021, Canadian employers began asking for more creative competencies in job postings, including critical thinking (up 37%) and flexibility (up 20%). That’s good news, especially if you’re a student or seasoned professional wanting to make a similar career change like Alice’s. Aside from creativity, Alice also identifies several other important capabilities fundamental to the product teams at RBC Digital. This includes business case knowledge for a new product, partnering and negotiating with others across the organization. Creative skills and charitable causes Like many of her colleagues at RBC, Alice’s creative skills have also assisted her with charitable causes in her community. Six years ago, she and her friends launched “Stand for Duchenne Canada,” a not-for-profit dedicated to ending Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. From helping families navigate the health care system to organizing charitable events, the creative skills she’s practiced at RBC helped to make the charity a success story. Alice found ways to brainstorm and partner with several talented volunteers to rally together for a cure. Stand for Duchenne recently joined Defeat Duchenne Canada, a planned and successful shift that gave a greater presence to an important cause. “Critical thinking and problem solving have been important core capabilities that I’ve leaned on in every new role. They came into sharp focus when we launched Stand for Duchenne,” says Alice. “It was hard and emotional work to separate the biggest challenge — defeating Duchenne — from the smaller, more immediate impact drivers that would help families and kids battling this rare disease.”

RBCx wants to help entrepreneurs get more 'at bats' to build big, viable organizations. Even a self-described optimist like Sid Paquette sees a glass half empty when it comes to the growing presence of global tech giants in Canada. To be sure, the head of RBCx welcomes the influx of venture capital funding from international investors in recent years. And he will tell you it’s a testament to the country’s innovation ecosystem and a positive signal for Canada’s future prospects. “You don’t make huge investments in Canadian talent if you think our ecosystem isn’t world class,” says Sid. “We’ve got a diverse talent base, some of the best educational institutions in the world, and strong incentives that make Canada an attractive place to set up shop and grow.” Growing international interest in all things Canadian has helped raise the country’s stature on the global stage and contributed to the significant growth in tech employment across the country, according to CBRE. Still, foreign investment only goes so far to reach Canada’s full potential according to Sid who joined RBCx from one of the largest venture funds in Canada, where he led investments in technology and start-ups. To fill the glass, he says, the country needs more home-grown companies to scale globally. “Right now, we’ve got relatively limited examples of Canadian companies creating the kind of growth you see from global firms that are taking full advantage of our human capital. We need more big wins for Canadian tech companies.” A number of pieces are in place to make this happen according to Sid. “Our IP creation incentives are some of the most favourable in the world. Canada also provides a great climate for research and development activities, as well as company creation and hiring. The challenge is to help our entrepreneurs capitalize fully on these opportunities, get them the skill set, the mentorship, the ‘at bats’ to build big, viable organizations.” To do so, the Canadian ecosystem needs to get better on the commercialization side. Sid would like to see intellectual property laws revamped to make it harder for multinationals to scoop up made-in-Canada innovations, which “in a lot of cases were paid for with public dollars through incentive programs.” He also suggests “baking incentives into the system” to keep talent in Canada and, at the same time, find ways to “streamline” the immigration process to help newcomers settle faster in the country. Banks can do a better job in growing the country’s tech and innovation ecosystem too. “Any of the big banks can provide capital,” says Sid. “But we should better leverage the capabilities of those lending the capital.” That’s the aim behind RBCx, which recently combined forces with RBC Ventures to find new ways to create value for tech entrepreneurs – at all stages of growth — and help them scale their operations. The new RBCx entity makes a lot of intuitive sense, given the synergies between the two operations explains Sid. “The Ventures team builds, buys, invests or partners with a bunch of companies. In many cases, they operate those entities, and have access to all sorts of fantastic talent – from development to marketing – to help them scale. On the RBCx side, we have venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, operators, and board members from the tech world. So we’re coupling all this expertise, networks and skill sets into one team. Importantly, he says, the formation of RBCx has helped the bank to carve out a unique space in the marketplace to “build Canadian organizations into game-changing global organizations.” Especially now, as the tech sector is experiencing valuation pressures, Sid says it’s critical for the country’s startup community to have access to industry veterans, like-minded founders, and a broad network of advisors who can help steer them through this cycle.”

When Montrealer Linda Féquière, a former RCMP officer and triathlete of more than 20 years, first approached members of the Lac-Simon Band Council with her school triathlon project, she spoke of her dream of one day seeing athletes from Indigenous communities on the Olympic podium. Two years later, that dream continues to take shape for a dozen youth from the Lac-Simon Indigenous community thanks in part to RBC Training Ground. Growing up in Montreal, Féquière wanted to be a gymnast, but quickly realized that her busy mother – juggling two jobs to provide for her family – would not be able to enroll her in organized sports. She decided to turn her efforts toward running. When she discovered swimming later in adulthood (following an injury keeping her away from logging miles) it led her to triathlon. She fell in love with the sport, but was also struck by the small number of visible minorities alongside her in competition. This led her to approach the Lac-Simon Algonquin community with the idea of creating a Triathlon program. “If you can imagine: here I am, a Black woman from Montreal visiting their reservation and proposing they participate in a triathlon. Let’s just say, the idea was met with a lukewarm reception, at best,” said Féquière. “But when I addressed the same group after the first edition of the Triathlon des nations and told them that while Val d’Or (the neighbouring community) might have gold, Lac-Simon had raw diamonds ready to shine in them.” The idea resonated, and Féquière continued to develop opportunities for the youth from Lac Simon, including organizing a weekend trip to participate in RBC Training Ground. On April 23, twelve of the young athletes working with Linda participated in RBC Training Ground’s qualifying event in Montreal, testing their speed, power, strength and endurance in front of representatives from several national sport organizations, including Triathlon Canada. “For these youth, RBC Training Ground is a tangible pathway to the Olympic dream,” offers Féquière. “But I never forget that it can become a pathway to so much more!” The young triathletes from Lac-Simon also got to meet members of Mohawk communities from around Montreal in a “one tepee two nations” cultural gathering and take part in a behind-the-scenes visit to the labs at the Montreal Insectarium. “RBC Training Ground believes that high performance sport should be accessible to all young athletes, and we recognize there is still work to be done in making our program more accessible to BIPOC communities.” said Shannon Cole, Vice-President, Brand Marketing, RBC. “When we heard about Féquière and what she was doing for her community, it was important to us that she knew how she could support her athletes through our local events.” In addition to encouraging Indigenous athletes to participate at regular qualifying events, this year RBC Training Ground hosted custom testing events for North American Indigenous Games (NAIG) athletes. More than 300 took part. The efforts build upon RBC’s sponsorship of NAIG 2023, where more than 5,000 Indigenous athletes, coaches and team staff from over 756 Indigenous Nations, will gather in Kjipuktuk (Halifax) to celebrate sport and culture. “We recognize that Indigenous athletes in Canada experience barriers to participating in sport, so we want to help make it easier for them to chase their Olympic dreams,” added Cole.

Recipients of RBC Future Launch Scholarship for Indigenous Youth are creating new narratives for generations to come. To forge a new path forward, many young Indigenous Canadians look for ways to balance the heavy weight of intergenerational trauma that has burdened their families and the communities in which they were raised with the future that they see themselves building. That is exactly what the 2023 cohort of the RBC Future Launch Scholarship for Indigenous recipients reveal in their importance of storytelling. Gracefully walking a fine line of recognizing that pain and its role while drawing people into the vision they hold for themselves and their community. Serena Morrill ‘s desire to know more about her biological mother and her struggles with addiction was a key motivator for her to pursue a career as a family physician. The member of Buffalo River Dene Nation she says reconnecting with her family has empowered her to “explore my identity as an Indigenous woman” while studying medicine. The first year McMaster medical student co-chairs the Indigenous Health Interest group, which explores “clinical ways of learning more about caring for Indigenous people.” The social isolation stemming from the recent global pandemic could have been a corrosive force in the nearby communities where Clayton Ritchie of Sumas First Nation lives. But the aspiring lawyer – with plans to attend University of British Columbia or Simon Fraser – says that even as the community had to close itself off from the world during the pandemic to protect their Elders, that they used the opportunity to establish a, community school “Bringing back many traditions including the introduction to drum and song and revitalizing our language of Halq’emeylem. I honestly believe I would be disconnected from my culture if this opportunity did not happen.” The healing process for Brayden Omeasoo-Steinhauer of the Ermineskin Cree Nation includes reconnection to his culture “to help heal the untold things.” Neither of his grandparents taught him Cree because they were not allowed to speak their language when attending school. “This disconnect between me, and my language has been a very prominent challenge in my life.” But as a third-year student at the University of Alberta he plans to learn the language “to talk to the Creator on a deeper level.” It will also help him to better listen and understand “what the elders and knowledge keepers say at cultural and ceremonial events” which ultimately will help him “break the cycle of disconnection that the Indian Residential Schools created.” Recipients also highlight examples of awe-inspiring resiliency that has been passed on from survivors of the residential school system. Mercedes Stemm of Natoaganeg First Nation in New Brunswick writes about her grandmother with both admiration and awe. “Despite being tortured throughout school, my grandmother maintained her culture and continued to pass on her cultural practices to her children and grandchildren.” As a first-year medical student at the University of Manitoba she is making sure “to pass on our culture to my nieces and nephew and will continue to teach as many people as possible.” She plans to become a doctor and return to her community to run a clinic. “Growing up in my community, we did not have any physicians or clinics… “She plans to use the ancestral knowledge taught by her grandmother and other elders to improve the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Community has also been a powerful source of strength drawn by young generations of Indigenous peoples. Saalia Pijamini, an Inuk from Grise Fiord, Nunavut, grew up speaking her mother tongue: Inuktitut. The mother of two is also very passionate about her culture and traditional foods like polar bear, narwhal, seal, and fish. “A community that small is more like a big family, everyone knows each other, everyone supports each other, and everyone takes care of one another,” writes the second-year student at Nunavut Arctic College. Saalia has always wanted to be a teacher. “I want to go back to my home community of Grise Fiord and teach where I grew up and graduated high school. I want to give back to the school that shaped me into the person I am today.”

As a young child, Christina Cleveland lived in a diverse community surrounded by individuals who had varied customs and lifestyles and celebrated various cultural occasions. Still, she and her family felt they fit right in – her mother was Indo-Caribbean and had immigrated from Trinidad and her father born in Canada, of Scottish and English heritage. “There was a connection amongst all of us within that neighbourhood. I had aunts and uncles from all walks of life that weren’t biologically related to us, but who were like family. There was no judgement – the people within our neighbourhood just created an environment where everyone was welcome,” she explains. Moving to a community where Christina and her sister stood out as being ‘different’ But when her family moved to a community that was less diverse when Christina was six years old, everything changed. As biracial, Christina and her sister stood out very quickly as being ‘different.’ The many subtle differences between herself and others – even down to the contents of her lunchbox – quickly made her stand out. She and her sister were teased. Her family’s home was vandalized, and people would sling derogatory remarks in their direction. “Kids made up songs, called us names,” she says. “Others had difficulty accepting that we were from a mixed-race home.” Learning to embrace her authentic self These early experiences made Christina feel resentful about parts of her identity and prompted her to start covering up her heritage in an attempt to fit in. She also remembers her mother altering the way she would present herself in different scenarios – from her clothing to her accent – to fit in and to be respected and accepted. She recalls the emotional toll it took on her family. It wasn’t until she got older, after several years in the workforce, that Christina began to feel more comfortable with who she was and allowed herself to embrace her authentic self. Working at RBC, she says, played a key role in her ability to build up that confidence. Entering a welcoming environment at RBC Prior to joining RBC, Christina worked in other environments where she felt like an outsider at times, and experienced various forms of bias and discrimination, including sexism and ageism, as she progressed in her career. When she came to RBC, however, she encountered a culture where so much was honoured and celebrated, and diversity was encouraged. “Seeing people proud about their heritage and who they were allowed me to dig a little deeper into myself,” Christina explains. Before taking on her role leading the Diversity & Inclusion team, Christina held the role of Senior Director, Strategy & Innovation on the Learning and Performance team at RBC. She was responsible for partnering with strategy owners across the enterprise to identify where learning would help drive performance, and how they could use growth, development and learning to help unlock more potential for employees. One of the areas she supported was the inclusion and belonging learning portfolio, working closely with the Diversity & Inclusion team. In 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and growing civil unrest, it became clear there was more opportunity for learning with the increased curiosity and awareness among employees on social issues. A new readiness to engage in conversations “Events of the last couple of years facilitated a greater readiness to engage in conversations. We introduced learning resources on anti-racism, anti-discrimination and anti-bias,” Christina explains, adding that her team also supported programming on helping people understand micro-aggressions and micro-inequities, how to unlock potential through inclusive actions and how to be an ally. Christina’s leadership capabilities and background in brain-based coaching (which helps people adopt new habits and skills via the neuroscience of learning) and sustainable learning (which builds an ecosystem of relevant learning resources) created such a strong a connection with the D&I team, that when the opportunity to lead the team became available, it seemed like a natural alignment.

For Janet Heathcoat, supporting the banking needs of RBC’s agriculture clients has been a big part of her life for over 20 years. It’s also personal. Her family has been farming Canada’s lands to grow cereals for our breakfast tables and grass for livestock to graze for more than 100 years. So, she’s acutely familiar with the challenges that come with managing nearly 30,000 acres of farmland. But the one challenge that’s keeping farmers like herself up at night? Costs. “Costs are the biggest factor farmers have to consider today because we are at the mercy of the world’s demand for food,” Janet said in a recent interview. “Not in 40 years have I seen it such that managing cost is actually more work than farming itself.” Canadians everywhere are feeling the pinch of rising prices due, in part, to the disruptions in supply chains and international security challenges. Farmers and their families bear the burden of these costs as much as the next person. Many parts of the world rely on food supply from Ukraine, one of the world’s key agricultural regions. Due to the war, its ability to supply global markets has been severely limited. That’s had a big impact on supply, already constrained from the pandemic. In just one example, fertilizer, prices rose by as much as 300% in 2022. While large industrial farms can better absorb this volatility, small and mid-sized farms have much less control over the cost of an input. With commodity prices rising fast, and input costs going up just as much, farmers have to rely more on shopping around or timing the market to buy at the right price. For farmers whose love is working their land, the added burden of finding the right price is an unwelcome one. Meantime, persistent supply disruptions caused by COVID are stalling farmers’ plans to upgrade or replace equipment and machinery. Across the board, machinery and equipment is more expensive and harder to find than ever and suppliers are often unable to commit to delivery dates or a final price because of constrained supply. That makes budget planning a lot harder for many farmers. “In some cases, rising rates are doubling the cost of a loan payment for clients,” continued Janet. “Interest payments used to be a non-event for clients. Now, they’re making conversations about cash flow are more in-depth and more frequent as clients need our help adapting to this environment.” Listening to Janet tell it, you almost feel bad asking farmers to take on more. But a climate conscious world is doing just that. Climate disruption, global population growth, economic volatility and geopolitical stability are all putting enormous pressure on Canada’s farms to feed the world, sustainably. That’s the basis for a recent report from RBC Economics & Thought Leadership – Fertile ground: How soil carbon can be a cash crop for the climate age, which examines three ways to mobilize the capital needed to reduce emissions from Canada’s agriculture sector. “Canada’s farms manage one of the world’s largest inventories of agricultural land and sustainable practices can give farmers unparalleled power to cut emissions, and improve air and water quality, soil health, and biodiversity,” said Mohamad Yaghi, Ag Policy Lead, RBC Thought Leadership, and author of the report. “And while the credit market could be enormous – as much as $2 billion to $4 billion more by 2050 – there remain significant economic obstacles to farmers adopting these practices.” The report finds that, to scale the transition to sustainable agriculture practices, while also de-risking the endeavor for farmers, we need capital. Three financial instruments could help provide it: carbon offsets, carbon insets and government funding. Of these, insetting and government funding hold the greatest potential to make an immediate impact.

Canadian companies are committing to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to tackle climate change. RBC, for instance, aims to reduce its GHG emissions in its operations by 70 percent by 2025 (GHG Goal). An important step in working towards this ambitious GHG Goal is sourcing 100 percent of its electricity from renewable and non-emitting sources, such as wind and solar power. “There are a number of ways RBC can do that,” explains Julia-Maria Becker, Senior Manager, Sustainable Enterprise Operations at RBC. But it’s “investing in new renewable energy projects that can have a direct and significant impact on supporting Canada’s energy transition. And that’s where PPAs come in.” A renewable energy PPA, or Power Purchase Agreement, is a long-term contract with a renewable energy project owner to buy energy at a fixed price from a solar or wind farm that is connected to the electrical grid. (See the infographic below for how PPAs are helping RBC work towards its renewable energy goals.) How PPAs advance our national ambition to transition to a net-zero economy “Corporate Power Purchase Agreements have made a significant impact on renewable energy development in North America,” says Grant Arnold, President & CEO of BluEarth Renewables. “Corporate buyers of power like RBC have helped drive the renewables growth significantly over the last five years.” In 2020, RBC signed a PPA with BluEarth Renewables to directly support the construction of two new utility-scale solar farms in County of Forty Mile, in Alberta. The second was signed in March 2022 with Berkshire Hathaway Energy Canada (BHE Canada), to directly support the development of their new Rattlesnake Wind Power Project in Medicine Hat, Alberta. A PPA provides greater certainty to the project owner since the purchaser has agreed to a fixed price. That guarantee provides the confidence needed to ensure the project proceeds to construction and completion. “PPAs help us by providing income certainty which allows us to make the necessary investments,” says Chris Deakin, Manager Corporate Development with BHE Canada. He adds that as a renewables developer, the company’s strategy is to own and operate long-term projects that will make a meaningful impact. Benefits for all involved The benefits of a PPA are far-reaching. For RBC, they can help to further the progress made towards its climate goals with predictable access to renewable electricity, while helping Canada build renewable energy facilities. “The benefit for the energy consumer,” Deakin explains, “is the long-term predictable supply of electricity. There’s the basic need of a product that has a defined price and volume.” The advantages are numerous from a community’s perspective, not the least of which are the creation of construction jobs. For instance, according to Arnold and Deakin respectively, the BluEarth Yellow Lake and Burdett Solar Project created more than 300 new construction jobs, while BHE Canada’s wind project provided approximately 150 new construction jobs at peak construction. From a longer-term perspective, the advantage is that people want to stay in the communities and operate these farms, and the solar and wind projects are expected to inject $200 million into Alberta’s economy according to the partners’ estimates1. As for the climate impact, the clean electricity purchased by RBC from these projects is expected to prevent 41,200 tonnes of emissions each year, the equivalent of approximately 680,000 tree seedlings grown for 10 years, or 167 million fewer kilometres driven. The advancement of these projects also demonstrates that renewable energy is cost-competitive in an open market and that PPAs can facilitate green investment in the Alberta economy. “Many people assume that renewables are expensive and out of reach,” says Grant, “but the price of wind power has dropped 72% since 2009 and the price of solar power has dropped 90%, representing the cheapest form of new energy, according to the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2020.”

Urgent and thoughtful action is required to place our planet on a more sustainable path. RBC is committed to change and progress, and we will play an active leadership role in accelerating the transition to a net-zero world by working with our clients to support and enable their plans, and in our own operations. We have a clear climate strategy and roadmap — combining short- and long-term actions and commitments that support achieving net-zero in our lending by 2050. As one of the largest global financial institutions based on market capitalization, we will engage through our people and capabilities in every sector and community to make a difference in four key ways: 1.	Helping clients as they transition to net-zero by working with them to understand and shape their journeys, and supporting them with financing, products and services 2.	Holding ourselves accountable by setting interim financed emission reduction targets aligned with our clients’ plans, and transparently measuring and monitoring progress through our lending portfolio 3.	Informing and inspiring a sustainable future by advancing climate solutions and policy through thought leadership, active partnerships across public and private sectors, and support of technology innovation 4.	Advancing net-zero leadership in our own operations by moving to 100% renewable energy sources and minimizing our reliance on carbon offsets, both by 2025, as a way to reach net-zero Underpinning our approach is a fundamental belief this multi-decade transition must be orderly – one that balances the needs of individuals, companies, regions, society and the economy. We have to work with our clients across all sectors, particularly higher-emitting sectors, to enable their journeys, with client-by-client risk and opportunity decisions along the way. In 2021, I was proud of the significant progress RBC made in all four areas of our climate strategy. Notable achievements include: 1.	To support our clients, RBC announced our commitment to deploy $500 billion in sustainable finance by 2025, an increase from our previous commitment of $100 billion, which was achieved in 2020. We continued to make significant progress against our goal, developing financing products that provide incentives to reach climate goals. 2.	We joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a global, industry-led initiative to accelerate and support efforts to address climate change while strengthening the prospects of people, communities and economies. By the spring of 2023, or earlier if possible, we intend to disclose interim financed emission reduction targets for clients in our oil & gas, power & utilities, and automotive & transportation portfolios. Subsequently, within 12 months of disclosing such targets, we will disclose how we are advancing plans to achieve those targets. 3.	We created management accountability across the bank to focus on climate, including in key functions such as Risk Management and Strategy. Climate is a management responsibility in each business and function, bringing additional focus and resources dedicated to our climate commitments and actions. 4.	We accelerated our climate risk analysis capabilities to conduct an initial measurement of our financed emissions to establish a baseline and systematically assess the impact of, and integrate climate risk into, the various risk types that we monitor and manage across the enterprise. We are now well advanced in building the data foundation and methodologies to anticipate and proactively manage risks. 5.	We provided over $10 million to more than 110 universities and charities that are solving pressing environmental challenges like climate change by leveraging technology and innovation capabilities. This brings our total investment through RBC Tech for Nature to over $27 million since 2019 as part of our $100 million commitment by 2025. New in 2021, this TCFD Report details our initial estimates of financed emissions in our lending portfolio. Business loans and project finance represent the vast majority of RBC’s financed emissions, with oil & gas, agriculture, and utilities representing our top emitting sectors.

With higher interest rates and inflation, a competitive salary tops the list for job seekers. But other factors are gaining importance too. It’s no secret – pay is often a key motivator during a job search, especially in today’s economy. With higher interest rates and inflation, a competitive salary tops the list for job seekers. But other factors are gaining importance too, and these four considerations can have big payoffs. 1. Relevant benefits for the real world Gone are the days of free snacks and a ping-pong table as reasons to work somewhere. The pandemic flipped the script on what’s important to employees. Today, Canadian employees say they’re looking for meaningful support in work and life. At the top of the list? A flexible benefits plan that meets their needs in whatever life-stage they may be at, explains David Schwarz who leads Compensations and Benefits at RBC. He says employees value premium offerings that support mental wellbeing, physical health and financial planning. “Companies that provide a modern and comprehensive benefits experience help support employees in the moments that matter during their career, whether the employee is just beginning or nearing retirement,” Schwarz explains. Short-term financial goals are important, too. Nicholas Mizera reduced his monthly bills by about $250 through discounts and savings available to RBC employees. He took advantage of employee pricing on telecom plans, home and auto insurance and a credit card that paid for its annual fee in rewards points. “A few phone calls and emails is all it took to save,” he explains. “I rest a little easier at night and I don’t have to hesitate to say “yes” to my three-year-old daughter’s latest book or toy request. And that’s a great feeling.” 2. Work where you can be you Intangible benefits can positively affect the workplace experience too – like feelings of acceptance and belonging. Knowing you can express who you are at work is critical, says Christina Cleveland, RBC’s Vice President, Global Diversity & Inclusion. One way RBC encourages a sense of belonging is through employee resource groups (ERGs). More than 32,000 employees participate in groups centered common identities, characteristics or interests. ERGs make it easier for team members to find their crew and engage with issues that matter to them inside and outside of work. Kaelan Karjalainen found her crew as an active volunteer with the Greater Toronto Area Pride ERG. “The ERG has allowed me to bring my big ideas to life through support of the 2SLGBTQ+ community,” Kaelan says. “My team has facilitated countless employee engagement events including marching in multiple Toronto Pride Parades, fundraising events for National Coming Out Day, and several virtual Pride celebrations throughout the pandemic.” 3. Making an impact The majority of our days are often devoted to work, so employees want that time to be meaningful especially millennials and Gen Z. Great Place to Work data shows these generations feel especially strong about doing work that matters to them – in fact they are three times as likely to stay with a company if they do. Ashley Tidd is a mortgage specialist at RBC. Her role, she says, allows her to play an important part in helping clients and families with a major milestone. “A home is often one of the biggest purchases of their lives and throughout the mortgage process I really get to know them,” Ashley explains. “Being able to help clients achieve a lifelong goal of owning a home is so rewarding.” Opportunities to make an impact can also happen in communities. Employees are more likely to look for work at socially responsible organizations, like those with a charitable giving program according to the Society for Human Resource Management.

“Trust me.” It’s a phrase meant to inspire a sense of confidence and safety. But if it was that easy, Liane Davey wouldn’t have a 25-year career advising companies about the importance of trust in the workplace. As a New York Times best-selling author and teamwork coach, Liane helps organizations make sense of a small word that contains big meaning. Harvard Business Review research shows that employees in high-trust companies are more productive, have more energy at work, collaborate better with colleagues, and stay with their employers longer than people working at low-trust companies. Liane spoke recently to people managers at RBC as part of an ongoing focus on developing leadership capabilities, and now shares with a broader audience how our brains interpret trust, the pandemic’s impact and practical ways to boost trust at work. It all comes down to who you trust. Our brains interpret messages differently depending on the source of the information. Received feedback from co-workers you don’t trust? Liane says we’re more likely to feel frustrated and second-guess when information comes from someone we don’t trust. But when a trusted person provides feedback, we’re more likely to be receptive. “People are hard-wired to take neutral information and process it differently depending on the level of trustworthiness,” Liane explains. “Trust is a form of psychological safety, and being vulnerable is easier with someone you trust.” That’s because being vulnerable is a risk, and when employees feel comfortable with risk, it increases team effectiveness, she says. Risks might include things like sharing information, asking for help, working through challenging situations and helping others – all things that can be accomplished through trust. “Trust is foundational to all aspects of work,” explains Erin Stein, who guides leadership development and culture at RBC. “It’s especially important for people managers to develop trust with their teams because that’s when teams do their best work.” Liane says there are four levels to trust: connection, competency, reliability and integrity. Connecting is the first step. Yet, connecting with coworkers became more challenging during the pandemic because trust didn’t come as easily in a two-dimensional, virtual environment. Liane explains, “We lack what the research calls mutual knowledge. We don’t have context about what’s going on in each other’s lives. For example, you may be on a virtual phone call, but people on the call don’t see your child off-camera asking for a snack.” She suggests building trust by doing non-task-related activities together, like organizing a virtual lunch together. A more subtle tactic? Wear your company gear. Visual clues that you are all on the same team strengthen your connection. Another key aspect of connection is establishing it early with teammates. The old adage is, “Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to dig a well.” Incorporating trust-building skills starts by making them part of our everyday routines. For example, when team members identify and bring forward issues early, Liane says a simple “thank you” acknowledges and encourages colleagues to continue that proactive behaviour. Integrity is another crucial behaviour and something everyone can model simply by admitting when they make mistakes and learning from them quickly, Liane explains. Trust also relies on discretion. As a rule, leaders should avoid discussing issues that shouldn’t be discussed as a team because that leads to gossip. Have something you need to get off your chest? Go to a peer instead. The final and most important skill? Effective listening. “Listening is one of the core behaviours that leaders demonstrate at RBC,” explains Erin. “By listening fully, we gain perspective and show compassion, which leads to better outcomes.” Listening is about more than hearing what someone else is saying – pay attention to body language as well because that’s where feelings and emotions often appear. Also, fight the urge to multi-task and make sure to give the conversation your full attention, as well as ask open-ended questions to clarify understanding. Because understanding leads to trust in our work and, more importantly, those we work with.

Life is full of surprises. Erin Corstorphine never imagined a career in banking. Not when she was wholly focused on a career in theatre. “There was no other dream,” Corstorphine says, now a Senior Relationship Manager, Commercial Financial Services at RBC. “I started singing and dancing at seven years old, commuted to a performing arts high school and attended a prestigious musical theatre program in college.” But, after spending time in London’s West End, Corstorphine began having second thoughts. A career in theatre typically involves long hours, irregular schedules and a host of other challenges. After one particularly eye-opening audition for Phantom of the Opera, she reached her limit. She was ready to settle down in a career with a more standard schedule. In 2012, having returned to Canada, Corstorphine was soul searching. She had worked at RBC over summers in college, so she decided to return until she “figured out what to do next.” More than a decade later, she’s celebrating a recent promotion in an industry she never intended to pursue – proudly calling herself the “Accidental Banker”. “I have always had an aptitude for numbers but always thought them boring,” she says. “But the actual numbers, while an absolute component and requirement of the role, is only one piece of the puzzle.” Mid-career transitions are very common, according to Lisa Melo, RBC’s Vice President, Learning & Performance. “In addition to Erin, I see it in my family and in the wider talent marketplace.” Melo says RBC is keen to support employees through these career transitions, whether through learning programs, upskilling and, in some cases, reskilling. Assessments, coaching, learning and on-the-job practice help employees move into new and different work across RBC. “Relationship Managers – Erin’s current role – complete a 28-week program that focuses on financial acumen, lending at RBC, client interactions, advice and running a business so they can be successful in their role.” While training and mentorship programs eased Corstorphine’s transition, she was also surprised to discover that she had more transferable skills than she imagined, such as interacting with different types of people, adapting quickly in new situations, curiosity for continuous learning, autonomy to try new approaches and freedom to develop her brand within the company. “All things you do in theatre,” she recalls. But in addition to skill development, it was RBC’s culture of support that played a key role in Corstorphine’s success in an unexpected career. “RBC creates a safe space to learn and grow,” she says. “When I came back from my final maternity leave, for example, I was still feeling a little lost. I knew personal banking wasn’t my end destination. I had a leader at that time who was instrumental in guiding me, helping me think differently and looking in several different areas to help me find my next role within RBC. He helped me find a landing spot that fulfilled not only the consistency she was craving but also what role would fulfill that creative side of my person.” It may have been an accident, but her career is a perfect fit.

Canadians are jumping at the chance to save and invest tax-free for their first home through the new FHSA (First Home Savings Account), according to the most recent data from RBC. "We're seeing amazing interest in this new tax-free account, particularly among younger Canadians who are building a down payment for their first home," said Flora Do, vice president, Investments Transformation & Client Segments, Personal Banking & Investments, RBC. "Since our April launch, tens of thousands of RBC FHSAs have been opened by Canadians – phenomenal early uptake of this innovative way to save and invest for a first home." Available through RBC Direct Investing and RBC InvestEase, RBC FHSAs can be opened digitally through either of these online investment services and through RBC Online Banking. Financial advisors at any RBC branch are also available to help clients learn more about the RBC FHSA, including how it compares to other investment options available to support them on their home buying journey. In addition, RBC is helping future home buyers understand the wide range of investments they can hold within their RBC FHSA: 1.	Through RBC Direct Investing, as self-directed investors, clients can invest in stocks, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), mutual funds, GICs, options and bonds 2.	Through RBC InvestEase, a professional team of Portfolio Advisors will select, buy and manage a portfolio of ETFs on a client's behalf, aligned to their goals, objectives and risk tolerance The maximum yearly contribution is $8,000. However, contribution room only starts to accumulate after an FHSA has been opened. Also, unused contribution room only carries forward to the next calendar year. More than one-quarter (26%) of RBC FHSA holders have already contributed all or most of the $8,000 maximum annual amount and the same percentage are contributing regularly using Pre-Authorized Contributions (PACs). "It's wonderful to see Canadians seizing the opportunity to open and contribute to FHSAs right away, so they can bring their dream of home ownership closer to reality and also take advantage of the tax deduction before the end of the 2023 calendar year," noted Do. "Making regular contributions through PACs has an added benefit too: It helps prepare you for monthly or bi-monthly mortgage payments, after you buy your home." RBC FHSAs: Behind the numbers 1.	The majority (56%) of RBC FHSAs are held by clients aged 25 to 34; 20% of FHSA holders are aged 35 to 44; 18% are aged 18 to 24; and 6% are aged 45+ 2.	More than one-quarter (26%) are contributing regularly to their RBC FHSAs, using PACs – giving themselves a head start on saving and investing to build their down payment 3.	More than one-quarter (26%) of RBC FHSA holders who have already contributed all or most of the annual maximum amount of $8,000 are taking the biggest advantage of the available tax deduction for the 2023 calendar year 4.	As of June 30, just over 5% of RBC FHSA account holders have already made qualifying tax-free withdrawals for their down payment and will also benefit from the available tax deduction for the 2023 calendar year – demonstrating how RBC FHSAs are helping Canadians with their short-term as well as their long-term goals 5.	To date, the most common securities being held in RBC FHSAs are ETFs and stocks. Mutual funds are now also available as an investing option as of June 23, 2023 – in addition to a variety of GICs – through RBC Direct Investing 6.	Canadians with FHSAs who don't pursue home ownership can use their FHSA funds for their eventual retirement. They can transfer their FHSA funds tax-free into their RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) or RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund), with no impact on their contribution limits to those accounts

The Ombudsman for the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces (DND/CF), Mr. Gary Walbourne, released his report today into the treatment of Army Cadets affected by a deadly grenade explosion which occurred at a Canadian Forces Base Valcartier (Quebec) cadet summer camp on 30 July 1974. The incident claimed the lives of six cadets aged between 14 and 15 and injured dozens more. Eighteen members of the Reserve Force, one member of the Regular Force and 137 army cadets between the ages of 13 and 18 were present when inert (dummy) explosive devices were passed around the class. A live grenade was inadvertently mixed in with the inert devices. A cadet asked the instructor if he could pull the pin on the grenade. The instructor assured the cadet it was safe to do. Seconds later the grenade exploded killing six cadets, injuring 65 others. Victims were rushed to the base hospital; the more serious casualties were stabilized and then transported to nearby civilian hospitals. In addition to the six deaths, one cadet was left permanently and totally disabled. Several other cadets were left with permanent disabilities such as the loss of an eye, pieces of shrapnel in their bodies, loss of hearing, and/or psychological trauma. This serious incident sparked several investigations.  A 1975 Coroner’s report ruled that the deaths of six cadets were attributable to negligence.  The military also held a Board of Inquiry immediately after the explosion.  Cadets who had witnessed the explosion were ordered to testify, and subjected to questioning that implied they were being considered potentially responsible for bringing the live grenade into the classroom. Background The Office of the Ombudsman first received a complaint regarding the matter in April 2013. An additional 51 complaints were received over a three-month span. The main themes of the complaints related to access to medical care for long-term injuries, lack of assistance to the most vulnerable who were still suffering, recognition from the Government of Canada for its responsibility towards the victims, the need for a formal apology, and financial compensation. The mandate of the Ombudsman does not extend to investigating events that occurred before the Office was created – June 15, 1998 – unless the Minister of National Defence deems such an investigation to be in the public interest. The compelling issues and perceived discrepancies in treatment and compensation prompted the office to recommend to the Minister of National Defence that he grant permission to conduct a pre-mandate investigation into the matter. Former Minister of National Defence, Rob Nicholson, agreed on May 5th 2014. Objectives of the investigation Our objective was two-fold: Determine whether those present were treated in a fair and compassionate manner based on the standards in place at the time of the incident; and determine the present-day responsibility, if any, of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces to individuals who were affected by the tragic event. Findings and Recommendations The Ombudsman’s Office found that of the cadets who survived the explosion, many sustained – and continue to suffer from – physical or/and psychological injuries; however, the cadets did not receive assistance on par with what was offered to the military members who were also impacted by the incident. The report concludes that it goes against the principle of fairness to provide assistance, compensation and benefits to one group of individuals and to ignore the other, and states that the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence should have done more to assist the young boys who were under their care. The Ombudsman therefore recommends that following the full assessment and definition of the long-term needs of the affected individuals, and in order to ensure that they are treated in a way that reflects Canadian values, it is recommended that the Department of National Defence, under the direction of the Minister, award them an immediate and reasonable financial compensation in line with jurisprudence in similar situations.

OTTAWA, July 11, 2023 - The Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson, Mr. François Boileau, sent a service improvement request to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), asking it to update its processes and its content on Canada.ca to make sure it respects Taxpayer Right 15 of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, “You have the right to be represented by a person of your choice.” The Office of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson participates in several outreach activities each year to promote awareness of our Office. At Chartered Professional Accountants Forum North, we heard about concerns related to the CRA’s approach in its Assisted Compliance program. We examined the Assisted Compliance web page and found that some of the content encouraged Canadians to contact the CRA before contacting their tax preparer, who may also be their authorized representative. Specifically, the page stated, “We suggest you discuss the details of the letter with the CRA officer to make sure you fully understand your obligations before contacting your tax preparer .” Encouraging taxpayers to contact a CRA officer first, before contacting their tax preparer, may create an issue. Taxpayers often rely on the expertise of their representatives for tax planning and may not fully understand the fine details because they leave them in the hands of their representatives. We noted a similar issue during our examination of the CRA’s audit process for charities. During this examination, we found that the CRA directs auditors to contact a director of a charity, not the authorized representative, even if the authorized representative previously informed the CRA to contact them for all financial matters. We understand there will be times when contacting an authorized representative may not be the most efficient way for the CRA to operate, such as when it is collecting a debt that is not in dispute. However, if a taxpayer requests that the CRA contact their authorized representative, then the CRA should respect this choice. Therefore, in the service improvement request, the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson asked that the CRA update its publicly available information to remove instances where it suggests that a taxpayer contact the CRA first when the taxpayer wants to be represented by a person of their choice. After the CRA received the request, it informed us that it was already in the process of updating the Assisted Compliance program web page. The CRA has since finished the updates, and we were pleased to see that the web page no longer has the content that we flagged. However, the CRA should not stop there. It is important that the CRA continue to look for opportunities to make interacting with it easier for taxpayers and their representatives. Background information The Office of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson works independently from the CRA. Canadians can submit complaints to the Office if they feel they are not receiving the appropriate service from the CRA. Our main objective is to improve the service the CRA provides to taxpayers and benefit recipients by reviewing individual service complaints and service issues that affect more than one person or a segment of the population. The Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson assists, advises and informs the Minister of National Revenue about matters relating to services provided by the CRA. The Ombudsperson ensures, in particular, that the CRA respects eight of the service rights outlined in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

The Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) is a business and human rights grievance mechanism established by the Government of Canada. People can file complaints with the CORE about possible human rights abuses arising from the operations of Canadian garment, mining, and oil and gas companies outside of Canada. For more information, see the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise website. The CORE is reporting on the initial assessment stage of a complaint filed by a coalition of 28 Canadian organizations on June 21, 2022, about the activities of Ralph Lauren Canada LP (RLCLP). Pursuant to section 16 of the CORE’s Order in Council, the parties had an opportunity to comment on the facts contained in the report. A summary of the comments received is at Part 5 of the report. The Complainants are a coalition of 28 Canadian organizations listed in Annex 1. RLCLP is a limited partnership registered in Ontario on April 5, 2011, with its principal place of business in Toronto, Ontario and became inactive from April 4, 2022. Footnote1 The complaint alleges that RLCLP has supply relationships with companies that use or benefit from Uyghur forced labour. Some of the information provided and the reports referred to in the complaint refer to “Ralph Lauren” and it is not clear whether this refers to the US parent company Ralph Lauren Corporation (RLC), RLCLP, or to Ralph Lauren as an international brand or retailer. However, the complaint specifically alleges that RLCLP uses or benefits from forced labour in its supply chain. Also, the bills of lading submitted to support the allegations, specifically identify RLCLP as the consignee of shipments from a Chinese company, Esquel Textile Co. Ltd. (Esquel), that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s (ASPI) Uyghurs for Sale report identified as using or benefitting from Uyghur forced labour. The Complainants also cite ASPI’s Uyghurs for Sale report which identifies Youngor Textile Holdings Co. Ltd. (Younger), Jiangsu Guotai Guosheng (Jiangsu), and Esquel as factories in the Ralph Lauren’s supply chain where Uyghurs allegedly work “under conditions that strongly suggest forced labour.”Footnote2 While alleging that all these companies are connected to Ralph Lauren, the complaint does not clarify who is implicated — Ralph Lauren or RLCLP. However, as mentioned above, with respect to Esquel, the Complainants submit bills of lading (from Import Genius) which indicate that RLCLP imported twenty-six (26) unique shipments into Canada from Esquel between August 2020 and March 2021. Based on the dates of the bills of lading, the Complainants assert that RLCLP continued to import from Esquel after Ralph Lauren issued a statement on July 30, 2020, denying sourcing any yarn, textiles or products from Xinjiang. The “Statement on Xinjiang” was issued by US parent RLC in an apparent response to the ASPI’s Uyghurs for Sale report stating: “Ralph Lauren does not source any yarn, textiles or products from Xinjiang. Our suppliers are prohibited from using any cotton grown in the Xinjiang region and we are working with our partners and other brands to identify an effective solution for raw material traceability and verification at the fibre level to ensure that the materials we use in our products are responsibly sourced.” The Complainants allege that the findings of ASPI report and the bill of lading submitted with the complaint directly contradict Ralph Lauren’s (without clarifying which entity that refers to) statement about its alleged sourcing practices in Xinjiang.

Low power wide area networks (LPWANs) are quickly becoming the technology of choice for connecting thousands of devices via the Internet of Things (IoT). Solutions using LPWAN technology use less battery power on connected devices and have a longer range of connectivity than traditional mobile networks – but not all LPWAN technologies are the same. Here’s an overview on the types of services available, and what to watch for when deciding which one is right for your business. The LPWAN options: Unlicensed versus Licensed There are two broad categories of LPWAN technologies. Unlicensed LPWANs rely on proprietary technologies that run over radio spectrum that is unlicensed, which means the frequency can be used by anyone. LPWAN solutions were pioneered in this space and their most common use is transmitting small messages mainly in urban areas. As the name implies, licensed LPWANs (also referred to as Mobile IoT by the GSMA) uses radio spectrum that is exclusively licensed for use by specific carriers. These networks are based on international standards that allow seamless and reliable connections from one network to another. Licensed LPWANs include LTE-M, which provides broad coverage by leveraging the existing LTE infrastructure. Criteria to consider: Organizations should make sure the LPWAN technology they choose will fully support their goals for IoT, said Peter Wilcox, Director of IoT and Business Solutions with Bell Canada. In doing so, there are four main criteria to consider: Coverage: The distribution of your IoT devices is an important factor in determining which technology to adopt. Are they located over a limited or wide area? Are they in hard to reach areas, such as below ground? Are they stationary or mobile? If you don’t need wide coverage (e.g. less than 10 kilometres in urban areas) and the devices aren’t hard to reach or are mobile, an unlicensed LPWAN may be a low-cost option. LTE-M services, on the other hand, are designed to reach devices distributed over a wide area, or in challenging locations, such as deep inside buildings or underground. This makes the technology ideal for smart city applications that monitor devices below ground, such as water pressure sensors. Businesses that require mobile asset tracking, such as the transportation industry, should consider a licensed LTE-M service because it can transfer data quickly and seamlessly from moving vehicles. Security: When choosing an LPWAN technology, organizations should take into account the level of sensitivity of the data to be transmitted over the network, both in terms of privacy of the information and the business importance. An unlicensed network, like LoRa, offers two layers of security and encryption. However, all unlicensed networks use shared frequencies and are prone to interference and vulnerable to attacks. If data sensitivity is a concern, licensed LTE-M networks can ensure message integrity and that only valid devices can communicate over your network, in the same way that current cellular networks do. Reliability: Does your IoT solution require fast or real-time data delivery? Speed is not always a necessity for all IoT applications, in which case, an unlicensed network may be sufficient. Generally, an unlicensed network experiences latency of up to 30 seconds, as compared to 50 milliseconds on LTE-M, said Wilcox. As such, LTE-M is better suited for mission-critical applications, or those that require real-time information delivery. “If a utility has to make a decision to shut down a system based on real-time sensor information, a licensed network may be a better solution,” said Wilcox. Organizations should also think about the flexibility they might need going forward. Is there a requirement for periodic software updates on the devices? Does the solution need to be adaptable to future technology trends, like 5G? Unlicensed networks are based on proprietary technology and may be an option for organizations that don’t need a high degree of flexibility. Licensed networks are standards-based and may be more suited to organizations that want to stay flexible. For example, Bell’s 5G-ready LTE-M network allows organizations to update software remotely – which can’t be done on an unlicensed network.

Today’s mobile technologies keep transportation companies and their drivers more connected than ever before. That constant communication helps ensure accurate, on-time deliveries, enables real-time re-routing when road conditions change, contributes to regulatory compliance and much more. But it also means drivers are using devices while on the move. And that brings risks along with it. Distracted drivers are up to eight times more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers with their eyes on the road1. That’s because it can take no time at all for conditions to change when you’re not paying attention: looking at a mobile device for just five seconds while going 90 kilometres an hour is equivalent to driving a football field blindfolded. As transportation companies look to improve safety without giving up the advantages of continuous communication, advanced mobile technologies may hold the answer. Keeping eyes on the road Push-to-talk (PTT) is a one-to-one or one-to-many communication solution that instantly connects users over 4G LTE, 3G and Wi-Fi networks. PTT significantly reduces distracted driving by allowing dispatchers to gain more insight into the status of their drivers and reduce unnecessary contact with their drivers. Dispatchers can broadcast time-critical information directly to drivers’ mobile phones, and with a push of a button, drivers can respond without having to unlock their phones. A PTT dispatch console can provide vehicle location and tracking information over the mobile network, so dispatchers always know the location of their fleet. PTT also allows drivers to set their status to Do Not Disturb if they wish to avoid interruptions from dispatchers and other drivers. Plus, Bluetooth accessories allow drivers to keep their focus on the road. For example, a Bluetooth button installed on the steering wheel lets a driver respond instantly without reaching for their phone when a call comes in. “In fact, a lot of the opportunity to reduce risk using PTT starts with the dispatchers,” says Bell Mobility Senior Product Manager Chris Hubbell. “That’s because it gives them more options and more control over how and when they choose to communicate with their fleets.” The carrier-grade solution Choosing a security-encrypted carrier-grade PTT solution is important when transportation companies need to provide secure, reliable and instant voice-quality communications anywhere across the country. “The main thing is you need a reliable and effective way to connect instantly with drivers wherever they are,” says Hubbell. “If a driver happens to be out of coverage, the PTT solution will automatically send a ‘missed call alert’ to the driver so they know that the dispatcher has tried to contact them.” Bell gives transportation companies access to Canada’s largest LTE network2 and coast-to-coast coverage for instant, reliable connectivity in Canada and the U.S. – backed by end-to-end support from PTT experts. Bell also offers an integrated PTT solution with a comprehensive dispatch console, a contact management tool and an advanced smartphone app. For transport companies under pressure to meet “right now, right on time” customer expectations that demand up-to-the minute management of routes and drivers, technologies like PTT offer a convenient, dependable way to keep connected and make Canada’s roads and highways safer. The same network that delivers PTT can support other business-critical mobile capabilities as well, like fleet management solutions and electronic logging devices (ELDs), which are soon to be mandatory as per regulations outlined by Transport Canada. “When you start looking at solutions like PTT that can make a huge difference to the safety of drivers on the road, you start to realize this is part of a whole new communications environment for transport companies,” Hubbell concludes. “My advice to people is to start with safety, because that’s what matters most. And then see where the road takes you.”

An ice-cold bottle of Coca Cola journeys from canvas to canvas—starting with Andy Warhol’s 1962 Coca Cola [4] and continuing to a refreshingly diverse and culturally rich mix of classic and contemporary paintings before ultimately landing in the hands of an art student in need of creative inspiration—in a new global campaign titled “Masterpiece”. The latest expression of the “Real Magic” brand platform celebrates how Coca-Coca provides uplifting refreshment in moments that matter. The campaign’s creative centerpiece is a short film set in an art museum, where students are sketching select paintings on display. As one student appears uninspired, an arm from a painting reaches across the gallery to grab the Coke bottle from Warhol’s pop-art masterpiece. From there, it’s relayed from works including JMW Turner’s “The Shipwreck”, Munch’s “The Scream” (re-colored lithograph) and Van Gogh’s “Bedroom in Arles” before finally landing with Vermeer’s “Girl with a Pearl Earring”, whose subject opens the bottle for the student in need of inspiration and refreshing upliftment. In addition to these universally recognized paintings from the past century, the film bridges the worlds of classical and contemporary art by featuring work from emerging creators from Africa, India, the Middle East and Latin America. “‘Masterpiece’ is not a story in which Coke appears… Coke is the story,” said Pratik Thakar, Global Head of Creative Strategy and Integrated Content for Coca Cola.“True to the spirit of the brand—and not unlike the way a synchronized supply chain collaborates to seamlessly deliver ice-cold Coca Cola to consumers at just the right time—a diverse collection of artwork spanning multiple genres, geographies and generations comes together to uplift a slumping teenager. Creating human connection and bringing enchantment to everyday moments is what ‘Real Magic’ is all about.” Coca Cola has served as a medium-agnostic muse for decades, with artists reimagining its iconic bottle and brand attributes. Warhol’s authentic celebration of work provided the jumping-off point for the film, which curates a creative collision of centuries of art movements and  masters from the past and present. “We are excited to connect with Coca Cola to showcase one of Andy Warhol’s most iconic works alongside some of the world’s most universally loved masterpieces,” said Michael Dayton Hermann, Director of Licensing, Marketing, and Sales at The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. “These pieces, paired with works by emerging artists from around the globe, celebrate the inspirational power of visual art through the magical lens of Coca Cola.” “Masterpiece” also includes an online gallery featuring interviews with emerging artists from the nearly two-minute hero film, as well as 3-D billboards and a series of digital collectibles. The campaign launches this month in Latin America, followed by Asia and other markets later this year.

Canada’s energy landscape would look dramatically different than it does today in a net-zero world, with significant changes in how Canadians produce and use energy. A new energy outlook from the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) projects that electricity could take a lead role in reshaping the energy mix, along with key contributions from hydrogen, bioenergy, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Canada’s Energy Future 2023: Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2050 (EF2023) presents three scenarios: Global Net-Zero, Canada Net-Zero, and Current Measures. Each scenario differs based on the pace of climate action in Canada and globally, with two specifically designed to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada by 2050. In both net-zero scenarios, electricity would become the most important energy source for Canadians, while the use of fossil fuels falls significantly by 2050. This will involve replacing current technologies with electricity-powered alternatives, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Greater reliance on electricity also improves energy efficiency across the country, leading to a decrease in energy usage of up to 22 per cent by 2050. New technologies and fuels such as hydrogen, bioenergy and CCUS also play essential roles, especially in decreasing more difficult-to-reduce emissions. To accommodate the dramatic increase in electricity use, Canada will generate more electricity from clean sources such as wind, nuclear and hydro. At the same time, fossil fuel electricity generation without CCUS declines rapidly in response to increasingly strong climate policies. Among all technologies, wind is expected to contribute the greatest amount of new electricity generation by 2050, increasing over ninefold from current levels in both net-zero scenarios. Overall, the electricity sector is projected to achieve net-zero emissions by 2035 and become net-negative thereafter due to using bioenergy with CCUS. The oil and gas industry significantly reduces emissions using various technologies through the projection period. At the same time, the pace of global climate action will have a direct impact on lowering global demand and prices for oil and gas in the long run. This is projected to lead to a decline in oil and gas production in Canada by 2050. This decline is most significant in the Global Net-Zero Scenario, where the rest of the world is taking actions to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C. However, fossil fuels will still play an important part in Canada’s energy system, particularly in industrial facilities outfitted with CCUS or for non-energy use like asphalt and petrochemicals. Achieving net-zero emissions will require significant contributions from all sectors of the economy, with the most significant reductions coming from the transportation, electricity, and oil and gas sectors. The report indicates that several sectors, like buildings, heavy industry and oil and gas, will have positive GHG emissions by 2050 in both net-zero scenarios. However, net-negative emissions from other sectors, including the electricity sector, will offset these positive emissions. The CER produces timely, fact-based, and relevant energy analysis to inform the energy conversation in Canada. This long-term Canadian energy supply and demand outlook covers all energy commodities and Canadian provinces and territories and makes projections to 2050 using economic and energy models. The results in EF2023 are not predictions about the future nor are they policy recommendations. Rather, they are the product of scenarios based on a specific premise and set of assumptions.

In fact, the data shows that the mere presence of Shop Pay, even when it isn't used by a buyer, results in higher conversion by 5%. “Enterprises that don’t take advantage of Shop Pay are self-sabotaging. They are leaving money on the table,” said Kaz Nejatian, VP Product and Chief Operating Officer of Shopify. “This is critical optionality in a hyper competitive retail environment. In an economy where big brands are competing more fiercely than ever to acquire customers, they need to pick and choose what they need to boost the top-line, without the compromise of a complete platform overhaul.” Why is Shop Pay so powerful? We’ve been able to build the world’s best-converting checkout because of four key advantages: Shopify’s massive identity network, unmatched scale, consumer trust, and velocity of innovation. When someone with a Shop Pay account visits an online store, Shopify recognizes them with one click. If they’ve used Shop Pay recently, our checkout can recognize most customers without any user action. That means Shop Pay can pre-fill all their information for a seamless one-click checkout—leading to a 4x faster experience than a guest checkout. More enterprise payment choices with upgraded Adyen integration For enterprise retailers, choice matters. Different businesses have different payment requirements, and that’s why Shopify currently offers 1,000+ payment gateways. Adyen has been one of those gateways for years —and now we’re leveling up our integration specifically for enterprise retailers. Adyen makes it easy to accept a wide variety of payments in markets around the world, including credit cards, wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, international payment methods like iDEAL in the Netherlands and Cartes Bancaires in France, and more. This integration is expected to roll out later this year.

Discover over a million beloved brands, unlock rewards, and track your purchases all in one spot? Meet the Shop app: the most rewarding way to shop. Today, Shopify officially launched Shop Cash: a new rewards program that earns shoppers 1% Shop Cash on purchases made using Shop Pay, the world’s fastest checkout. It now pays to use Shop Pay, and it couldn’t be easier.  After a purchase, shoppers will see their Shop Cash rewards balance appear in their Shop app—just like magic. These rewards are redeemable on future purchases within Shop. “This is a coming of age moment for Shop. It’s become an incredible app that allows shoppers to discover great brands, check out with one tap, and track orders in real time,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “Shop Cash represents the next evolution of Shop, connecting independent brands to more shoppers, and rewarding those shoppers for being loyal fans.” Shopify celebrates its birthday by giving back to merchants and shoppers To celebrate the launch of Shop Cash (and Shopify’s 17th birthday! 🎉), we’re hosting our inaugural Shop Day on June 2—and we’re giving away more than $1,000,000 in Shop Cash. To do this, we’re partnering with dozens of merchants, from MrBeast to Monday Swimwear, to share custom links across their social channels to their fans. Shoppers can redeem Shop Cash by clicking on those links and spending directly in the Shop app. Their Shop Cash can be redeemed for up to 30 days once it’s been claimed. Every day is a good day to shop from independent brands in the Shop app, but Shop Day is even better! Shop Day comes hot on the heels of Shop’s most prolific flash sale ever. The YouTube phenomenon MrBeast sold exclusive collectibles within an hour on his customized Shop storefront. “From flash sales with the internet’s biggest creators like MrBeast through to independent retailers just getting started, Shop is the destination for commerce today,” added Harley Finkelstein. Even better, to celebrate Shop Day, hundreds of brands are running exclusive Shop Cash offers. Through Shop Cash offers, shoppers will find incentives to explore new brands and can boost their Shop Cash by 2x, 5x, and 10x. The more they spend, the more they earn. It’s a win-win for everyone. Shop Pay on Shop is a superpower for brands We’ve coupled the conversion power of Shop Pay with Shop to make it easy for brands to find and retain customers. Over 100 million high-intent, high-value buyers are opted into one-click checkout with Shop Pay. It’s the single most popular and trusted digital wallet on Shopify. The proof is in the data: •	On the Shop app, shoppers spend more money and are more likely to come back. Every day, thousands of shoppers buy from a merchant for the first time, and 35% of the orders on the Shop app are repeat purchases. •	Merchants are more likely to convert shoppers with Shop Pay. Research from one of the Big 3 consulting firms notes that Shop Pay can lift conversion by as much as 50% compared to guest checkout, outpacing other accelerated checkouts by as much as 15%. The Shop Cash rewards program is available immediately on all eligible Shop Pay purchases from merchants and shoppers based in the US, and redeemable only in the Shop app. To learn more about Shop and its offerings, including Shop Cash, click here.

We need to talk about the cost of bad search. A Google Cloud-commissioned Harris Poll survey found that search abandonment—when a consumer looks for a product on an online store, doesn't find what they want, and leaves—costs retailers around the world more than $2 trillion annually. Enterprise businesses with 1000s of SKUs don't just need great search—they can't afford to do business without it. That’s why we’ve deepened our long-standing partnership with Google to bring Google Cloud’s search and discovery tooling to enterprise brands using Commerce Components by Shopify. Discovery AI solutions will be available to the largest brands in the world to integrate directly with their online stores using Commerce Components by Shopify. “Our partnership with Google Cloud brings together the best in commerce with the best in search to unlock a trillion dollar opportunity for brands,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “We know that 69% of consumers in the US alone say a store’s search is the most common way they shop, but only around 10% are getting consistently accurate search results. It’s a massive problem that we’re excited to help enterprise retailers solve through our continued work with Google.” Google Cloud’s Discovery AI solutions include capabilities like: 1.	Retail Search to provide advanced understanding and better results for even the broadest queries, including non-product and semantic search to effectively match product attributes with store content, leading to fast, relevant product discovery 2.	AI-powered personalization providing optimal product display and ordering once shoppers choose a category, like "women's jackets" or "kitchenware." In addition, search personalization and recommendations AI surface products by recognizing patterns in a consumer’s behavior, such as clicks, adds to cart, purchases, and other information to determine shopper taste and preferences “Google Cloud’s integration with Shopify enables brands to quickly deploy the power of AI,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. “By making it easier for retailers to create best-in-class product discovery experiences, shoppers can now find exactly what they want faster.” One of the first Shopify retailers to use the integration is Rainbow Shops, an apparel brand with locations across the U.S. and 1000s of products. “For a retailer of our size, working with a commerce platform that unlocks agility and flexibility for all parts of our business is critical,” said David Cost, Vice President of eCommerce and Marketing at Rainbow Shops. “Shopify, and their partnership with Google Cloud, means that we easily integrated Google-quality search directly with our online store, and the results speak for themselves with search volume up 48%.” Commerce Components by Shopify, the modern, composable stack for enterprise retail, launched earlier this year. Existing enterprise retailers on Shopify include Mattel, Glossier, JB Hi-Fi, Coty, Steve Madden, Spanx, and Staples. Learn more about Commerce Components by Shopify here. Google Cloud’s Discovery AI solutions are available globally to enterprise retailers using Commerce Components by Shopify.

Trillions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of jobs. Exceptional leaders, thinkers, and innovators. Women play a critical role in powering nearly every economy on earth. At Shopify, 53% of our global entrepreneurs are women. Where the idea of women as entrepreneurs was once unthinkable, there are now more than 413 million women entrepreneurs worldwide. And while it’s still tougher for women to raise venture capital and wage inequality persists, data shows businesses led by women earn more for every dollar invested than their male counterparts. Shopify champions women-led businesses every month, not just this one. But since it’s March, and since we have you here, we want to introduce you to three incredible companies led by women determined to inspire change in their corners of the world and well beyond. We’ll be cheering from the sidelines as they do. Making counter space for Latin beauty brands In 2020, Sandra Velasquez launched Nopalera, a beauty brand that celebrates her Mexican culture. Three years later, Nopalera is now on shelves at major retailers including Credo Beauty, Nordstrom, and Free People. “I had this idea, this big bold vision that I was going to create a high-end Latina brand that’s going to disrupt the historically Euro-centric beauty space,” Velasquez said. “The more French a word is, the more expensive we think the product should be. If it’s in Spanish, people ask, why is it so expensive? Our culture is rich, beautiful, and worthy of the same price tags.” Velasquez grew up in California, the daughter of Mexican immigrants. Her hometown streets were dotted with nopales, the prickly cacti that would later inspire her to strike out on her own as an entrepreneur. By 43, after a long, successful career as a musician and a stint in sales in the grocery industry in New York, Velasquez couldn’t see a clear path forward. She knew she was capable of more, but wasn’t sure how to get there or what more looked like. She could get another sales job, she thought. Or she could take the risk and try something new. “It forced me to look outside of what I thought my reality could be, to look outside what I thought was possible.” For seven months before launch, she worked three jobs and came home to her Brooklyn apartment at night to pursue a degree in organic skincare formulation in her kitchen-turned-laboratory. She used the oil from the nopales she’d grown up with to create soaps, exfoliants, and moisturizers. Fast forward to today, and you can still find Nopalera on her kitchen table. You can also find it on the shelves of more than 400 boutiques across the U.S. “What drives me? In ten years, you’re going to see our logo on the pitch deck of another Latina entrepreneur. Someone has to be first.” A cancer diagnosis leads to the sweetest discovery In her years traveling across the Middle East and India to visit her husband’s family, Kathryn Shah always admired the way other cultures presented fruit, nuts, and dates as decadent, elevated indulgences. It was such a stark contrast, she thought, to the way they were kept in dusty bulk bins back home in the U.S. When Shah was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 35, she had an idea. “Everyone was sending me chocolate boxes and cookies. It was lovely, but I’d look at the label and it was crazy what all of these foods included.” One cake she received had 50 ingredients, many of which she found were linked to tumorous cancer growth. “I thought, there has to be something better. Something that’s delicious and beautiful and chic and cool – and good for you.” Shah began to experiment in her Raleigh, North Carolina kitchen with her friend Sarah Bell, trying to find the perfect blend of sweetness using the natural ingredients she’d loved when she traveled. The pair toyed with lavender, cardamom, pistachio, mulberries, even fennel – whatever flavors piqued their interest. More than 40 iterations later, they created a chocolate bar that met their exacting standards. Spring & Mulberry was born.

At Shopify, we know the only way to future-proof our planet is to reverse climate change. Even if we stopped all emissions right now, there’s still too much carbon in the atmosphere. No solution will single-handedly solve this problem. When it comes to scaling carbon removal technologies, there’s much more work to do. Since we launched our Sustainability Fund in 2019, Shopify has been buying carbon removal as part of our effort to kickstart an industry in its infancy. Today, alongside Stripe, we’re purchasing $11 million worth of carbon removal from six new companies: Arbor, Captura, Carbon To Stone, Cella, CREW, and Inplanet. It’s an exciting development in our fight to reverse climate change. We’re inspired by the caliber and rate of new companies entering the market. Through these purchases, we’re making it possible for them to prove their impact and scale. These six new companies bring the total backed by Shopify to 28. Below, you can read more about each new partner. These new purchases are just one part of the critical work Shopify has done this year to help accelerate this market. Here’s what else we’ve been up to in 2022: Sustainability Fund Progress To start the year, Shopify’s Sustainability Fund added nine new businesses to our portfolio. Our purchases helped them bring their vision to market and increase adoption of their offerings. Through our Fund activities, we’ve helped multiple companies raise over $50 million in capital and increase their employee count by more than 5x, which has enabled them to grow their carbon removal capacity by more than 1000x. Frontier This spring, we launched Frontier, an advance market commitment (AMC), alongside Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability. As founders of Frontier, we committed to spending a combined $925 million on carbon removal by the end of 2030 – a signal to innovators, investors, and project developers that there is a market for carbon removal, and we all need to get to work scaling the industry. Shopify Planet In June, we released Planet, an app that Shopify merchants can use to zero out their shipping emissions. Planet calculates the estimated shipping emissions from every order. Merchants then remove these emissions by funding the same carbon removal companies supported by Shopify. Since launch, more than 8,000 Shopify merchants have used Planet to neutralize their shipping emissions on more than six million orders, totaling over 5,000 tonnes of carbon removal. Shopify merchants can install Planet from the Shopify App Store. Buying Carbon Removal, Explained Most recently, we published Buying Carbon Removal, Explained. It’s a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to support carbon removal but has hit roadblocks along the way. Buying Carbon Removal, Explained covers everything from researching suppliers to inking your first carbon removal contracts, and what to say to scrutinizing finance teams. We’re committed to doing all we can to generate demand for carbon removal, enable new companies to prove their impact and scale, and spend millions every year to drive down future prices. I recently had the privilege of speaking more about this at the TED Countdown London Session. You can check it out at go.ted.com/stacykauk. That’s it for now. Subscribe to our mailing list for updates from us in 2023. We’ve got even more planned for the new year, as our work continues.

Shopify is built on components that form the world's most powerful retail platform. We've spent nearly two decades building, optimizing, and scaling that infrastructure, which today powers over 10% of US ecommerce and has processed over half a trillion dollars—all while giving millions of businesses full control of their brand identity, customer relationships, and data. Now, we’re opening that infrastructure to power the biggest retailers in the world with Commerce Components by Shopify (CCS), the modern, composable stack for enterprise retail. For enterprise retailers today, challenges like the rapid pace of tech evolution and shifting customer expectations mean they must achieve real-time innovation just to remain competitive. To do that, they need a commerce solution that prioritizes choice, with the flexibility to integrate and innovate without restrictions, while offering trusted infrastructure components that help their teams move faster. These elements together are non-negotiable, and have never existed in one offering for enterprise—until now. Commerce Components by Shopify combines the best of both worlds for enterprise retailers: access to Shopify’s foundational, high-performing components that just work—like our checkout, which converts 72% better than a typical checkout, and 91% better on mobile—plus flexible APIs to build dynamic customer experiences that integrate seamlessly with a retailer’s preferred back office services. “We’ve always approached innovation at Shopify by anticipating what retailers need, then providing those solutions,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “Commerce Components by Shopify opens our infrastructure so enterprise retailers don’t have to waste time, engineering power, and money building critical foundations Shopify has already perfected, and instead frees them up to customize, differentiate, and scale.” Iconic American brand Mattel will be one of the first enterprise retailers to use Commerce Components, bringing their entire portfolio of brands to Shopify. “Innovation is at the heart of Mattel,” said Sven Gerjets, CTO of Mattel. “We first worked with Shopify on a project called Mattel Creations, a platform for creators to reimagine the most iconic toys in the world. Creations empowered Mattel to move quickly, meet our customers where they are, and most importantly leverage Shopify’s infrastructure to scale globally. It was hugely successful, and we’re excited to transform our brand offerings using Commerce Components.” Featuring an all-new back-office management designed specifically for enterprise, Commerce Components by Shopify gives retailers the speed and flexibility needed to build for the future. Build with choice Flexible APIs, now with no rate limits, allow brands to integrate their existing services with Shopify’s modular components and build unparalleled customer experiences for any device. Enterprise retailers can take the components they need, and leave what they don’t, and developers are free to build with any front-end framework they choose. Tap into unmatched global scale Trusted commerce foundations, like the world’s best-converting checkout, with 99.99% uptime, processing up to 40,000 checkouts per minute per store, and unlocking over 100 million existing Shop Pay customers, who have opted in for Shopify’s one-click checkout. Shopify’s globally scaled infrastructure with over 275 network edge points of presence enables lightning-fast storefronts no matter where customers are in the world. Partner with a world-class ecosystem The largest commerce ecosystem in the world, including a dedicated account team with solutions architects, priority 24/7/365 specialized support, and a network of seasoned agency partners and system integrators like Deloitte, EY, and KPMG. View a full list of the components in Commerce Components by Shopify here. “We know that retailers have a myriad of opportunities in the digital and data age, whether it’s the shifting digital advertising landscape or showing up for their customers in a differentiated way during a looming recession,” said Sam Roddick, Global Deloitte Digital Leader. “In challenging times, we have seen best-in-class alliances between our clients and their platform partners unlock these opportunities. That’s why we’re thrilled to work with Shopify to bring Commerce Components by Shopify to enterprise retailers globally. Shopify is an industry leader in commerce, and we believe Commerce Components will be the advantage in helping propel the world’s largest retailers into the next era of commerce.”

As a global provider of essential internet infrastructure for commerce, Shopify announced today a record-setting Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend, with sales of $7.5 billion* from independent businesses worldwide. That’s a 19% increase in sales from the $6.3 billion during Shopify’s Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend in 2021 (21% on a constant currency basis). Consumers are approaching this holiday shopping season with intentionality. They’re seeking out good deals from their favorite brands. Shopify’s recent survey of more than 24,000 consumers around the world revealed that three in four (76%) were seeking higher-quality products that will last, and the majority (84%) planned to compare prices for the best discounts before making a purchase during Black Friday Cyber Monday Weekend**. More than 52 million consumers globally purchased from brands powered by Shopify this year, a 12% increase from 2021. Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend is the highest volume shopping event of the year for Shopify merchants. And, while not a proxy for the full holiday season, it is a moment that showcases the power and impact independent businesses have around the globe. “This year, Black Friday Cyber Monday showed us once again that consumers are voting with their wallets to support the independent brands they love,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “We saw record level shopping happening across all channels this weekend, proving businesses that meet their customers where they are, whether that’s online or in-person, will earn their loyalty in return.” 2022 Black Friday Cyber Monday Global Highlights 1.	Black Friday saw the highest shopping volume moment during the weekend, with peak sales of more than $3.5 million per minute at 12:01 PM EST on November 25. 2.	52 million consumers worldwide purchased from independent brands powered by Shopify, a 12% increase from 2021. 3.	Shoppers’ spend climbed across many countries, with consumers globally spending $102.10 per order on average throughout the weekend (or $104.80 on a constant currency basis) compared to the global average of $100.70 we shared last year***. 4.	The top-selling cities shoppers made purchases from include London, New York, and Los Angeles. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada were among the top-selling countries worldwide. 5.	Top product categories: Apparel & accessories, followed by health & beauty, and home & garden, with trending products including: Gymshark (Training Leggings), MIELLE (Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil), and  Our Place (Always Pan). 6.	Black Friday Cyber Monday proved once again to be driven by online sales, with 73% of sales made on mobile devices and 27% on desktop. 7.	Cross-border orders represent 15% of all global orders and the most popular cross-border routes include Canada-United States, United States-Canada, and United Kingdom-United States. 8.	56,000+ tonnes of carbon removal funded to counteract emissions from the delivery of every order placed on Shopify’s platform during Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend. Climate-conscious shoppers are increasingly searching for brands with sustainable practices, such as carbon-neutral shipping**. For the third year in a row, Shopify is purchasing enough carbon removal to counteract the carbon emissions from shipping every order on our platform this Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend. This has resulted in Shopify funding 56,000+ tonnes of carbon removal. You can read more about our efforts here.

Team, I’m sitting down to write this email not far from where I once sat down to write the first few lines of code for Shopify itself. Those lines of code started a company and sent it on a fascinating journey full of wonder, toil, success, failure, ambition, and above all else comradery. Being on a journey, surrounded by great teammates, doing difficult things is what it's all about. All this makes this email so much harder to write: the next part of the journey will involve fewer teammates than we have picked up along the way. Shopify has to go through a reduction in workforce that will see about 10% leave by the end of the day. Most of the impacted roles are in recruiting, support, and sales, and across the company we’re also eliminating over-specialized and duplicate roles, as well as some groups that were convenient to have but too far removed from building products. Emails will go out in the next  few minutes that will clarify if your role was affected; those impacted will then have a meeting with a lead in their team. For a company like ours this news will be difficult to digest. It will be even harder for those leaving today. I’ll share as many details as I can about how we got here and, for those that are leaving, what will happen next. How we got here When the Covid pandemic set in, almost all retail shifted online because of shelter-in-place orders. Demand for Shopify skyrocketed. To help merchants, we threw away our roadmaps and shipped everything that could possibly be helpful. It was hard, but we know for a fact that more merchants’ businesses survived the pandemic because of the work we did in this time and that’s exactly what our mission is about. Shopify has always been a company that makes the big strategic bets our merchants demand of us - this is how we succeed. Before the pandemic, ecommerce growth had been steady and predictable. Was this surge to be a temporary effect or a new normal? And so, given what we saw, we placed another bet: We bet that the channel mix - the share of dollars that travel through ecommerce rather than physical retail - would permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years. We couldn’t know for sure at the time, but we knew that if there was a chance that this was true, we would have to expand the company to match. Source: US Census Bureau It’s now clear that bet didn’t pay off. What we see now is the mix reverting to roughly where pre-Covid data would have suggested it should be at this point. Still growing steadily, but it wasn’t a meaningful 5-year leap ahead. Our market share in ecommerce is a lot higher than it is in retail, so this matters. Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust. As a consequence, we have to say goodbye to some of you today and I’m deeply sorry for that. To those leaving Shopify Everyone will feel this news in their own way, but what’s universally true is that it will be hard for everyone. We want to support each of you through the coming weeks and months as much as possible, so we’re offering a generous severance package. Those affected today will get 16 weeks of severance pay, plus an additional week for every year of tenure at Shopify. We’ll remove any equity cliff, and extend any medical benefits. I want to express my sincere gratitude to each of you for everything you’ve given to support merchants and our mission of making commerce better for everyone.

Commerce is a global industry, with global opportunity. That’s why, in 2021, we launched Shopify Markets to remove the barriers to cross-border selling and empower Shopify merchants to become global by default. Since then, more than 175,000 merchants across the world have used Markets to help launch their international businesses. In the US, merchants using Shopify Markets sell into 14 other countries on average. "Using Shopify markets has been a game changer for us. It has given us transparent, easy-to-digest data that helps inform how we are performing globally," said David Wiggins, Head of Ecommerce at Walk London. "Utilizing this data has also allowed us to make more strategic marketing decisions, such as offering an improved shipping service, more localized payment methods or introduce new languages appropriate to specific markets. This all helps fuel our growth strategy." Now, we’re building on the success of Shopify Markets with the launch of Shopify Markets Pro and Shopify Translate & Adapt to make cross-border commerce even easier for Shopify merchants who want to accelerate their global expansion without adding complexity. Shopify Markets Pro will help merchants go global overnight Shopify Markets Pro is our native merchant-of-record solution powered by our partnership with Global-e that makes it simple for Shopify merchants to expand their businesses globally to 150+ countries overnight. Here’s how: 1.	Manages compliance on behalf of the merchant. Tax and duty compliance are different in every market and can often change; currencies fluctuate; and merchants need to be cautious of increasing fraudulent orders. All of these obligations make entering new markets slow and expensive. By using Shopify’s native merchant-of-record solution, all of this complexity is handled for the merchant at scale. 2.	 Accesses affordable express shipping with DHL. Negotiating affordable international shipping rates as an individual merchant is difficult, particularly for express shipping. With Markets Pro, Shopify negotiates on their behalf, giving merchants access to preferred competitive rates so they can delight consumers with fast shipping and prepaid duties. 3.	Creates a seamless consumer experience. Consumer expectations are different in every market, and we know that creating a localized, seamless customer experience is key to effective international selling. Consumers want to shop in their local currency, with their preferred payment method and without surprise duty fees on delivery. In fact, we have found that selling in a local currency increases GMV from international buyers by 7%*, and enabling local payment methods increases checkout rate by approximately 6%**. Markets Pro makes it simpler to optimize the consumer experience, building on the success of Shopify Markets to increase conversion by solving complexities like local currency, payment methods, shipping, and tax and duties at scale. “Shopify Markets Pro has simplified and scaled our global expansion strategy without adding any of the complexity that we would typically face when selling to international consumers,” said Jake Allain, COO at State & Liberty Clothing Co. “Understanding the nuances of global markets is a daunting task, and having that managed for us by Shopify, the platform we’re already using to build our business, has allowed us to focus on designing high quality products.” “Whether selling internationally for the first time, or scaling a nascent part of their business, merchants are faced with new and evolving complexities, like tax, duties, pricing, language and payments. With Shopify Markets Pro, and our partnership with Global-e, we’re empowering merchants to rapidly scale their international sales using a merchant-of-record solution that would typically be inaccessible to independent brands,” said Rohit Mishra, Director of Product at Shopify. “And because Markets Pro is integrated directly with the Shopify admin, it gives merchants a single, unified view of their business—no matter where they’re selling.” Learn more about how Shopify Markets and Shopify Markets Pro can help with international expansion here.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was 2021. We had one heck of a year, and so did our merchants. As we navigated through Year 2 of COVID, Shopify kept doing everything possible to help more businesses thrive during the pandemic—and that led to the wild year that was 2021. For the first time, Shopify brought in more than $1 billion in Merchant Solutions revenue in a single quarter (Q4). Only six months earlier, we hit $1 billion in a quarter for total revenue. Shopify’s total revenue for 2021 was $4.6 billion (an increase of 57% year-over-year), and our merchants sold $175.4 billion on our platform—up 47% from 2020. These are each a different way of saying: we saw big-time growth as the world kept embracing independent businesses, and as Shopify continued to become the default choice for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship is on the rise—a record-breaking 5.4 million new business applications were filed in 2021, compared to 4.4 million in 2020, according to the US Census Bureau. And record numbers of people are leaving the traditional workforce to bet on themselves. So what did Shopify do to help all those entrepreneurs in 2021? Let’s take a peek behind the numbers. (Want the numbers-driven earnings report you’re used to? Read our full Q4 and year-end release.) 2021 unpacked Those big numbers above didn’t just *happen*. They’re the result of a global economic shift towards supporting small businesses, pandemic behavioral changes that led to far more online shopping, and Shopify’s unwavering effort to pursue our mission: to make commerce better for everyone. In 2021, we made it easier for merchants to own their own brands, reach more buyers, and build strong customer relationships. We kept building a sustainable internet infrastructure for commerce. It’s a mouthful. But it’s our mandate. We’re constantly trying to level the playing field for entrepreneurs and show them the path forward. That path is not about ecommerce or retail—it’s about commerce everywhere, for anyone. Across every geography and every surface where people spend time—if there isn’t commerce there yet, there will be soon. And we’ll be there too. That’s a core philosophy you saw from us last year, with plenty more to come. In 2021, Shopify: 1.	Powered the creator economy by announcing in-app shopping experiences with TikTok, and launching an integration with Spotify where musicians can monetize their fans with custom merch. 2.	Helped our merchants scale to new heights with 7 companies on Shopify going public, and our global ERP program launching alongside Microsoft and other leaders to help high-volume merchants scale with us. 3.	Kept building our fintech powers with massive growth in Shopify Capital and Balance (read on for more), Shop Pay Installments launching to US buyers, and announcing that Shop Pay will be available to any business selling on Google or Facebook, whether or not they’re on Shopify. 4.	Enabled cross-border commerce for all merchants with Shopify Markets, to make it easier and more accessible to sell globally. 5.	Continued our international expansion, including Shopify POS hardware launches in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. 6.	Made it easier to shop from independent businesses with enhancements to Shop, our all-in-one mobile shopping assistant. We added an analytics dashboard, automated marketing tools, in-app cart and checkout with Shop Pay or Installments, and curated discovery filters. What do all of these have in common? More “cha-ching”: the sound that merchants hear on their Shopify app after every sale. These launches and integrations are designed to help merchants sell more, to more people, in more places.

To develop its 2023-2026 Accessibility Plan, Scotiabank approached its customers, employees, and the public to get their feedback on improvements Scotiabank could make to become a more accessible and inclusive bank to persons with disabilities. "Scotiabank remains committed to learning from our customers and identifying new capabilities to ensure an accessible banking experience for all," said Shawn Rose, Scotiabank's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Champion of the Bank's DiversAbility Employee Resource Group. "As part of the work of our design and engineering teams, we aim to ensure that our websites and mobile apps are built with accessibility at the forefront and are continually evaluated to improve the accessibility of our products, for every future." Scotiabank strives to ensure that all of its customers are able to access barrier free banking with dignity and independence. Over the last few years, the Bank has invested in developing improved capabilities, including: 1.	Engineered accessibility into the core of the Bank's global design system. Accessibility is part of the brand, visual design, and code, and is tested with assistive technology. All new components added to the system are tested for accessibility and conform with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 2.	Established the Enterprise Accessibility Centre of Excellence in 2020, that embraces, embodies, and champions the need for accessible and inclusive practices that treat Scotiabank customers and colleagues with the respect and dignity they deserve. The Bank aims to achieve this by fostering a culture of inclusion through informed strategy, scalable processes, and distributed accountability that puts people with disabilities at the centre: "nothing about us without us." 3.	Established the Global Wealth Management accessibility program to ensure focused and customized efforts are made to achieve digital accessibility goals across the Global Wealth Management business lines. The program has three workstreams: (1) websites, (2) web content, and (3) to support ongoing sustainment of accessibility in digital customer experiences.

Adjusted net income for the first quarter was $2,366 million and EPS was $1.85, down from $2.15 last year. Adjusted return on equity was 13.4% compared to 15.9% a year ago. "I am honoured and privileged to have this opportunity to work with our 90,000 Scotiabankers across our footprint as we look to deliver for every future together for our customers, employees, shareholders and communities," said Scott Thomson, President and CEO of Scotiabank. "The Bank's performance in the first quarter of 2023 reflects both the merits of a diversified platform, and also the continued relative pressure on our profitability given our funding profile. As we look ahead, our efforts on culture, capital allocation discipline and operational excellence will drive a renewed strategic agenda focused on delivering value for our stakeholders." Canadian Banking delivered adjusted earnings of $1,088 million this quarter benefitting from margin expansion, and strong asset and deposit growth, specifically in business lending and personal deposits. Results were negatively impacted by higher provision for credit losses and higher expenses. International Banking generated adjusted earnings of $661 million, up 20% driven by higher net interest income as loans grew 19% and strong non-interest revenues. This combined with continued expense management and lower income taxes more than offset higher provision for credit losses. Global Wealth Management adjusted earnings were $392 million, down 6%. Challenging market conditions drove declines in assets under management, impacting fee income, partly offset by strong growth in the advisory business. Operating leverage remained positive as prudent expense management offset the lower revenue trends. Global Banking and Markets delivered another strong quarter, with earnings of $519 million. Net interest income grew a strong 22% benefitting from a 33% growth in loans. Strong performance from the Capital Markets business was offset by lower advisory revenues. The Bank remained well capitalized with a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio unchanged at 11.5%, despite the impact of the Canada Recovery Dividend. With a continued focus on prudent capital management the Bank's CET1 ratio is expected to continue to strengthen over the year.

This year's theme, "FIRST Energize" is extra meaningful to Enbridge Gas. Students will be tasked with leveraging innovation to support new ideas in energy generation, efficiency and use to see how we can minimize the impact of an increasing demand for energy on our global climate. It's a tall order, and Enbridge Gas is pleased to champion these brilliant young Canadian minds to reimagine the future of energy and help to provide a platform where they can power their ideas forward. "It's exciting to see students take interest in STEM-based fields," said Wes Armstrong, Director of Storage and Transmission Operations, Enbridge Gas. "This year's theme aligns perfectly with real-world challenges faced by the energy industry today. Energy fuels our lives and has the ability to lift people out of poverty, and its advancement must be balanced with environmental stewardship. We look forward to seeing how the students approach this complex issue while promoting the values shared by us here at Enbridge – safety, integrity, respect and inclusion." This year's sponsorship will also support the FIRST Canada STEMathon, which provides an engaging, interactive, virtual opportunity for young women and their allies to gain skills in problem-solving with support from industry mentors. "Energy plays an essential role in keeping our world running. We are delighted to have the continued support of Enbridge Gas which has been a pivotal contributor to the success of thousands of students for many years and in 2023. The financial and volunteer support from Enbridge Gas has helped FIRST Canada to continue with its mission to build leaders of tomorrow and give them the skills they need for a bright future. We are excited to see how our teams will reimagine the future of sustainable energy and power their ideas forward," said Dave Ellis, President FIRST Robotics Canada. "Supporting Ontario's students as they explore opportunities in STEM is a powerful way to ensure our young people can continue to build Ontario as they enter the workforce with the jobs of tomorrow," said Stephen Lecce, Ontario's Education Minister. "Thank you to Enbridge Gas for helping to support Ontario's students as they explore the countless opportunities created with the hands-on experiential learning through events like the FIRST robotics competition."

Air Canada has flown over one thousand Canadians home safely from Maui over several days following the devastating wildfires on the Hawaiian island. When the deadly fires affected Maui on August 8, the access road to Kahului Airport was closed, which necessitated the cancellation of Air Canada’s normally scheduled flight to Vancouver that evening. The following day, the sobering news of Lahaina’s terrible destruction and evacuation became widely known. Air Canada’s global operations nerve centre located near Toronto, Ontario, known as System Operations Control (SOC), which manages and tracks the airline’s worldwide operations 24/7, immediately began putting together a team to focus on the Maui operation. Analysis of global operation, fleet, demand requirements With SOC quarterbacking plans and assessing how best to operate in a rapidly changing environment to get people home, the team evaluated operational constraints, outlooked the demand for seats departing Maui, considered how to balance the overall operation during the busy summer travel season and also handle the Maui crisis. “Being in the summer peak, our fleet was fully committed to our scheduled flying operations. With no hotel accommodations available for crew rest due to the devastation, we would not be able to operate our usual scheduled aircraft, a narrow-body Boeing 737MAX. However, Air Canada’s large and diverse fleet gave us options to look at double-crewing a wide-body aircraft which has rest facilities onboard, to have one crew operate down with the second crew resting, and the reverse on the way back, and also bring back twice as many people on a flight,” said Neale Wisniewski, Director – System Operations Control. “We knew it was important to get passengers home as quickly as possible with the awful situation. After evaluating various options which included tech stops in Honolulu to change crew using smaller 737s and other scenarios, we decided to substitute a narrow body aircraft to one of our YVR-Toronto rotations and assign a wide-body aircraft for the immediate lift needed in Maui over three days,” continued Neale. Comprehensive plan involves cross functional teams across airline Within 24 hours, the plan was finalized and implemented, and a call was held with the various operational teams to get that night’s flight immediately onto a larger 298-seat Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, which would provide extra capacity to bring back more passengers. Coordination across all of Air Canada's operational branches - from crew scheduling, contract centres, catering, security, ground handling and more - was key so that everything worked as smoothly as possible. That included loading extra fuel in case facilities in Maui were compromised, assigning extra pilots to ensure maximum flexibility and sending a maintenance engineer as part of the crew to sign-off the aircraft in Maui. With local authorities requesting that visitors not come to Maui due to evacuations, Air Canada cancelled its outbound flights to Maui to operate a ferry flight, meaning the flight would operate down with no passengers onboard. The flights would return as scheduled flights on a wide-body, to bring back as many passengers as possible. Dynamic and evolving situation Karen Park, Air Canada’s Manager for Customer Service in Hawaii, liaised with the local authorities, other airlines, our ground handling team, the SOC team as well as helping passengers. The largest natural disaster in the state’s history meant that it was a dynamic, evolving situation for several days. “There were so many people at the airport, the roads to the airport were affected, power and communications were down for many parts of the island. We had a crew on layover who we were able to communicate with only sporadically and who we could not get to the airport,” recalled Karen.

In recent weeks, Air Canada has hosted a series of events that aim to provide students and young professionals a glimpse of the wide-ranging careers in aviation and encourage them to pursue careers in this field. The events included an introduction for high school students to the many roles within aviation for young women, as well as a hackathon that invited university students to work alongside Air Canada employees to develop solutions to real-world issues facing the global aviation business. In the hackathon, students teamed up to work together over a two-day period developing potential solutions related to real life challenges in cargo, maintenance and customer experience. “The energy that exuded from those participating in this event was high, and it showed in their deep analysis of the challenge and the ideas they came up with and executed upon. The final pitches were all sophisticated and smart,” said Mel Crocker, Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Air Canada.  “Events like these are a fantastic way to generate new ideas that often give us a running start on improvements, and it’s also a great way to meet emerging talent, I thoroughly enjoyed meeting with all of the students. Through the event, they were able to get a glimpse of what we do every day, and should they be interested in joining our team in the future, they’ve already made some great contacts.” Inspiring High School Students At the same time as the hackathon was taking place at Air Canada’s Montreal headquarters, the airline was also hosting its Young Women in Aviation event, an annual event which returned this year after pausing during the pandemic. This event enabled students over the age of 15 who are deciding what they will study in the future to learn more about multidisciplinary careers in aviation. Air Canada welcomed students throughout the day, and they were able to hear directly from Air Canada’s leaders. They were also treated to an aircraft tour and visit to the Air Canada museum, and visited booths set up by different teams at Air Canada. The goal was to provide the students in attendance with insights into what makes a career in aviation so exciting and showcase career paths where women are currently underrepresented. “This event is significant because we wanted to inspire young women to pursue education and careers in the skilled trades and technologies industry. Being able to connect students with seasoned professionals from various parts of this industry - to share their experiences and provide guidance – is integral to developing this up and coming generation,” said Tony Lowery, Vice President of Maintenance at Air Canada.

Today, the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson, Mr. François Boileau, released Charity Begins with Fairness: More to Explore. This report is in response to the request made by the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, in August 2021, after the Government of Canada’s National Summit on Islamophobia. The Minister asked the Ombudsperson to examine concerns raised by certain Muslim-led charities, engage other registered charities led by racialized communities about their experiences with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and clarify the CRA’s role in national security. In particular, based on the Minister’s request, the examination focused on the following issues: 1.	selection of files for audit by the Review and Analysis Division (RAD) of the CRA’s Charities Directorate 2.	quality of services offered to charities under audit by the RAD 3.	the CRA’s efforts to make its employees aware of their potential unconscious biases that could lead to discriminatory behaviour toward charities run by racialized communities With our Office’s principle of independence in mind, we took the time to listen to all sides, deepen our knowledge, look at the facts, and identify any potential opportunities for the CRA to improve its service to Canadians. To make sure our examination was comprehensive, we met with a variety of stakeholders, including charities and non profits; different experts, including one on bias; Department of Justice Canada lawyers; CRA employees and executives; and academics. Despite our best efforts, we encountered legislative and administrative obstacles that prevented us from having the information we needed to conduct a comprehensive examination and validate the information gathered from all sides. However, regardless of these obstacles, we believe that this report identifies opportunities for the CRA to improve the service it provides to charities. Although we were unable to carry out the full examination, we were able to identify one important area for improvement. Understanding the impact bias can have, the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson recommends that the CRA: 1.	create an unconscious bias training course for CRA employees of the Charities Directorate; 2.	target the course at those involved in the audit process; and 3.	make the course mandatory for all employees involved in the audit process, including decision makers. Background information The Office of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson works independently from the CRA. Canadians can submit complaints to the Office if they feel they are not receiving the appropriate service from the CRA. Our main objective is to improve the service the CRA provides to taxpayers and benefit recipients by reviewing individual service complaints and service issues that affect more than one person or a segment of the population. The Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson assists, advises and informs the Minister of National Revenue about matters relating to services provided by the CRA. The Ombudsperson ensures, in particular, that the CRA respects eight of the service rights outlined in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. To learn more about our open systemic examinations, go to https://www.canada.ca/en/taxpayers-ombudsperson/programs/reports-publications/opened-systemic-examinations.html.

Back in the 1990s, I dropped in on a senior Alberta civil servant intending on an informal chit-chat. It pays to maintain positive rapport with frequent contacts. On this occasion, he wasn’t eager to see me. Smoke emanated from the official’s desk. Only months earlier the provincial government forbade civil servants from smoking in enclosed offices. Seeing an Ombudsman investigator approaching, he slammed his ashtray and cigarette into his top drawer. When caught, we both laughed. I was relieved our relationship was intact. As an Alberta Ombudsman investigator, the least I anticipated was professional respect. Good relations counted if I was to play my part in fulfilling the Ombudsman’s mandate of promoting fair treatment in the public sector. As an independent officer of the Legislative Assembly, the Ombudsman investigates complaints of unfair treatment that impacted someone in the delivery of public services. Senior civil servants tended to be male in those days. Even in the office of the Ombudsman, female investigators were rare, the most common hire being a 50-plus-year-old ex-policeman. Hired at 34 years of age, one of my new colleagues warned me that I was too young for job. The reason why investigators tended to be older was because it was important they be perceived as experienced and credible when dealing with a civil service that operated — quite frankly — by the seat of its pants. Like now, government required a legislative and policy base to operate, but no one felt restricted to a narrow set of rules. In the “real world,” people achieved goals by doing what was practical. Those most opposed to a structured process at the time may have viewed policy as confining. Fortunately, we’ve all evolved since then. In the 1990s, I interviewed two civil servants. I didn’t think their “common-sense” decision was fair. I asked if they had policies. They disappeared to consult with a superior and returned 10 minutes later to reassure me that the department had policies. I asked to see to the policies. Back for another consult with the superior. I could see them, I was told, but it would have to wait because the policy book was in Calgary. Basic concepts escaped many at the time. One regional manager in the social-assistance field had a sign on his wall that read: “In this office, ‘no’ is a complete sentence.” From the perspective of 2022, I am embarrassed to say I didn’t object. I knew the poster was condescending and conveyed the wrong message to his staff and clients. But I didn’t yet have a conscious awareness of fairness principles that would have given me the vocabulary to object. After 36 years promoting administrative fairness, I can tell you today all decisions are reviewable and “no” can never be a complete sentence. The more important a decision is, the more necessary it is to explain how the outcome was reached based on the facts of the case as they relate to legislation and policy. Even formally appointed boards made up of experts can miss the boat on supplying fair reasons. A typical decision concluded: “Based on the evidence above, the benefit is denied.” What evidence? The list of evidence included some that supported the appellant as well as some that supported the government. What did the panel perceive as important and why? Readers can’t be expected to guess. Improvement has taken place. Hiring practices are more inclusive. Creation and adherence to policy is essential practice. In an era of open government, many policies are published online. New hires actually get trained, rather than thrown into the fire to learn as they go. The advance of technology, particularly in the last 15 years, was unavoidable. Decisions that used to take days or weeks can sometimes be instantaneous. While a level of automation may seem to be a sensible, convenient evolution, the good must be balanced with the issues arising. No computer program is complete and can exercise discretion. When an Albertan is denied service, getting personal advice and review is harder than ever. Sometimes template computer responses aren’t enough.

At P&G, we aspire to create a company and a world where equality and inclusion are achievable for all; where respect and inclusion are the cornerstones of our culture; where equal access and opportunity to learn, grow, succeed and thrive are available to everyone. In early 2021, P&G Canada rolled out our Equality & Inclusion Action Plan with a goal to reflect Canada at every level including increasing Indigenous, Black, and French Representation by 2025. Despite the fact that Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Innuit and Métis) make up almost 5% of the Canadian population, 0% of P&G Canada employees self-identify as Indigenous and none of our 8 employee affinity groups specifically represent them. In May 2021, we launched and chartered an Indigenous Professional Network (IPN) as a new addition to our Canadian Equality & Inclusion Action Plan. Our mission is to help P&G fulfill the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Call to Action #92 which makes specific asks of companies to support Indigenous Peoples through fostering mutually respectful relationships, supporting economic opportunities, building representation, and creating an inclusive workplace. Our actions to date have focused on three pillars: Community Engagement: 1.	We partnered with Indigenous Works, a non-profit organization committed to increasing Indigenous engagement in the Canadian economy. We are a member of their Leadership Circle for Indigenous Inclusion, and they have been helping us develop our workplace employment and inclusion strategies. 2.	We donated $100,000 to GlobalMedic, our longstanding partner to distribute P&G hygiene kits to Indigenous communities across Canada who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. 3.	We supported the United For Change Indigenous People’s Solidarity Fund with a $200,000 corporate match, which has now raised over $1 million since inception. This Fund benefits more than 40 Indigenous-led charities from across Canada whose focus ranges from social services to arts and culture. Employee Awareness: 1.	In June 2021, we held our first Canada wide speaker event on National Indigenous People's Day with Dr. Lana Potts, a member of the Piikani Nation and advocate for Indigenous health. 2.	In September 2021, to mark the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation, we held a film screening of "We Were Children" followed by discussion breakouts. The goal was to educate employees on the intergenerational harm caused by the legacy of the Residential School system. 3.	In December 2021, we published a list of Indigenous owned charities and organizations where employees could buy gifts or donate their time and money. 4.	In March 2022, we held a Reflect session based on the book "21 Things You May Not Know About the Indian Act." This helped employees learn about specific issues in how Canadian law treats Indigenous Peoples, and give them concrete actions they can take to support Indigenous communities. 5.	Our employee events and discussions have been widely attended by more than 150 Canadian employees. Recruiting: 1.	We launched the Indigenous Student Internship nationally, partnering with +7 campuses to drive awareness and applications. We have recruited 2 Indigenous Interns, a first ever for P&G Canada. 2.	We developed a partnership with the University of British Columbia for consultation on job postings and go-to-campus strategy. 3.	We were the Spotlight Session Sponsor for Indspire’s “Soaring: Indigenous Youth Empowerment Gathering” reaching 900+ high schools students and teachers across Canada.

Water scarcity affects every continent on our planet. While some people aren’t seeing its impact in their communities, others are facing extreme water stress. In fact, nearly one-third of people already live in water-stressed regions and two-thirds of the global population are projected to be by 2025. We are announcing a major expansion to our Ambition 2030 sustainability efforts across climate, nature, waste, and water that will include making more water available in water-stressed areas around the world. This extended effort includes a global portfolio of water restoration projects which will provide a range of solutions to protect ecosystems, replenish groundwater supplies, reduce the amount of water diverted from essential bodies of water, and improve water quality for the communities and wildlife that depend on them. “Water is one of the world’s most critical natural resources, and something too many often take for granted. For years we have been focused on reducing water use in our operations and innovating to help consumers use less water in the home, but there is much more we can all do,” said Jon Moeller, P&G President and Chief Executive Officer. “Together with our partners, we are expanding our efforts that will improve, manage, and protect water resources in stressed areas that will help sustain people and nature for generations to come.” The significance of these efforts, and P&G’s commitment, is highlighted by a first-of-its-kind goal to restore more water than is consumed when using P&G products in the critically water-stressed metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and Mexico City. P&G’s strategy aims to help build a water positive future by reducing water use in manufacturing, responding to water challenges through innovation and partnerships, and supporting projects in 18 water-stressed areas around the world, including new projects announced today. Restoring Water for People and Nature, Our New 2030 Goals P&G has added two new goals to its already comprehensive program. We will achieve these goals through partnerships with organizations and restoration projects that improve, manage, and protect water resources. Our new goals and projects focus on addressing the water that does not go back to local systems from our operations and, for the first time in our industry, from consumer use of products. We worked closely with the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Program to ensure our new water targets align with the best science and emerging target-setting practices. “P&G’s water target applies a rigorous analytical approach and complements the other aspects within their comprehensive water stewardship strategy,” said Colin Strong, Corporate Water Stewardship Lead, World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Program. “It adds a first-of-its-kind ambition to address water consumption and offers a roadmap for others to adopt targets in the face of our shared water problems.” New Projects for Greater Impact We are continuing to work with on-the-ground partners who have a deep knowledge of local challenges, communities, and landscapes to support solutions that will result in meaningful benefits to water-stressed areas. Today, we’re announcing six new restoration projects throughout the Bear River Basin in Utah and Idaho, in partnership with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation’s (BEF) Business for Water Stewardship to restore natural habitats, improve water quality, preserve cultural history, and enhance irrigation efficiency for local communities and important wetland habitats in the western United States. These projects are in addition to the eight projects we began supporting in 2020 in California’s Sacramento River Basin and the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) System Conservation Project in Arizona, which helps shore up declining water levels in Lake Mead. In total, these projects are expected to restore billions of liters of water for people and nature by 2030 and provide other important benefits to surrounding communities. In the coming years, we will work with new and existing partners to support a diverse portfolio of long-term projects in other water-stressed areas around the globe that improve, manage, and protect water resources.

Today’s investors face disruption across multiple dimensions. At a macro level, uneven paths of inflation, higher rates and recession risks continue to test portfolios in different ways. Disruptive megatrends, from potentially game-changing innovations like artificial intelligence (AI) to an increasingly complex sustainability landscape, are transforming industries and economies. Simultaneously, changing trade patterns, geopolitical gyrations and demographic shifts are reshaping our world. As dislocation in all areas intensifies, striking a balance between risk and reward will not be straightforward. We believe it is necessary for investors to cut through the noise and understand the nuances to manage the next level consequences of recent economic events on investment portfolios. Considerable new opportunities may emerge for those who embrace change, but we believe the risks of being left behind are greater. As companies reshape themselves to compete in today’s challenging macro environment, we see investment opportunities emerging across segments of both public and private credit as well as private secondaries. Businesses are also reorganizing themselves mostly in response to disruptive technology, changing demographics and decarbonization dynamics—resulting in potential financing opportunities in private equity and private infrastructure, green and social bonds, and thematic equities. We believe adaptable active strategies that seek out differentiated exposures across public and private markets can make portfolios more resilient and help deliver alpha in this era of rapid change. Staying ahead in today’s dynamic market environment will likely require agility from companies and investors, but also the technology, data, and networks to potentially deliver exponential results. Success is likely to require a mix of creativity and courage to look beyond convention, but also deep experience gained through previous market cycles. In private equity, for example, the future path to operational value creation will possibly look different than the past, and general partners (GPs) may need to maintain an edge in an ever-evolving market as limited partners (LPs) heighten their focus on manager due diligence. Other market segments, including commercial real estate, are being reshaped by macro forces and secular trends, resulting in wider gaps between buildings on the right side of disruption and those that could be rendered obsolete. Swift and significant advances in generative AI have provided a disruptive force in 2023, and a surge in investor enthusiasm. AI breakthroughs have expanded the ability to synthesize vast amounts of unstructured data, recognize patterns, and produce intelligible output that have real applications for businesses, and may provide a disinflationary force to potentially counter structurally higher inflation. As the technology comes into prominence, albeit at a slower pace than the recent frenzy would suggest, we think it may be vital for investors to consider the far-reaching implications AI could have not only the business landscape, but also on global power dynamics. As the AI story begins, the drive toward a sustainable, inclusive economy continues to transform industries. We view this transition as a driver of both risk to be managed and opportunity to be pursued. Themes and investment approaches linked to decarbonization are becoming increasingly complex. This is prompting essential debate around how the world achieves long-term affordable, clean, and secure energy—and the diverse investment approaches that can help us get there; investors may need a more sophisticated approach to managing climate-related risks. Finally, inclusive growth and the challenge of helping people to lead healthier and more prosperous lives is far from simple. We believe a comprehensive approach across healthcare, education, financial inclusion, and community development is required to drive solutions that improve affordability, access and quality of life. We’re excited to draw on the deep, experience-based insights of our investment professionals across geographies, sectors, and strategies to help you successfully steer portfolios through a remarkable phase of change, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to work with you.

In mid-2022, few outside the artificial intelligence (AI) community had heard of a chatbot called ChatGPT. However, by January 2023—only two months after its November 2022 release by OpenAI—ChatGPT was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.1 This set off a proverbial AI gold rush; application developers, venture capital-backed startups, and some of the world’s largest corporations are all now scrambling to assess the possibilities of a world heavily influenced by generative AI tools.2 While many hedge fund managers are also incorporating AI into their processes, many are more focused on capitalizing on what is widely viewed as a new and more volatile market regime. As of July 2023, the US Federal Reserve had raised the Federal Funds Rate at 11 out of the last 12 meetings—including four straight 0.75% hikes—marking the fastest and most aggressive pace of rate increases since the early 1980s.3  With the Fed Funds rate jumping roughly 500bps in only 16 months (March 2022 - July 2023), hedge fund managers may also be experiencing a similar strategy-altering evolution of the economic environment. The new and evolving macroeconomic environment plays to the advantage of most hedge fund strategies, and we expect it will lead to materially greater expected returns with similar—and potentially lower—levels of risk over the medium term. A Market Environment of Higher Volatility Following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009, both low inflation and meagre economic growth led to dovish global monetary policies and generous fiscal policies. As a result of easy money and ultra-low interest rates, volatility was dampened in most asset classes. Since early 2022, there has been a material increase in inflation that has led to a mostly coordinated attempt by central banks to remove market liquidity and raise interest rates, which has had the expected effect of increasing volatility in most asset classes. While rates and volatility are certainly higher now than in the decade following the GFC, they are reasonable when measured against longer timeframes. Furthermore, despite many economists and market participants believing that the shift to tightening monetary and fiscal policy may ultimately lead to recession, the jobs markets and risk asset performance to date have remained strong. However, despite debate around if and when the economy will have a soft landing or recession, there appears to be market consensus for a prolonged period of elevated macro volatility.4 For most of the past decade, the hedge fund industry faced headwinds to generate alpha as subdued volatility led to fewer trading opportunities and a near-zero interest rate environment hindered the asset price discovery process. Following the tightening of monetary policies, we now have a new macro regime characterized by greater volatility—which should also lead to better investing opportunities for hedge funds. Historically, when equity and fixed income volatility has increased, hedge fund alpha generation has also improved; this scenario occurred  as recently as the second half of 2022. In the mid-2000s, hedge fund alpha generation was about 5%—similar to the average Fed Funds Rate during the period. Hedge fund alpha remained strong during the depths of the GFC and the period immediately following; nimble, opportunistic investors were able to find profitable trades in dislocated markets around the globe. It was the long subsequent period of low rates and low volatility that caused and supported an environment in which there was little economic uncertainty, resulting in low dispersion within asset classes from which hedged investors could profit. There are few ways for hedge fund strategies to generate alpha when all securities trade in sync, equity and bond markets trend based on monetary policy, and volatility remains low.

Earlier this year at our Formation ’23 conference, we introduced the concept of humanized insurance experiences, whereby insurers prioritize the customer experience and carrier-customer relationship by striving to build trust and loyalty throughout the customer lifetime. Humanized experiences happen across every touchpoint of the insured’s journey through the insurance lifecycle. For example, take The Hartford creating an intuitive website that makes it fast and easy for AARP members to get a quote and buy auto and home insurance. Humanized experiences though aren’t just about the pre-bind activities – it of course can and absolutely should occur during the moment of truth in delivering on the promise of insurance, such as Lemonade utilizing AI to process a claim in a record-breaking time of 2 seconds. Each insurer will have their own unique approach to creating humanized experiences depending on their business objectives. To achieve humanized experiences though, I would argue that having the right technology stack in place is critical. So in this post, let’s take a look at how continuous updates in SaaS core systems will make it easier to enable insurers to define the humanized experiences of the future, more so than periodic upgrades. Upgrades are a Blocker to Innovation The industry has long known about the pain of core system upgrades. Back in 2020 when Duck Creek surveyed global insurers, we found that over 53% of respondents were upgrading their IT systems only once every 2-3 years. At the same time, core systems have continued to evolve from legacy mainframes and hosted on-prem, to “evergreen” SaaS; evergreen, meaning the systems are comprised of always up-to-date and flexible solutions that can adapt to your business ever-changing requirements. The initial SaaS core systems have provided a marked improvement over the prior generation of those on-prem systems. With the vendor providing the upgrades, we’ve seen insurers improve their operational efficiency as upgrade projects have gotten faster over time. While these initial SaaS core systems have delivered new features, insurers have had to wait a long time for them, and this approach has not always been optimal for enabling insurers to design humanized experiences. The good news though is that SaaS core systems continue to evolve, and they are becoming even more evergreen than before! How is that? The paradigm is shifting from faster upgrades to no more upgrades, whereby insurers benefit from continuous updates, which include new features, as well as resolved issues and security patches. As an example, and a quick side note, at Duck Creek, we refer to our approach of delivering software as “Active Delivery;” with Duck Creek Claims, we’ve delivered over 250+ new features on a bi-weekly basis (over 80 software builds) in the past two years, while ensuring flexible adoption for insurers by way of feature flags.

Do you have an old mattress lying around your house? Maybe you upgraded to a fancier, comfier option and left your old one gathering dust in the corner of your bedroom. Or perhaps you're moving and can't take your mattress with you. Whatever the reason, the decision to dispose of your old mattress may seem like a no-brainer. But hold on a minute - did you know that mattresses are one of the most difficult items to dispose of properly? There’s a lot that goes into recycling a mattress and as the industry experts in Junk Removal, we’re here to help answer any questions you may have. Below we'll explore why it's so important to recycle your old mattress and the benefits of recycling that come from doing so. Did you know that mattresses take up a lot of space in landfills? In fact, they're one of the bulkiest items, with the average mattress taking up to 40 cubic feet of space. With millions of mattresses being thrown away every year, it's crucial that we find ways to recycle them and keep them out of landfills. When you recycle your mattress, it not only helps with landfill overcrowding but also reduces associated costs such as transportation fees and disposal fees. A mattress can take anywhere from 80 to 120 years to decompose, which means that a mattress that you throw away today will continue to impact future generations... Some of the materials used to make mattresses can be toxic and pollute soil and groundwater, which can have a long-lasting impact on the planet. Mattresses are made of many different types of materials, including foam, cotton, and synthetic fabrics. When these materials break down over time, they can release toxins into the environment. In landfills, these toxins can seep into the ground and eventually contaminate the soil and water. Recycling and upcycling mattress materials can prevent these toxins from being released into the environment, and reduce the risk of contamination. Recycling your old mattress may seem like an extra expense that you could do without, but in the long run, it can be a cost-effective choice. Disposing of a mattress in a dump can incur a fee, and some cities even fine residents who leave their mattresses out for curbside pickup. On the other hand, many recycling centers will take your mattress for free or for a small fee. Additionally, when mattresses are recycled, the materials can be repurposed into new products, which can save on resources and energy. The good news is that we can recycle mattresses! In fact, more than 80% of mattress materials are recyclable, which means that very little goes to waste. For example, the foam in a mattress can be broken down into small pieces and used for making new furniture or insulation for homes. The metal springs from a mattress are melted down and turned into other items such as car parts or even jewelry. The wooden frames can be used as firewood or can be shredded to produce landscaping mulch. Additionally, fabrics from old mattresses can be shredded and turned into stuffing for pillows or blankets. As you choose to recycle your mattress, not only are you keeping waste out of landfills, but you're also contributing to a more sustainable future. The mattress recycling industry is growing, which means that there are more and more job opportunities for people looking for work. Recycling mattresses require skilled workers who can dismantle and sort the materials. Recycling centers are often staffed by people who take apart old mattresses and separate out any reusable materials for resale or donation. The growth of mattress recycling facilities means that there will be more demand for workers with these types of skills, which is good news for the economy.

Hudson’s Bay today announces the expansion of its iconic Zellers brand across Canada, increasing the store’s footprint in cities across the country. The expansion is also marked by further investment in the operating business at large via significant liquidity to enhance the company’s offerings. With the launch of its first e-commerce site and select stores within Hudson’s Bay earlier this year, Zellers is now setting its sights on its next locations. Initially through a series of pop-up boutiques within Hudson’s Bay stores, Zellers intends to open larger footprint stores in some or all of those same locations. The first pop-up will launch at Hudson’s Bay’s flagship Queen Street store in June, with up to an additional 20 pop-ups expected to open in August. These pop-ups will effectively measure customer response in each market to determine the best fits for the Zellers store experience. “We have always said that we will listen to Canadians, and they will tell us where to grow,” says Sophia Hwang-Judiesch, President, Hudson’s Bay. “With these pop-ups, our expansion strategy will be fueled by the interest and feedback from our customers across the country.” At the heart of the Zellers experience is its price philosophy: everyday low prices.

HBC (TSX: HBC) today announced the successful completion of the combination of the retail operations of HBC Europe and SIGNA’s Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH and the formation of the companies’ real estate joint venture. Richard Baker, HBC's Governor and Executive Chairman, said, “This transaction generates substantial proceeds for HBC and is a clear example of our ability to execute on our long-term real estate strategy, centered on capitalizing on our world-class portfolio through opportunistic monetizations, strategic partnerships, and enhancing the credit profile of our tenants. As we look ahead, we will continue to take strong actions to strengthen our Company and deliver value for our shareholders.” Helena Foulkes, HBC’s CEO, said, “Combining HBC Europe with Karstadt creates a stronger, better capitalized retailer well positioned to succeed in the German market. This transaction creates significant value for our shareholders and continues the bold actions we are taking to strengthen our business. Over the past year, in addition to this transaction, we have sold Gilt, sold the Lord & Taylor flagship to WeWork and rightsized the Lord & Taylor business, and put in place new, experienced leaders in key areas.“ Foulkes continued, “Looking ahead, the creation of a stronger operator in Europe allows us to focus our attention on our North American business, ensuring we are making the right strategic decisions to continue to drive profitability and performance and best capitalize on our exceptional real estate assets.” In connection with today's closing, which will be effective at midnight Central European time, HBC has received proceeds of €171 million (exclusive of transaction fees and related expenses), which will be used to permanently repay a portion of HBC’s term loan. Further, HBC expects to receive additional proceeds of €250 million following the sale of a 50% interest in 18 additional properties in Germany expected to close in January. The transactions value HBC’s German real estate assets at a total of €3.25 billion (C$4.88 billion) compared to the Company’s total Galeria Kaufhof purchase price of €2.51 billion (C$3.77 billion) in 2015. Baker continued, “This transaction, demonstrates the significant value of our German real estate portfolio, which exceeds the 2015 purchase price we paid by C$1.1 billion. The German real estate joint venture will continue to seek out opportunistic ways of unlocking value in the future.” HBC and SIGNA Retail have combined HBC Europe’s retail operations and SIGNA's Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH to create Germany’s leading retailer, with 243 locations, 32,000 employees, and pro forma annual revenue in excess of €5 billion. HBC owns 49.99% of the retail joint venture and SIGNA owns 50.01%. In addition, SIGNA acquired a 50% interest in HBC's German real estate assets from HBC and its partners, forming a 50-50 joint venture to own and manage HBC's German real estate assets, including 41 properties owned by HBC’s existing joint venture in Europe. As previously announced, the follow on transactions of the acquisition by SIGNA of a 50% interest in 18 additional properties, as well as the acquisition by SIGNA of the Kaufhof location in Cologne and the Carsch-Haus in Duesseldorf, are expected to occur in early 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. The net proceeds of these strategic transactions, together with the implied value of HBC's remaining interest in these real estate assets, net of debt, totals $8.77 per share.1 HBC investors should refer to the Company’s public filings available at www.sedar.com and at www.hbc.com for additional information and details on the transactions. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in this news release assume EUR:CAD = 1:1.5.

Airbus Helicopters is the leader in Canada for civil and parapublic helicopters with 760+ helicopters flying by 220+ customers, and the Fort Erie, Ontario facility completes, customizes and delivers aircraft and is a centre of excellence for engineering and composite manufacturing. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ontario Provincial Police, Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and STARS (air ambulance service in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), among others, operate Airbus helicopters for their essential missions protecting Canadians. As part of Airbus Defence and Space product portfolio, we have the Military Air Systems that looks after the A330 MRTT and the C295; we also have the A400M. As the provider of the Fixed Wing Search and Rescue Aircraft Replacement (FWSAR) programme, Airbus is working together with the Government of Canada towards the certification of the CC295 Kingfisher aircraft in order to deliver this mission-critical capability for Canada. Airbus has delivered nearly the entire fleet and related training equipment. Airbus is also proud to have qualified for the Strategic Tanker Transport Capability project with its A330 MRTT. With a growing customer base and more than 250,000 flight hours in service, the MRTT has a 98% mission success rate for in service availability in 14 countries. In space technologies, Airbus has provided key systems to five satellites for customers in Canada. Airbus delivered the Sapphire Satellite Bus platform and key sub systems for the RCM Satellites and RADARSAT-2. Airbus also completed various mission definition studies in collaboration with Canadian industry partners for the Canadian Space Agency and the Canadian Department of National Defence. Other Airbus companies and affiliates operating in Canada include NAVBLUE, Airbus Atlantic Canada, Testia, airPro SAR Services and STELIA North America.

Findings may demonstrate a brain and behavioural basis for how nicotine addiction is initiated and then takes hold in early life, say scientists. Smoking is perhaps the most common addictive behaviour in the world, and a leading cause of adult mortality Trevor Robbins Levels of grey matter in two parts of the brain may be linked to a desire to start smoking during adolescence and the strengthening of nicotine addiction, a new study has shown. A team of scientists, led by the universities of Cambridge and Warwick in the UK and Fudan University in China, analysed brain imaging and behavioural data of over 800 young people at the ages of 14, 19 and 23. They found that, on average, teenagers who started smoking by 14 years of age had markedly less grey matter in a section of the left frontal lobe linked to decision-making and rule-breaking. Grey matter is the brain tissue that processes information, and contains all of the organ’s neurons. While brain development continues into adulthood, grey matter growth peaks before adolescence. Low grey matter volume in the left side of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex may be an “inheritable biomarker” for nicotine addiction, say researchers – with implications for prevention and treatment. In addition, the scientists found that the opposite, right part of the same brain region also had less grey matter in smokers. Importantly, loss of grey matter in the right prefrontal cortex appears to speed up only after someone has started smoking. This region is linked to the seeking of sensations. The team argue that less grey matter in the left forebrain could lower cognitive function and lead to “disinhibition”: impulsive, rule-breaking behaviour arising from a limited ability to consider consequences. This may increase the chances of smoking at a young age. Once a nicotine habit takes hold, grey matter in the right frontal lobe shrinks, which may weaken control over smoking by affecting 'hedonic motivation': the way pleasure is sought and managed. Excessive loss of grey matter in the right brain was also linked to binge drinking and marijuana use. Taken together, the findings point to a damaged “neurobehavioural mechanism” that can lead to nicotine use starting early and becoming locked into long-term addiction, say researchers. The study used data from the IMAGEN project and is published in the journal Nature Communications. “Smoking is perhaps the most common addictive behaviour in the world, and a leading cause of adult mortality,” said Prof Trevor Robbins, co-senior author from Cambridge’s Department of Psychology. Annual deaths from cigarettes are expected to reach eight million worldwide by the end of the decade. Currently, one in five adult deaths each year are attributed to smoking in the US alone. “In our study, reduced grey matter in the left prefrontal cortex is associated with increased rule-breaking behaviour as well as early smoking experiences. It could be that this rule-breaking leads to the violation of anti-smoking norms,” said Robbins. Co-author Prof Barbara Sahakian from Cambridge’s Department of Psychiatry said: “The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is a key region for dopamine, the brain’s pleasure chemical. As well as a role in rewarding experiences, dopamine has long been believed to affect self-control. “Less grey matter across this brain region may limit cognitive function, leading to lower self-control and a propensity for risky behaviour, such as smoking.” The study used data gathered by the IMAGEN project from sites in four European countries: UK, Germany, France and Ireland. The researchers compared brain imaging data for those who had smoked by age 14 with those who had not, and repeated this for the same participants at ages 19 and 23. Those with smoking experience by 14 years of age had significantly less grey matter in the left prefrontal cortex, on average. Additionally, those who started smoking by age 19 also had less grey matter in their left prefrontal cortex at 14, indicating a potential causal influence.

The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, found that it may be possible to detect and measure dark energy by studying Andromeda, our galactic next-door neighbour that is on a slow-motion collision course with the Milky Way. Since it was first identified in the late 1990s, scientists have used very distant galaxies to study dark energy but have yet to directly detect it. However, the Cambridge researchers found that by studying how Andromeda and the Milky Way are moving toward each other given their collective mass, they could place an upper limit on the value of the cosmological constant, which is the simplest model of dark energy. The upper limit they found is five times higher than the value of the cosmological constant that can be detected from the early universe. Although the technique is still early in its development, the researchers say that it could be possible to detect dark energy by studying our own cosmic neighbourhood. The results are reported in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Everything we can see in our world and in the skies – from tiny insects to massive galaxies – makes up just five percent of the observable universe. The rest is dark: scientists believe that about 27% of the universe is made of dark matter, which holds objects together, while 68% is dark energy, which pushes objects apart. “Dark energy is a general name for a family of models you could add to Einstein’s theory of gravity,” said first author Dr David Benisty from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. “The simplest version of this is known as the cosmological constant: a constant energy density that pushes galaxies away from each other.” The cosmological constant was temporarily added by Einstein to his theory of general relativity. From the 1930s to the 1990s, the cosmological constant was set at zero, until it was discovered that an unknown force – dark energy – was causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. There are at least two big problems with dark energy, however: we don’t know exactly what it is, and we haven’t directly detected it. Since it was first identified, astronomers have developed a variety of methods to detect dark energy, most of which involve studying objects from the early universe and measuring how quickly they are moving away from us. Unpacking the effects of dark energy from billions of years ago is not easy: since it is a weak force between galaxies, dark energy is easily overcome by the much stronger forces inside galaxies. However, there is one region of the universe that is surprisingly sensitive to dark energy, and it’s in our own cosmic backyard. The Andromeda galaxy is the closest to our own Milky Way, and the two galaxies are on a collision course. As they draw closer, the two galaxies will start to orbit each other – very slowly. A single orbit will take 20 billion years. However, due to the massive gravitational forces, well before a single orbit is complete, about five billion years from now, the two galaxies will start merging and falling into each other. “Andromeda is the only galaxy that isn’t running away from us, so by studying its mass and movement, we may be able to make some determinations about the cosmological constant and dark energy,” said Benisty, who is also a Research Associate at Queens’ College. Using a series of simulations based on the best available estimates of the mass of both galaxies, Benisty and his co-authors – Professor Anne Davis from DAMTP and Professor Wyn Evans from the Institute of Astronomy – found that dark energy is affecting how Andromeda and the Milky Way are orbiting each other.

Within a single week, two cyclones had smashed into the republic of thirteen islands, cutting power to its capital, Port Vila, and forcing residents to evacuate. Such devastation is increasingly common in the South Pacific: rising temperatures create conditions for ferocious tropical storms. Vanuatu is a frontline for humanity’s war on nature. Coastal erosion combined with extreme weather threatens lives and futures right across this low-lying archipelago. Settlements housing more than a quarter of the population are at risk of sinking into the ocean within decades as global heating causes sea levels to rise. Earlier this month, Vanuatu’s Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau said his country is “out of time”, declaring that the effects of global warming “have become existential for Vanuatu”. Wealthy nations choke the atmosphere with carbon. Vanuatu emits almost nothing, yet this developing country is on the brink of becoming a casualty of the climate crisis. Where is the justice? “To emit vast amounts of greenhouse gases, with everything we know about the harm it will cause to so many around the world… it simply cannot be lawful,” says Jorge Viñuales, the Harold Samuel Professor of Law and Environmental Policy at Cambridge. “However, treaties such as the Paris Agreement are carefully drafted to stay legally ambiguous." “But when considered from a wider international law perspective – whether it’s human rights, the law of the sea, or even the UN charter – then nations contributing to climate change are clearly behaving unlawfully. This has never been legally stated.” Viñuales, an experienced practitioner from Cambridge's Department of Land Economy, has advised Vanuatu from the outset on strategic and legal aspects of its initiative to request an ICJ “advisory opinion” on climate change through the United Nations General Assembly. The ICJ, known as the ‘world court’, is the judicial arm of the UN. It has issued opinions on everything from genocide to nuclear disarmament – but it has yet to opine on perhaps the defining issue of the 21st century. Almost four years ago, Viñuales got an email from a group of 27 law students in their final year at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. What had started as a class project was snowballing fast. The students had managed to get buy-in from the Vanuatu government, and a small Pacific law firm based in Guam had taken up the case. "As a law student I know I am in a privilege position to use my knowledge and skills to utilise the law to ensure our people can live a dignified life," says Solomon Yeo, the student campaign leader who is himself from the climate-threatened Solomon Islands. “Any attempt to take climate change to the ICJ would only be successful if its roots were deep enough, so I was really encouraged,” says Viñuales, who spent the 2019 Christmas holidays constructing a draft question. “I remember cycling from my flat to the Lauterpacht Centre in Cambridge, and feeling the basic elements of the text popping into my head.” Lawyers, academics and climate-threatened Pacific nations have been trying to put global warming to the ICJ for decades, including an effort by Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Maldives in 2002, and by Palau in 2012. However, lack of resources and support – both grass roots and diplomatic – have scuppered previous efforts. It was time to try again, and in the intervening years, things had changed. “People are witnessing the effects of climate change,” Viñuales says. "Frustration among the public is mounting as COP follows COP, warnings become increasingly dire, yet the major polluting nations dither and delay. The president of COP28 will be an oil executive. How can the public be expected to buy that?” “There has been a wave of climate litigation since around 2015 that has pushed for the courts to try and remedy some of the political inaction we are seeing." The UN charter requires a simple majority of member states to vote for a resolution to go in front of the ICJ, famously based in The Hague.

As a child in the Netherlands, the University of Cambridge social psychologist discovered that almost all of his mother’s family had been executed by the Nazis during the Second World War. He became absorbed by the question of how so many people came to support the ideas of someone like Adolf Hitler, and how they might be taught to resist such influence. While studying psychology at graduate school in the mid-2010s, van der Linden came across the work of American researcher William McGuire. In the 1960s, stories of brainwashed prisoners-of-war during the Korean War had captured the zeitgeist, and McGuire developed a theory of how such indoctrination might be prevented. He wondered whether exposing soldiers to a weaker form of propaganda might have equipped them to fight off a full attack once they’d been captured. In the same way that army drills prepared them for combat, a pre-exposure to an attack on their beliefs could have prepared them against mind control. It would work, McGuire argued, as a cognitive immunizing agent against propaganda—a vaccine against brainwashing. Traditional vaccines protect us by feeding us a weaker dose of pathogen, enabling our bodies’ immune defenses to take note of its appearance so we’re better equipped to fight the real thing when we encounter it. A psychological vaccine works much the same way: Give the brain a weakened hit of a misinformation-shaped virus, and the next time it encounters it in fully-fledged form, its “mental antibodies” remember it and can launch a defense. Van der Linden wanted to build on McGuire’s theories and test the idea of psychological inoculation in the real world. His first study looked at how to combat climate change misinformation. At the time, a bogus petition was circulating on Facebook claiming there wasn’t enough scientific evidence to conclude that global warming was human-made, and boasting the signatures of 30,000 American scientists (on closer inspection, fake signatories included Geri Halliwell and the cast of M*A*S*H). Van der Linden and his team took a group of participants and warned them that there were politically motivated actors trying to deceive them—the phony petition in this case. Then they gave them a detailed takedown of the claims of the petition; they pointed out, for example, Geri Halliwell’s appearance on the list. When the participants were later exposed to the petition, van der Linden and his group found that people knew not to believe it. The approach hinges on the idea that by the time we’ve been exposed to misinformation, it’s too late for debunking and fact-checking to have any meaningful effect, so you have to prepare people in advance—what van der Linden calls “prebunking.” An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. When he published the findings in 2016, van der Linden hadn’t anticipated that his work would be landing in the era of Donald Trump’s election, fake news, and post-truth; attention on his research from the media and governments exploded. Everyone wanted to know, how do you scale this up? Van der Linden worked with game developers to create an online choose-your-own-adventure game called Bad News, where players can try their hand at writing and spreading misinformation. Much like a broadly protective vaccine, if you show people the tactics used to spread fake news, it fortifies their inbuilt bullshit detectors. But social media companies were still hesitant to get on board; correcting misinformation and being the arbiters of truth is not part of their core business model. Then people in China started getting sick with a mysterious flulike illness. The coronavirus pandemic propelled the threat of misinformation to dizzying new heights. Van der Linden began working with the British government and bodies like the World Health Organization and the United Nations to create a more streamlined version of the game specifically revolving around Covid, which they called GoViral! They created more versions, including one for the 2020 US presidential election, and another to prevent extremist recruitment in the Middle East. Slowly, Silicon Valley came around.

University of Cambridge researchers looked at participants of group-based and teacher-led mindfulness courses, conducted in person and offered in community settings. They say the results, published in the journal Nature Mental Health, should encourage uptake of similar teacher-led programmes in workplaces and educational institutions keen to help prevent mental health problems developing in members of their community. “In our previous work it was still not clear whether these mindfulness courses could promote mental health across different community settings,” said lead researcher, Dr Julieta Galante, who conducted the research while at the University of Cambridge. “This study is the highest quality confirmation so far that the in-person mindfulness courses typically offered in the community do actually work for the average person.” Mindfulness in these courses is typically defined as “the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment”. These courses, formally known as mindfulness-based programmes (MBPs), often combine elements of meditation, body awareness and modern psychology, and are designed to help reduce stress, improve wellbeing, and enhance mental and emotional ‘resilience’. They consist of groups of participants led by mindfulness teachers, who promote reflection and sharing over several one-to-two hour sessions. The body of research into the effectiveness of MBPs to date has been mixed. Cambridge researchers sought to confirm the effect of MBPs on psychological distress ‒ which encompasses disturbing or unpleasant mental or emotional experiences including symptoms of anxiety and depression. They pooled and analysed data from 2,371 adults who had taken part in trials to assess the effectiveness of MBPs. Roughly half the participants had been randomly allocated places on mindfulness programmes that lasted for eight weeks, with a one- to two-and-a-half hour session per week and compared them to those that were not through self-reported questionnaires. The study found that MBPs generated a small to moderate reduction in adults’ psychological distress, with 13% more participants seeing a benefit than those who did not attend an MBP. The researchers found that existing psychological distress, age, gender, educational level and a disposition towards mindfulness did not change the effectiveness of MBPs. Galante said: “We’ve confirmed that if adults choose to do a mindfulness course in person, with a teacher and offered in a group setting, this will, on average, be beneficial in terms of helping to reduce their psychological distress which will improve their mental health. However, we are not saying that it should be done by every single person; research shows that it just doesn’t work for some people. “We’re also not saying you should absolutely choose a mindfulness class instead of something else you might benefit from, for example a football club – we have no evidence that mindfulness is better than other feel-good practices but if you’re not doing anything, these types of mindfulness courses are certainly among the options that can be helpful.” The researchers conducted a systematic review to select previous studies for inclusion in their large-scale analysis. They obtained complete but anonymised data from 13 trials representing eight countries. The median age was 34 years-old, while 71% of participants were women. While mindfulness apps are on the rise, researchers remain unsure whether it is the practice of mindfulness that reduces psychological distress, or the fact that courses involve in-person group-work with a teacher present. “Apps may be cheaper, but there is nowhere near the same evidence base for their effectiveness,” said Galante. “Some apps may say they are evidenced based, but they are often referring to trials that are in-person with a teacher and a group.” The effectiveness of smartphone apps, as well as what happens when people continue to practice mindfulness meditation by themselves, will be investigated by Galante, who has recently taken up a new position as Deputy Director of the Contemplative Studies Centre, at the University of Melbourne.

Efforts to tackle major issues facing the UK, including the nation’s health and climate change, are being hampered because politicians often ignore the existing evidence when setting policies, according to Dame Theresa Marteau, a public health expert at the University of Cambridge. Neglecting evidence is a sure-fire route to unsuccessful policymaking Theresa Marteau Writing in the journal Science and Public Policy, Professor Marteau argues that this ‘evidence-neglect’ is a result of incentive structures that encourage politicians to set ambitious policy goals while simultaneously disincentivising them from implementing the policies needed to achieve them, and of political ideologies and interests that conflict with effective policies. Two changes could mitigate these factors, she writes: engaging citizens more in policy-making so their interests dominate; and increasing the accountability of politicians through legally binding systems for all stages of policy-making. Recent UK governments have set ambitious goals to improve the nation’s health and tackle climate change. These include halving childhood obesity by 2030, eradicating smoking by 2030, narrowing the gap in healthy life expectancy by 2030, and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But, says Professor Marteau, Director of the Behaviour and Health Research Unit at Cambridge, “None of these ambitions is on course. Of course, scientific evidence is just one of many sources of information for policymakers to consider, but neglecting evidence is a sure-fire route to unsuccessful policymaking.” According to predictions, childhood obesity is on track to double, not halve, by 2030. Smoking eradication is on track sometime after 2050, not by 2030. By 2030, the gap in healthy life expectancy between local areas where it is highest and lowest will have narrowed, but by 2035 is set to rise by five years. And the UK Sixth Carbon Budget – a key target towards achieving net zero carbon emissions – is likely to be missed by “a huge margin”. Achieving each of these ambitions requires sustained changes in several sets of behaviour across all socio-economic groups including what we eat, drink, whether we smoke, and how we travel.  A wealth of research demonstrates that achieving such change is difficult, requiring many interventions that change the environments or systems that too readily cue, reinforce and maintain unhealthier and unsustainable behaviours. “There are many possible reasons why these policy ambitions are so far off-track, but chief among them is the neglect of evidence, particularly around achieving sustained changes in behaviour across populations,” said Professor Marteau. “Put simply, these failures are baked-in, given the policies designed to achieve these ambitions are based on interventions that cannot achieve the change required.” Part of the problem, she says, lies in the incentive structures for politicians, which favour setting ambitious policy goals whether as part of achieving election promises, attracting positive publicity or both. But they also discourage the policies needed to achieve them. “Fear of electoral damage plays a role here. Take taxes on tobacco, alcohol, junk food and carbon emissions: these are among the most effective interventions for improving health and the climate, but they are unpopular with the public and so politicians are unwilling to adopt them.” Such policies may not just be unpopular with the public – they may also run counter to political interests and ideologies. Neoliberalism, for example, emphasises a small role for governments in the economy and public policy more generally, and a larger role for individuals to be personally responsible for behaving in ways to achieve health, wealth and happiness. Such ideologies often portray attempts by the government to intervene as ‘Nanny Statism’. Certain industries, too, focus on personal responsibility to discourage politicians from adopting effective policies that conflict with their industries’ interests, such as those aimed at reducing consumption of fossil fuels, tobacco, alcohol, meat and junk food. These industries may cast doubt on the effectiveness of policies that would reduce their sales, as well as lobbying governments to persuade them of the business case for the status quo.

The University joined the Advance HE's Race Equality Charter in 2016 and received the REC Bronze award in November 2019. The Race Equality Charter (REC) is a national scheme that provides a framework for higher education institutions to recognise, investigate and challenge barriers to recruitment, progression and retention of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic staff and students. The work on REC and the institutional action plan to address racial inequalities at the University is coordinated by a Self-Assessment Team (SAT) chaired by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Community and Engagement Professor Kamal Munir and the University Race Equality Champions Professor Esra Özyürek and Dr Ali Meghji. Responses Speaking about the award, Professor Eilís Ferran, Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Institutional and International Relations in 2015-2021, said: “We are encouraged that the University’s work on race and racism has been acknowledged with the Race Equality Charter Bronze award. Applying for the REC award was a complex and difficult journey which invited us to identify and reflect honestly on the impact of structural and other forms of racism on staff and students. “We know there is work to do. We have developed a three-year action plan to tackle any racialised inequalities and embed an inclusive culture. The award is a step towards ensuring that we have the right processes in place.” The work on University’s application was driven by the commitment and expertise of a number of people, including the University Race Equality Champions in 2017-2021, Dr Mónica Moreno Figueroa and Dr Kamal Munir, who said: “We are delighted that the University of Cambridge has been awarded a bronze REC award. The past few years have seen us continue but also initiate difficult conversations across the university on topics many considered awkward and even unnecessary. Both structural and cultural change take time, and all the work done so far represents just the beginning of this arduous journey to eliminate racism. “We are clear that this award is not a reward but the recognition that we have serious issues to attend and that we, as a community, are willing to do so. The bronze REC award strengthens our resolve to keep pushing against visible and invisible boundaries that BAME members of the university have to contend with everyday. We are optimistic about the future.” Speaking on behalf of the Race Equality Network (formerly the BAME Staff Network), former Chair Kusam Leal expressed her optimism that the University is taking race equality seriously both by initiating the conversation about race and through its REC action plan: “The reason for this optimism is that University’s mission is to contribute to society through the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence. The best way to do that is to work toward becoming an organisation that: attracts without barriers the best talent and then retains that talent by being a place where all staff and students flourish regardless of their ethnicity or race.”

Canada has made important international commitments to advance sustainable development and address climate change. In 2015, Canada joined all United Nations (UN) Member States in adopting 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Canada also adopted the goals of the Paris Agreement to mitigate climate change—committing it to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% compared to 2005 levels by 2030—and to achieve net zero by 2050. Yet Canada has had mixed results when it comes to turning its sustainability commitments into action. According to the UN Sustainable Development Report published in June 2022, Canada ranks 29th out of 163 member states in its progress toward achieving the SDGs. Meanwhile, the trajectory to net zero is particularly ambitious given our historical emissions. Emissions have largely stabilized since the early 2000s partly due to technological improvements and because growth has slowed in some industries over the last decade. However, reducing emissions has so far proven difficult across the board. Reaching Canada’s goals will require substantial technological advancements and investments to garner the step change required. At BDC, we believe we have an important role to play in helping Canada meet its environmental sustainability objectives. We are committed to helping entrepreneurs build more sustainable businesses and have set the goal of being net zero in our operations by 2025. We also have a critical part to play in helping bring new technologies to market and ensuring the businesses developing these technologies can find financial success. Our future depends on it: the path to net zero by 2050 depends in large part on opportunities driven by technological innovations. We hope to be the catalyst that can bring in more capital and help the sector flourish in the global transformation that’s now taking place. Canadian sustainability companies are underfunded compared to their peers BDC has a long history of investing in the cleantech space. Our first cleantech fund was created in 2001. It has since been followed up by two other funds. In 2018, recognizing that more needed to be done, we launched the Cleantech Practice, a specialized, dedicated cleantech investment team that manages the $600-million Cleantech Fund I and invested in 50 impactful cleantech companies. That team now manages the $400-million Climate Tech Fund II launched in November 2022. This fund is committed to addressing a chronic lack of private risk capital for the commercialization and scale-up of Canada’s climate tech industry. This brings the Fund’s total commitment to $1 billion since 2018 making it one of the largest, most active investors of its kind in Canada. The Climate Tech Fund II has a heightened focus on technologies that can materially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet, despite these investments and the vibrancy of the Canadian venture capital (VC) ecosystem, there remains a funding gap for companies driving the transition to a more sustainable economy. 1.	Only 5% of Canadian VC investments went into environmental sustainability companies, compared to 14% globally in 2021. 2.	U.S. cleantech firms raised on average three times more VC investment than Canadian firms on an adjusted GDP-basis1. 3.	The Canadian government estimates that the scale of investments required to reach net zero by 2050 is significant, ranging from $60 billion to $140 billion per year on average. A new fund to focus on asset-light, innovative technologies to help Canada meet its sustainability goals This is why we are now launching a new Sustainability Venture Fund. The $150-million fund will focus on software, hardware-enabled software, and other highly scalable businesses with capital- and asset-light business models that are developing sustainability-enhancing technology with the potential to deliver indirect GHG emission reductions. The Sustainability Venture Fund complements the Climate Tech Fund II. The clearest differentiators between the two are the business models of the companies they invest in, and the capital they require. Whereas the Sustainability Venture Fund targets capital-light software businesses, the Climate Tech Fund II focuses on companies that are capital intensive and asset heavy.

Substance use cost the Canadian economy $49.1 billion in 2020. That’s a jump of more than $11 billion between 2007 and 2020 or nearly 12% in per-person costs. The latest available data is part of the Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms [CSUCH] 2007-2020 report released today by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) in partnership with the University of Victoria’s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR). Lost productivity alone cost $22.4 billion or $589 per person in 2020. This includes the value of work lost due to premature deaths and long- and short-term disability. “The fact that lost productivity was the leading category of costs shows that substance use is not just a healthcare issue,” says Dr. Adam Sherk, a scientist at CISUR and a researcher for the study. “Employers can support their employees by developing supportive substance use policies and investing in prevention, harm reduction and treatment programs.” The report analyses substance use costs by four key categories. In addition to lost productivity (45.6% of the total costs), healthcare costs accounted for $13.4 billion (27.4%). Criminal justice costs were $10 billion (20.3%), while other direct costs contributed $3.3 billion (6.7%). These figures illustrate how substance use issues can be found in many aspects of our everyday lives and that solutions are needed to address them. Additional findings from the report include: 1.	Alcohol accounted for just more than 40% of the total costs by substance at $19.7 billion. 2.	The costs of alcohol and tobacco use have diverged over time. Costs of alcohol use increased 21%, while per-person costs of tobacco use declined 20%. 3.	Opioid use cost $7.1 billion in 2020 — the highest of any year examined. Nearly 75% of these costs were related to lost productivity and, more specifically, people dying at an early age from opioid use. 4.	The per-person cost of substance use increased 11.8%, from $1,154 in 2007 to $1,291 in 2020. 5.	Per-person costs of opioids and stimulants increased the most of all substances since 2007, reflecting the increasingly toxic unregulated drug supply and the number of harms related to drug poisoning. 6.	The per-person cost of cannabis decreased 9.1% between 2018 and 2020 following the legalization of its recreational use. The decrease during the last three years was due to reduced criminal justice costs. “There were nearly 74,000 deaths due to substance use in 2020, which was nearly 200 lives lost each day. Alcohol and tobacco account for over 85% of deaths alone,” explained Emily Biggar, CCSA Research and Policy Analyst and a researcher on the project. “Our estimates show not only how substance use affects the healthcare and criminal justice systems but also the ability of people in Canada to work and contribute to the economy. Initiatives across the spectrum of prevention, harm reduction and treatment are needed to improve the health and productivity of people in Canada.” This is the third update in the Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harmsproject following releases in 2018 and 2020. CCSA and CISUR developed the CSUCH report to better understand the societal economic costs and harms associated with substance use in Canada. These regularly updated estimates can be used to prioritize relevant public policies, create initiatives to target the harms caused by substance use, identify information gaps, research needs and refinements to national data reporting systems; measure the impact of changing levels and patterns of substance use, and make changes to policy and societal responses to substance use.

According to the new Canada’s Guidance on Alcohol and Health, 3–6 standard drinks a week represents a moderate risk to your health. After that, the more you drink, the more you increase your risk of seven types of cancer, most types of cardiovascular diseases, liver disease and violence. The guidance recommends no more than 2 drinks a day (per occasion). The bottom line is that, when it comes to alcohol and your health, less is better. Replacing the 2011 Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines, the new guidance supports people in making informed decisions about their health. It meets people where they are at and gives them an opportunity to evaluate their drinking patterns. To help illustrate the risks, the guidance presents a continuum of risk associated with drinking alcohol, allowing people to decide for themselves where they are comfortable being on that continuum. Basically, the more you drink, the higher your risk. The report suggests that: 1.	1–2 standard drinks per week is low risk, 2.	3–6 standard drinks per week is a moderate risk and 3.	7 or more standard drinks per week is an increasingly high risk. 4.	No matter where you are on that continuum of alcohol use, for your health,less is better. 5.	If you’re going to drink, don’t exceed more than 2 drinks on any day. 6.	When pregnant or trying to get pregnant, there is no known safe amount of alcohol. “People have a right to know this information. The concept of a continuum of risk puts power in people’s hands to make their own informed decisions,” said Alexander Caudarella, Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA). Caudarella, who is also a family physician specializing in substance use, continued, “The evidence is clear that every drink counts. It's also clear that it's never too late to make changes. Any reduction in alcohol use can be beneficial. Health professionals can now better determine an individual’s risk and collaborate with their patients to improve their health.” Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Cancer Society, Andrea Seale, agreed, saying, “Canadians need to know there are serious health risks associated with drinking alcohol, including elevated risk of multiple types of cancer. Many Canadians are unaware that alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancer, and most don’t realize they are drinking unsafe amounts. This guidance is so important because it clarifies that the less alcohol you drink, the lower your cancer risk.” The two-year research project, led by CCSA, looked at nearly 6,000 peer-reviewed studies and involved an expert panel of 23 scientists representing 16 organizations. The guidance incorporates findings from focus groups and three consultations with the public and stakeholders. The most recent public consultation received nearly 1,000 survey submissions, all of which were diligently evaluated to ensure the guidance is clear and practical for those using it, including physicians, counsellors, community workers, policy makers and the public.

Dr. Kathleen Ross takes helm as president: AGM highlights In her inaugural address at the CMA’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Aug. 16, incoming president Dr. Kathleen Ross recognized the many challenges facing Canadian health while underscoring the power that physicians have to drive change at the time when it’s needed most. As a family physician, she’s seen the growing hurdles in the system that are preventing physicians from delivering optimal care, consuming their time and sapping much of their energy and joy of practice. “It has become increasingly difficult to stand up for a system that’s falling down around us,” she said. But, touching on her local volunteering and global humanitarian work, Dr. Ross highlighted the importance of getting involved as both an antidote to burnout and to help transform health care. “Your voice, your leadership matter more now than ever before,” she said. “Small individual actions, life-altering impacts.” Looking ahead to her term, she called on members to join her in pressing for change to benefit physicians and patients, including reducing administrative burdens, improving team-based care, streamlining licensure and addressing burnout. “At this critical juncture, the ability of Canadian physicians to guide and lead health system change today will impact the health and wellness of Canadians for many generations to come,” she said. Manitoba physician Dr. Joss Reimer ratified as president-elect Dr. Reimer, currently the chief medical officer for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, will serve as president-elect until she’s installed as president at the 2024 AGM on May 29. A strong advocate for wellness, Dr. Reimer’s goal is for physicians to have the necessary resources, support, respect and autonomy to thrive and find joy in their work. “I want to help create a health care system that allows physicians to provide better care that’s safe, accessible, effective and equitable,” she said in her campaign, “[and] I want that care to be provided in collaborative teams that are diverse, engaged, passionate and valued.” Owing to a change in the date of the AGM from August to May in 2024, the presidential terms of Drs. Ross and Reimer will overlap by three months. They will each serve for nine months exclusively as president and for three months as co-presidents for the period of May to August 2024. CMA leadership highlights progress on Impact 2040 strategy, continued work alongside physicians Members provided input and posed questions to leadership on the actions being taken to address the primary care crisis, enhance health human resource planning, expand health care teams and explore health technology, including artificial intelligence, among other priorities. Discover how our Impact 2040 strategy is driving change: Read our annual report Outgoing president Dr. Alika Lafontaine underscored the CMA’s commitment to drive change to benefit the profession and its continued call to governments at all levels to collaborate on shared health challenges, alongside physicians, provincial/territorial medical associations and national health stakeholders. Board chair Dr. Suzanne Strasberg and CEO Tim Smith also shared upcoming opportunities for physicians to inform the CMA’s work, including consultations on public and private care Opens in a new window, the Canadian Conference on Physician Health Opens in a new window and the Annual Symposium of Physician Leaders of Quebec. As part of the Governance Committee report, members were invited to learn more about and weigh in on a review of CMA governance, including who’s entitled to vote for CMA president-elect and the role of the CMA past president as chair of the Nominations Committee. Members who are interested in providing ongoing feedback on CMA governance are asked to email yourvoice@cma.ca.

Canada’s Veterans often experience physical or psychological injuries as a result of their service — and sometimes both. Over the past several years, medical cannabis has emerged as a treatment area of significant interest to Veterans and their families. In 2022, on the recommendations of their health-care providers, more than 18,000 Veterans were reimbursed for cannabis for medical purposes through Veterans Affairs Canada. A new report, released by the Atlas Institute for Veterans and Families and the Mental Health Commission of Canada, titled Insights into Veteran and Veteran Family Experiences with Cannabis and Mental Health summarizes conversations with the Veteran community from a dialogue series hosted during May and June of 2022. The sessions engaged Veterans, family members, service providers and researchers in a discussion about their experiences and perspectives on cannabis use and mental health. The report found strong interest among Veterans and family members to explore cannabis as a treatment option for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and to have more research and guidance on cannabis use and mental health.  “As one of the more than 18,000 Veterans approved by Veterans Affairs Canada to use medical cannabis, I was keen to participate in this collaborative project, as a community, our knowledge of cannabis is, in large part, based on our own experiences and the shared experiences of our peers. We are missing some of the key scientific and medical research necessary for us to make our own informed decisions about how cannabis may contribute to or jeopardize our other treatments.” said retired Major-General Glynne Hines, chair of the Atlas Institute’s Veterans reference group, and project advisor and moderator for the dialogue series. Additional insights: 1.	Health-care professionals need more training and guidance on cannabis use for mental health. 2.	Cannabis use among Veterans continues to be highly stigmatized. 3.	Veterans need to know more about how cannabis works and interacts with other substances. 4.	The quality and independence of cannabis research matters; Veterans and families want to be engaged in research. 5.	Knowledge, resources, and actions must take diversity among the Veteran population into account. Fardous Hosseiny, president and CEO of the Atlas Institute, said that while cannabis has potential as a tool to manage mental health conditions, more research needs to be conducted to explore the efficacy, impacts, and best practices of cannabis as a treatment option for mental health conditions in Canada’s Veteran population. “What emerged from this dialogue series is that this is a significant topic of interest. There is a need for more research, resources, and guidance not only for Veterans and Veteran family members but for the service providers who work with them, so that collectively they can be best-informed in their decision making around the use of medical cannabis.” Mary Bartram, policy director at the Mental Health Commission of Canada, agreed that this project has shed light on the need for more nuanced research. “In order to honour the Veterans’ and Veteran family members’ diverse experiences and help bridge the knowledge gaps between users and health-care providers, we need to continue to advance evidence-based research hand in hand with the Veteran community.”

Mental Health Commission of Canada marks Mental Illness Awareness Week Oct 3, 2022 During Mental Illness Awareness Week, the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) stresses the need for significant investments in our mental health system. We need to meet the needs and 2022 realities of people with lived and living experiences of a mental health problem and mental illness. In 2012, the MHCC’s mental health strategy for Canada set a spending target from 7 to 9 percent of all healthcare funding be directed to mental health. This target is modest for 2022. 10 years on and a global pandemic later, that percentage point needs to be adjusted. We need to listen to the work of the World Health Organization and OECD who urge governments of high-income countries like Canada, to increase mental health care spending. And we need to listen to people living with a mental illness. Recent polling found that 1 in 3 people living in Canada reported moderate to severe mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Financial concerns, pandemic stress, isolation, and struggles with our health-care system are leading concerns among people living with a mental illness. Age, gender, 2SLGBTQ+, income, and employment status were the strongest predictors of mental health and substance use concerns. 60 per cent of 2SLGBTQ+ youth report moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms and about 40 per cent report symptoms of depression. Although connecting with statistics can be difficult, it is important that we remember the people behind the numbers. We must also care for those care for us. The MHCC recently shared a report on the moral distress and mental health concerns of health-care workers. Alarmingly, we learned that only 60 per cent of health-care workers were confident in the care they provided their patients. While a health-care system under strain is not news to anyone — we need to be mindful of the impacts this will have on access and the quality of services for people seeking care for a mental illness. Financial concerns and inflation are top of mind for many who live across Canada. Our own polling reinforces finances to be one of the top stressors for people living with a mental illness. The evidence is clear mental health needs have increased and funding needs to catch up. Let’s move from awareness to action this Mental Illness Awareness Week and boost investments to our mental health system. Michel Rodrigue President and CEO

Situation critical: Distressed health-care workers in need of psychological support Sep 27, 2022 New research looks to support health-care workers’ psychological self-care and to protect them from moral distress. The report highlights elevated stress levels health-care workers experienced both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Mental Health Commission of Canada, the report, developed in collaboration with the Centre for Studies in Primary Care at Queen’s University and HEC Montréal’s Healthcare Management Hub, reveals 40 per cent of health-care workers are burned out, 50 per cent intend to leave the profession, and just 60 per cent are satisfied with the quality of care they provide. The findings suggest that higher moral distress relates to higher levels of burnout, while increased self-care relates to lower levels of burnout. While almost every barrier linked to the pandemic resulted from staff shortages, respondents pointed out that this was a pre-existing issue that worsened during COVID-19. “Health-care workers are some of the most resilient and dedicated professionals there are, and yet most are at the breaking point. Health-care workplaces and workers stretched beyond capacity after two and a half years of a pandemic deserve top priority from everyone in a position to make change.” — Dr. Colleen Grady, Queen’s University On a positive note, respondents felt that mental health-related stigma had decreased, and their ability to discuss personal struggles with peers had become more widespread and accepted. Health-care workers also provided short- and long-term suggestions to improve support for psychological self-care and protection from moral distress. These include: prioritize psychological health and safety in the workplace through advocacy, strategy, and action make every effort to protect sufficient time off for health-care workers advocate for sustained resources (human and financial) embed appropriate and adequate operational policies and procedures to support health-care workers, such as clearly developed protocols for support (e.g., debriefing sessions after significant events) cultivate an ethical work climate update health human resource strategies “Promoting psychological self-care and reducing moral distress in health-care workers can prevent exhaustion and turnover while increasing quality of care. Proactive actions, like giving voice to employees and including them in decision-making processes, can support an ethical work climate. Transparency and effective communication are also critical for increasing trust in health-care organizations’ leadership” — Dr. Denis Chênevert, Healthcare Management Hub, HEC Montréal The research included respondents from a variety of health-care professions, including nurses (31%), social workers (12%), and personal support workers (11%). Most respondents worked in hospitals (36%), home and community care (13%), and long-term care (13%). In total, 982 health-care workers across Canada were surveyed from December 2021 to February 2022. The study also collected qualitative data from 30 interview participants. “We want to express our gratitude to the health-care workers who contributed to this important research. Its findings show clearly that addressing the well-being of our health-care workforce is a vital task, one that policy makers at all levels can no longer avoid. As the pandemic demonstrates, we need to take care of the people who take care of us when we are at our most vulnerable.” — Michel Rodrigue, President and CEO, Mental Health Commission of Canada.

Our recent ‘Metaverse at work’ research, in partnership with EY, saw sustainability consistently called out as the greatest benefit to businesses. Discover how this translates to different use cases and why sustainability is critical for the exponential potential of networks. The metaverse conjures up many pictures. These usually involve gamers, social networking and interactive experiences. It’s far less likely to create a picture in our minds of present-day working environment. And yet recent research conducted by EY and Nokia shows that the metaverse is already part of today’s business landscape - only 2% of respondents see the metaverse as a buzzword or fad – and it’s already helping to address some of the world’s most pressing environmental and social issues. Sustainability is the top ranked benefit for industrial and enterprise metaverse use cases, both for companies still in planning (41%) and more so for companies that have already deployed metaverse use cases (51%). How is the metaverse helping businesses achieve their sustainability goals? Sustainability is part of businesses Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategies. Businesses measure and report on a range of environmental and social factors to demonstrate their progress towards net zero and equal opportunities. For publicly listed companies, and increasingly, private or limited liability companies, these sustainability reports are made available so shareholders, investors, governments and customers can see their ESG goals and achievements. These goals intersect with the metaverse as many of the digital technologies that are integral to the metaverse will enable more sustainable business operations. From an environmental perspective, advanced connectivity (e.g., 5G private wireless) and digital technologies such as cloud computing, smart sensors, AI and machine learning can help to decrease energy consumption. Augmented/extended/virtual reality, autonomous robots or drones can increase productivity and efficiency (bits per watt of energy used) by substituting physical journeys and processes with virtual ones. All efforts to reduce energy consumption not only help reduce operating expenditure, but they will also help to reduce the level of carbon dioxide (C02) in the atmosphere. C02 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHG), along with other forms of waste, that are contributing to global warming. It's therefore important for companies to reduce the level of GHG coming from their business operations, as well as those emanating from their supply chain. From a social perspective, co-development platforms, digital twin technology as well as the previously mentioned AR, XR and VR are part of creative, virtual toolkits that ensure the right experts can participate in business operations. The human centric social goals that help provide equality of opportunity (regardless of gender, age, education or location) is very well supported in a virtual world. Digital, virtual access can be scaled in a way that physical access cannot. This in turn means more people can have access to training and skills development, but also expert knowledge can be more accessible. For example, during the pandemic, when travel and in person cooperation was limited, Lufthansa developed a Virtual Table Inspection of engine parts. Based on 5G private wireless connectivity, real-time high-resolution video streaming allowed virtual inspection of dismantled parts and enabled joint decision making about inspected components between colleagues spread across a wide geography. This meant that while lockdown measures were in place, Lufthansa could continue to run operations and avoid a backlog of requests. Which metaverse uses cases will deliver the greatest sustainability benefits? The EY-Nokia study covers four industry sectors - automotive; industrial goods and manufacturing; transportation, supply chain and logistics; and power and utilities. It also reviews four areas of the business value chain and maps them to 12 metaverse use cases. Sustainability is identified as one of the top three business benefits in seven of these use cases. For three use cases, more than 60% of respondents ranked sustainability as the top benefit.

The network that connects a hospital must stay up-to-date and simply cannot afford to go down. We discuss some ways to modernize – all while ensuring resilience and security. By Chris Johnson, SVP and Global Head of Enterprise at Nokia As seen in Forbes Mission-critical networks are the underpinning of infrastructure that support the essential functions and services of a business, government, economy, or society – from first responders and hospitals to power grids, air traffic control, and railway systems. Data and applications on these networks demand the highest uptime, performance, and security. Any degradation or outage could have significant – even life-threatening – consequences. This level of risk is why many mission-critical organizations are hesitant to change what’s working “well enough.” But "well enough" will quickly become insufficient in the digital era as other industrial sectors and segments of society embrace Industry 4.0 digitalization. Rather than seeing an increase in efficiency, productivity, savings, safety and sustainability, those that need to catch up will be challenged to embrace valuable applications as operating and support costs increase. A mission-critical operation shouldn’t automatically exclude an organization from experiencing the significant benefits of Industry 4.0 digitalization. So, what’s the best way to modernize and transition to more digitalized and connected business models while ensuring resilience and security? Modern means more Today’s fixed and mobile networks include a range of built-in technologies to maximize uptime, prevent failures and contain security threats. “Fixed” networks based on IP and optical technologies have well-established capabilities to ensure reliability, resiliency, and security while delivering the high-speed, low-latency performance Industry 4.0 applications require. Network operators can supplement IP networking with field-proven Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) technology for fast, secure, scalable, and bandwidth-efficient network services for critical Industry 4.0 applications. Riding over optical transport, the network can offer a wide range of powerful, integrated security features to protect data and ensure regulatory compliance. Industry 4.0 can also protect networks and utilities from climate change-induced environmental events. These networks provide built-in redundancy so that if one or more routes fail, data can still be moved to another, ensuring it reaches its destination no matter what. At the same time, integrated alerts can resolve issues with little downtime. Fiber optics combine the highest available capacity and resilience with any network's most secure transmission foundation. They’re ideal for connected Industry 4.0 infrastructure, enabling everything from stationary robotics to safety mechanisms deployed in hazardous and harsh environments. Mission-critical leaders in the spotlight As a study of how mission-critical operations can benefit from Industry 4.0 technologies, the energy sector provides some strong examples. Power grids are undeniably essential, and outages significantly disrupt day-to-day life. Many US-based consumers and businesses still recall the highly publicized ransomware attack on the Colonial Gas pipeline in 2021 that led to fuel shortages, drove up prices, grounded aircraft, and prompted a national security threat declaration. Industry 4.0 prevents and reduces outages and attacks by providing the foundation for advanced security technologies and applications. With the right digital technologies, operators can monitor their infrastructure and take proactive measures to prevent such incidents. Energy providers can gain much by "going Industry 4.0."  They face increased pressure to balance electricity supply and demand and incorporate more renewable and local sources of electricity while making the grid more resilient to cyber and environmental threats. Modern networks that allow more intelligence to be injected and extracted from infrastructure operations are required, including ultra-low-latency mobile broadband, IP, and optical transport. Industry 4.0 digitalization also opens up new business opportunities for organizations in the sector. In Spain, Red Electrica’s modernized network will support new, Industry 4.0-enabled applications that help to manage better grid assets and distribute energy resources like rooftop solar arrays and storage systems. Transportation is another sector where Industry 4.0 can be revolutionary. In Germany, Deutsche Bahn is working with Nokia to build a standalone 5G network to allow fully automated trains to be controlled in real-time with an intelligent traffic management system, increasing capacity and ensuring safer, always-on-time operations.

Women make up 50% of the population and have had the vote for 110 years, yet the World Economic Forum estimates it will take another 132 to reach full gender parity. How can we close the gender gap across four clear areas? Imagine you’re starting your own travel business. You decide you need to do some market research on customer needs and an old college friend, let’s call him John, offers to help. After two weeks, he comes back to you and tells you there’s a huge demand for physically demanding adventure holidays. You ponder this and ask a female friend, Jane, what she thinks. She’s aware of John’s market research and tells you that while John spoke to her husband, he didn’t speak to her. So, you ask John about his approach, and it turns out he has only spoken to his male friends at the rugby and golf club. Would you base your business case on information like that? No, of course not! It would be ludicrous to pin all your hopes and dreams on what one very specific demographic has to say. And yet, that’s exactly what many businesses and governments do every day. 21st century societies and businesses are still inherently male - dominated and built around a ‘Reference Man’ with a man’s physical attributes. This means that although statistically, women are less likely to be involved in a car accident, they are 50% more likely to die in a crash because the car is not designed to provide them with maximum protection – female crash test dummies were only introduced in 2011. Averages and norms are dictated by a world designed and built by men, which naturally makes it more challenging for women to thrive. Gender parity may not be achieved until 2154 The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 2022 Global Gender Gap Index reviews a range of metrics to measure progress to gender parity. The measures include Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment. And while it notes that the global gender gap is closing, based on the current rate of progress, it will take a further 132 years to achieve full parity across all of them. Despite decades of equal pay law, women are still paid less than similarly qualified male colleagues doing the same job. The average gender pay gap is 10% in the US, 13% in the EU and 15% in India. This is due to fewer women reaching senior leadership or board level roles and, in part, to the fact that in addition to their paid work, many women do unpaid work at home, for example, looking after young or elderly family members. And although this care provides important socioeconomic benefits, this work is not assigned an economic value. Gender equality delivers socioeconomic benefits Gender equality is required for a fair and equitable society and a more sustainable future. It’s also the bedrock of better performing economies and companies. It’s no coincidence that some countries with the greatest gender equality are among the top 20 happiest countries in the world and the top 30 countries with the highest GDP per capita. According to UN Women, a United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, economies will grow if more women work. The presence of women in the workforce increases economic diversification and income equality and often introduces different but complementary skills to the labor force. A 2018 study by consultancy firm PWC claims that increasing the female employment rates in OECD countries to match that of Sweden could boost global GDP by over US$6 trillion. An IMF report found that female presence on the board enhances profitability. It shows that adding one more woman to senior management or on the corporate board – while keeping the size of the board unchanged – is associated with an 8–13 basis points higher return on assets. Given that countries, businesses and communities can benefit and prosper with greater gender equality, it’s pretty hard to justify inaction on gender equality.

Our globe is hyper-connected by an elaborate network of high-capacity fiber optic cables. These strands of fiber, each about the dimension of a human hair, make up the backbone of the Internet and allow us to transmit millions of text, audio and video communications at the speed of light. When this network suffers an outage without warning it sets off a cascading series of costly and complicated actions to quickly restore service and repair the engineering damage. Mikael Mazur is trying to prevent that scenario from happening. The Nokia Bell Labs researcher’s recent field trial demonstrates how communication fibers can also act as environmental sensors that provide an early detection system for network failure. The real-time coherent transceiver prototype deployed in Mazur’s native Sweden can detect vibrations and distortions in the fiber. It can be used for continuous sensing over a 524-km live network aerial fiber that looks to usher in an era of a more versatile and robust network. The technology could also have potentially far-reaching implications beyond the realm of telecom, providing ecological monitoring that would be helpful in measuring climate change in terms of temperature shifts and ocean current swells, and could even detect earthquakes. It is these findings that Mazur will present next week (March 5-9) in San Diego, California at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference, the most prestigious gathering of the optical research community. “What I do is figure out how to extract environmental information from the real-time digital signal processing engine," Mazur explained. “The best way to sense what is going on in the network is to use the network itself.” In other words, Mazur is seeking to “marry” the two primary functions of fiber optics that have generally been distinct from each other: communications and sensing. Fibers to the rescue Fibers are incredibly good vibration sensors so by incorporating this capability into existing communication cables it offers the potential for a self-monitoring system, like the fibers that exist in bridges, buildings and other critical infrastructure. These offer what is called “distributed sensing” that can warn of pending problems from extreme weather conditions and other external factors. When the fibers stretch, it helps tell engineers to be proactive in preventing a break or to reroute data traffic to avert an outage. Some of this technology already exists in the vast submarine cable system. But Mazur’s 524-km aerial cable deployed in harsher conditions last June between the Swedish cities of Gothenburg and Karlstad is believed to be the first one to be wrapped around high-voltage power cables suspended from outdoor poles. “We are trying to design sensing functionality that is compatible with coherent optical transceiver architectures,” Mazur said. “This is very important because we deploy so much fiber to the grid. So, if you know ahead of time that a link is going down, you can have it go down without affecting your network.” This dual purpose provides a potential alternative to purchasing specifically designed, yet extremely expensive, fiber-sensing devices and could offer vendors a competitive advantage at a time when improving speed performance has become increasingly more difficult. Pushing the boundaries of science There is a fundamental limit to the quantity of error-free information that can be transmitted over any communication channel. It’s known as The Shannon Limit – named after famed Bell Labs researcher and father of information theory Claude Shannon. In optical fibers, we’re quickly approaching that theoretical boundary. Since boosting the speed per channel has become so challenging, Mazur says there is a need to improve fiber optics in other ways. Sensing is just one such way to make them more versatile. “Using multiple spatial channels with a fiber could lead to both higher capacities and novel sensing approaches,” explained Mazur. Beyond protecting the network from damage or sabotage, this new function also offers benefits beyond telecom, particularly in environmental monitoring of wind, temperature, currents and more. In earthquake-prone areas of the globe, there are typically more sophisticated seismic instruments in place. But elsewhere, in the deep oceans for example, these sensing capabilities can prove helpful in providing storm, earthquake and tsunami warnings. “From a Nokia perspective, our first interest is to protect the network and ensure reliability and robustness,” Mazur said. “But then there is this secondary use case, which is if we could enable these things, maybe the optical telecommunications network could play an even bigger role in our society than it does today.”

This Nokia Bell Labs researcher says fiber optics can protect the network - and sense the world 3 March 2023 Our globe is hyper-connected by an elaborate network of high-capacity fiber optic cables.

The disruptive newcomer How Amajit Gupta is reshaping the fabric of telecoms by introducing a unique carrier-neutral infrastructure platform. Combined, India and Indonesia have a population of over one-and-a-half billion people – as well as a rapidly evolving business landscape. Almost one in five human beings alive today live in one of these countries, yet businesses in both nations face challenges regarding connectivity. Lack of fiber and frequent cuts lead to unreliability and downtime, holding organizations back in the cloud age. A blank canvas for evolving networks Amajit Gupta saw the issue clearly. The aging network design of India’s legacy telcos meant that the speed they could move to meet digital consumption was not there. This impacted businesses as they struggled to shift to the cloud. And in a world where the cloud is central to digital experiences, growing demand in the country was unmet. Businesses across South and Southeast Asia’s rapidly evolving marketplaces demand 100% uptime, low latency and high levels of control. For that, they require high-quality underlying digital infrastructure (such as fiber networks and data centers). And that’s precisely what Amajit, and his start-up Lightstorm, set out to deliver. With experience across several of the world’s leading networking, telecoms and computing organizations, Amajit knew which pieces of the puzzle were missing. He also knew he had to put his skills and connections to good use, creating something sustainable, long-lasting and effective for his country – and the wider world. “Our mission is to find the white space nobody else finds,” says Amajit. “In other words, solve problems nobody else has solved. “I was very conscious that we had to create a space to expand the market, not step on others’ toes. Therefore, I would imagine our competitors respect us. More importantly, our customers really value us. That gives me a lot of pride.” A business born at the right time But setting up this architecture during the pandemic called for meticulous planning and coordination internally, as well as with partners and government agencies. Amajit describes Lightstorm as being born in the middle of the perfect storm. “We got our license in August 2020. And everyone knows what happened in January of 2021.” he says. “It really was the only time in my telecom career that you could actually build sites with nobody on the roads and hardly anybody in the streets.” In the end, the “white space” to build a new platform in became quite literal. Freedom to grow and connect Lightstorm began with a mission to help enterprises leapfrog into the cloud era. Because Lightstorm was a total newcomer to the market, Amajit and his teams had the perfect opportunity to build a network architecture from the ground up. The start-up launched without any legacy infrastructure or past investments to tie it down, and was able to move, test and grow faster than potential competitors. But that’s not the only factor making the difference for Lightstorm. The company’s design-first approach enables it to co-create solutions with its customers. This blank canvas has also enabled Amajit and his team to build a truly neutral platform, able to serve any enterprise or network partner that needs it. And that has proven good for businesses, the country, and Lightstorm. “Lightstorm has grown exponentially from just a few Solutions, big and small Lightstorm primarily serves organizations looking for ultra-reliable, ultra-scalable, low-latency pathways to the cloud. According to Amajit, such a service had simply never existed in India. “Our first audience is large cloud providers,” explains Amajit. “These guys want to distribute their content deeper into the countryside, along with cities, and get them connected so that the experience on your phone and your home connection is equally fantastic. We built those highways to connect that cloud.” But Lightstorm is also focused on helping enterprises embrace the best of the cloud. “It’s a completely different pain point. Do you know how many cloud and multi-cloud businesses want to scale in and scale out the network or spin up a Virtual Machine (VM) just like this?” says Amajit as he clicks his fingers. “That’s what our new solution Polarin helps CIOs solve for.”

The 5G project pioneer How Yago Lopez is pioneering 5G innovation across Australia despite a complex merger, technological challenges and a pandemic. Curiosity has always driven Yago Lopez to push the limits of what’s possible. He likes to get under the skin of complex technologies, understand how they work – and more importantly, how they can make a positive impact in society. It’s seeing his daily work in action, making a real difference, that gives him enormous satisfaction. Now in charge of the wireless and transmission network at TPG Telecom, his daily work was set to become the biggest challenge of his career yet. In the turmoil of an emerging pandemic, Lopez was handed the task of implementing a 5G rollout and maximizing TPG Telecom’s value in the market. This was made harder still, as he had to achieve results all while delivering network synergies between two merging companies. And all while dealing with the loss of their equipment supplier due to Australian Government regulatory change. A lot was riding on his first move. A world of experience You could say that, when it comes to telecom companies, Lopez has a global outlook and sound understanding of different cultures and country requirements. “At Vodafone, I had the opportunity to move into a global position in Dusseldorf, Germany, traveling the world and providing support for 3G rollout as well as troubleshooting advice.” This was invaluable experience for Lopez, as although similar technologies were being deployed, every country had its own needs. “This opened my mind to a global view of telecom and how different people would approach the technology and take advantage of it.” After years of traveling the world, Lopez decided to remain grounded with an opportunity to become Vodafone Ireland Network Performance Manager and be fully accountable for connecting the country. “It was a great experience going back to being responsible for operations. We achieved great things there, winning for the first-time, public benchmarks on network quality and completing the launch of 4G,” Lopez explains. This success provided him with an opportunity to mimic his Ireland achievements at Vodafone Australia and before long, Vodafone was benchmarked as the best performing network in the metropolitan areas of the country. Three years later – and after a decade in engineering – Lopez set himself a new challenge and moved into the Marketing side of the business. “I thought, let’s try something different and get a little out of my comfort zone. Looking at how money is made, not spent.” This provided Lopez with a 360-degree view of the telecommunications business and valuable experience that would stand him in good stead for what was to come. On this page •	The challenge •	The solution •	The results •	Words of advice •	Further reading Roll back before rollout Enticed back to networks as the newly appointed General Manager of Wireless & Transmission at TPG Telecom, an enormous challenge lay ahead for Lopez – deliver a major 5G rollout across Australia from a market position that was lagging behind their competitors. But before his rollout plans could begin, Lopez was forced to roll back his efforts due to the Australian government’s security ban on Huawei, their main equipment supplier, providing 5G technology for the country’s wireless networks.“When something like this happens, you’ve just got to think forward,” Lopez explains. Layer by layer, you start to build a plan. Our competitors were ahead of us, so we only had one shot to close that gap.” A strategic rethink One hundred percent of TPG Telecom’s network was with their former supplier, so completely rebuilding a 5G network was a major upheaval, but number one priority. With many countries in lockdown due to the global pandemic, supply chains were disrupted, new partner relations were taking place virtually and Lopez’s newly formed team were working remotely. “At times like these, you need a team that will go into battle,” says Lopez. “You’ve got to think where you can find a solution. We have a commitment to millions of customers in Australia, so you can’t feel sorry for yourself.”

The duo designing the future of farming How Case IH’s Christian Gonzalez and TIM Brasil’s Paulo Humberto Gouvea are building the connected farms of the future. Case IH is already a technological leader in Brazilian agriculture with its Advanced Farming Systems (AFS). The company is committed to aiding the development of digital agriculture by working collaboratively to help farmers adopt new technologies. With no single reliable source where farmers could seek help to transform their farms digitally, the team at CASE IH realized that they should be the ones driving it. But how, and more importantly, where? That’s when they came up with the idea of the connected farm. Harvesting the benefits of digital Case IH is fully aware of the benefits of digital agriculture. Technologies such as digital connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT), drones, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics can help make agriculture more sustainable by minimizing the use of pesticides, fertilizer and water. These technologies can further enable precision farming, and Bell Labs Consulting predicts that if 25% of all farms adopted it by 2030, it could lead to yearly yield increases of up to 300 million tons and a reduction in farming costs of up to US$100 billion – critical to helping feed our growing global population. For Case IH, to get the connected farm – a lab to test, learn and gain first-hand feedback from the farming community – up and running, it would need more than just its digital expertise. A connectivity partner was required with the knowledge and expertise to deal with Brazil’s vast agricultural landscape. And that’s when TIM Brasil stepped up. TIM Brasil was already a Case IH partner on an existing agricultural project, and when told about the connected farm project, the company immediately jumped on board. “Our focus on agriculture is important for the country. Agriculture makes up 25% of Brazil’s GDP,” says TIM’s Paulo Gouvea. Connecting a continent TIM Brasil provides the largest mobile network coverage in the country – it’s present in over 5,400 cities, with a commitment to reaching 100% 4G (or 5,570 cities) by 2023. However, these are just urban areas. The next major challenge is connecting the country’s vast rural areas. “I would say Brazil is a continent,” remarks Gouvea. “Brazil has over 300 million hectares of agricultural areas, so we have a big challenge ahead. “For the connected farm, our main challenge was regarding the business model because the normal service providers’ model is based on the number of subscribers per square kilometer, and it doesn’t work when we talk about rural farming communities. In this case, we had to develop a new viable business version to make it feasible,” Gouvea adds. With all the connected machinery and sensors providing large amounts of data, TIM Brasil brought its agricultural connectivity expertise to the project to deploy reliable 4G LTE 700-megahertz connectivity that would not only have an impact on the farming practice but ultimately also the wider community. Location. Location. Location. With the ideal connectivity partner secured, Case IH focussed on looking for a suitable location where the project could be set up. “We wanted to find a location that represents real Brazilian agriculture,” says Case IH’s Christian Gonzalez. The company wanted the aim of the connected farm to demonstrate how rural connectivity increases in-field productivity, even in an already highly productive region. “We didn’t want to create a farm from scratch,” adds Gonzalez. “We wanted to find a partner who understands what we were trying to achieve.” After looking at different regions, the perfect partner was found – one of their dealers in Água Boa, in Mato Grosso state. A small city with around 80,000 inhabitants in the heart of the main soybean production, Água Boa is a fast-developing agricultural area. “Água Boa means ‘good water’ in English,” Gouvea comments. “We chose the area because it’s a place to prove that technology could increase production without any other artificial means. Everything was going for us to test there. We thought, if we can make it work here, then it would work everywhere else in the country.”

Nokia – an unexpected champion in promoting microgrids for our common fight against climate change and energy poverty I was quite surprised when I learned that Nokia was setting up a hackathon-style project to promote microgrids as solutions against climate change and energy poverty. I have been working in the microgrid space for almost a decade now and Nokia was not the typical suspect for such an initiative. I must admit that I have been covering many aspects of microgrids – financing, regulation, also technical and development aspects, and many market aspects. However, the underlying communication infrastructure has not been a major focus of any consulting projects that I was involved in. One reason to participate in Nokia’s #RealAction Microgrid series was also to get new insights into the communication infrastructure side of microgrids where Nokia is a market leader. Real Action – a team challenge Nokia has chosen microgrids as the topic for the second series of its Real Action campaign and has invited some outstanding experts to collaborate and make a positive impact. What really excited me about participating in Nokia’s Real Action: Green, local energy – Microgrids initiative is that I got to work with outstanding industry experts who all brought in their own specific expertise. My teammates were: 1.	Leslie Labruto 2.	Liana Jo Ault 3.	Marilyn Waite and the wonderful host, Jason Elliott from Nokia. Making access to reliable energy sustainable The challenge is huge - 789 million people around the world are without access to any electricity, and millions more lack a reliable energy supply. Significant investments in energy infrastructure are unavoidable, at the same time, it is also clear that the rules of the game have been changing given the fact that more than three-quarters of the newly added power generation capacity is renewable now. Typically, renewables allow for a much more decentralized way of generating power than fossil fuel and nuclear power plants. Microgrids take this one step further as they allow for providing reliable energy on a local – often on a community level. This makes microgrids equally suitable for a local community in remote Africa or in the global North – here mainly for areas that experience energy reliability issues due to lacking grid investments or natural disasters such as wildfires or hurricanes. By integrating locally as much renewable energy as possible microgrids even enable higher renewable shares than on a national grid level. This is why microgrids are even becoming an active driver in our journey toward full decarbonization. Find the right energy mix on a local level Producing energy locally means that clean energy microgrids must make the best use of the renewable energy sources that are available on-site. While geothermal and hydroelectric are extremely site-specific renewable energy sources, wind and especially solar power are accessible almost everywhere on our planet. The problem however is that solar and wind are intermittent energy sources that depend on solar irradiation and wind speed at any given point in time. They do not allow for directly matching the current energy demand. This means that they must be combined with flexible power units such as diesel gensets or energy storage systems such as lithium-ion or redox flow batteries or hydrogen systems. Less is sometimes more Today it is important to test and make proofs of concept for 100%-renewable energy microgrids. However, microgrids can only be scaled up efficiently if they come with a profitable business case, so it is crucial to find the right ratio of renewables for each microgrid solution. Extreme seasonality on the energy supply or demand side would require huge and expensive energy storage systems if the objective were to run a microgrid on 100% renewables. Often it would be difficult to come up with profitable business cases for these 100% renewable energy-based microgrids. For accelerating decarbonization it might make sense to build many microgrids that are not fully dependent on renewables and a smaller percentage that is 100% renewable.  However, one of the guiding microgrid design principles must be to prepare the path towards further decarbonization steps that might be feasible if the costs for renewables and energy storage keep on decreasing.

Paving the Road to Global Markets for Canada Wednesday, May 17, 2023 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Canada’s economy, representing 99% of its businesses.  Yet, they are a relatively untapped source of exporters, with less than 4% of SMEs exporting goods in 2020.  According to a new research report(link is external) by the Standards Council of Canada, standardization may be one of the keys to increasing Canadian SME export. SMEs face many challenges when breaking into the global market. To sell abroad, companies must meet applicable requirements in technical regulations, product standards, and certification within the desired countries. This can be costly and may be particularly difficult depending on whether the technology aligns to the standards and regulations. “We’ve been working with SMEs for many years at SCC, and we have long been aware of the challenges they face,” said Diane Liao, SCC Program Manager, Research and co-author of the report. “They come to us for strategies to help them commercialize and scale up, and we have gotten to see how standardization benefits them firsthand. However, we really wanted to analyze how participating in standards development can advance exportation since this is what will move the needle most for Canada’s growth economically.” International standards have been recognized as an effective way to reduce some of these business challenges. Standards are the written guidelines used to achieve certification and to demonstrate adherence to requirements in regulation. Participating in the development of international standards allows a country to gain economic and political influence by aligning standards development with the country’s interests. This is a crucial first step that can enable more SMEs to access global markets down the road,” said Liao. “By taking a strategic and planned approach to international standards development, Canada can reduce technical barriers to trade that could ultimately bring more SMEs into global value chains.” Drawing on national SME survey results, SCC’s analysis showed that Canada's participation in international standards development has a positive impact on Canada's exports and is associated with engaging more SMEs in international trade. Specifically, participating in an additional technical committee where international standards (such as ISO and IEC) are developed could potentially link to over 200 more SMEs exporting, with an estimated value of 516 million CAD in goods. This is an important piece of knowledge, both for SMEs and for the organizations that support their growth, such as the Government of Canada. Encouraging and investing in Canadian SME participation in standards may mean a boost in Canadian exports.

G is for Google Aug 10, 2015 As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, “Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.” As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make “smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.” From the start, we’ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven’t stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about. We’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant. Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet (http://abc.xyz). I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President. What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we’ll determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole. This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I’ve been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our Internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation -- continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world's information. Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress. Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth.

How to transition your lifestyle into retirement 6 tips to adjust to your new way of life Many of us plan for decades for retirement, often focused around that magic number: age 65. But sometimes life has other things in store – like, say, a global pandemic. It’s been a challenging time for us all, to say the least. But one of the lesser known challenges it has brought is that Canadians are reconsidering the timing of their retirement. A whopping 8 million Canadians feel they’ll have to retire either earlier or later due to COVID-19. There’s a lot of focus on the financial side of retirement planning, but often overlooked is the dramatic lifestyle change, whether you’re retiring earlier, later, or right on schedule. Assuming you have the financial side in place, how can you transition into this big lifestyle change as seamlessly as possible? Here are a few tips to slide gracefully into retirement: 1. Listen to yourself: If you’re headed into retirement, you’ve spent many years with yourself. Hopefully, you know yourself pretty well at this point. So the first step is to simply take this transition at the speed that’s right for you. For some, that might mean jumping on the first flight to Paris the day after your retirement party (assuming travel advisories have been lifted by the time you retire). For others, it might mean reading a few books or binging some shows for a few weeks or months before achieving any big retirement goals you might have. 2. Stay connected: Whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert, we all need some contact with the most important people in our lives. For decades, you may have spent more time around your work colleagues than your family and friends, so you’re used to having a lot of people around. In your new retirement lifestyle, make sure to maintain a level of contact that’s right for you, ranging from occasional coffee chats with a friend, to joining a club. Maybe the pandemic has driven you to become a video chat expert, so it could even mean video chatting with friends and family. 3. Find ways to fill your time that make you happy: For so many years, your job has provided a routine, a sense of accomplishment, and a schedule to fill 8 to 12 hours of your day, depending on your commuting time. You might want to prepare a retirement schedule, or at least a list of things you’d like to accomplish each day. Stick to a regular sleep schedule, have a to-do list, set big and small goals, and have a regular routine. You can find more tips on creating a retirement schedule here. 4. Consider part-time work or volunteering: Both of these options can provide a sense of connection with other people, fill your time, and give you a sense of accomplishment. Whether you want to volunteer at a health care facility, work with animals, or anything you choose, it can be a truly enriching experience. If you’d like to volunteer, but aren’t sure what your options are, there are plenty of ideas and tips for retirees here. 5. Be mindful of your partner: If both you and your partner are retired, suddenly you’re spending more time together every day than ever before, and that can take some getting used to. Psychologist Katherine King offers six tips for marriage after retirement, including: be patient and supportive with each other, don’t expect your spouse to entertain you, and rediscover yourself. 6. Plan for health care: Even if you feel really healthy and active at the beginning of your retirement, it’s important to plan for any “just in case” health scenarios. Your group benefits may end when you retire, so a plan like FollowMe™ Health and Dental Insurance* can help you cover many medical costs, both expected and unexpected, and your acceptance is guaranteed if you apply within 90 days of your work plan ending. With these tips in mind, no matter when you’re retiring, we wish you the best of luck, happiness and health!

Whether animating a single 3D character or generating a group of them for industrial digitalization, creators and developers who use the popular Reallusion software can boost their workflows with the latest update to the iClone Omniverse Connector released this month. The upgrade enables seamless collaboration and expands creative possibilities for creators using NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for connecting and building OpenUSD-based tools and applications. New features include real-time synchronization of projects, as well as enhanced import functionality for the Universal Scene Description framework, known as OpenUSD, which makes work between iClone and Omniverse quicker, smoother and more efficient. The update also comes with bug fixes and improvements. Animating 3D Characters Better, Together Creators across the world are using Reallusion iClone, a real-time 3D animation software, to bring their characters to life. Solomon Jagwe — a 3D artist, animator and award-winning film director — uses Reallusion iClone and Omniverse for his work, which often focuses on environmental themes. Jagwe, who grew up in East Africa, recalls fond childhood memories drawing the creatures he’d see when he ventured into the countryside with his brother. Even now, much of his 3D work begins with a simple sketch using pen and paper. The artist said he always strives to create art that makes a difference. For example, Jagwe created Adventures of Nkoza and Nankya, a video series for educating people of all ages on Ugandan culture. He modeled the sets for the series in Autodesk 3ds Max and Autodesk Maya, animated in Reallusion iClone and composed in Omniverse. “With the iClone Connector for Omniverse, I can easily render my iClone animations in Omniverse and take advantage of the iClone animation tools in combination with the Omniverse Audio2Face generative AI capabilities,” Jagwe said. Jagwe’s entire creative pipeline is accelerated by USD, which acts as a common language between 3D applications and enables sharing full scenes across content-creation tools. “OpenUSD makes it so much easier to transport all the textures and characters together in one place for animation,” Jagwe said. The artist added that he hopes his work inspires other indie filmmakers to bring their story ideas to life using iClone and Omniverse. Another indie filmmaker, Benjamin Sokomba Dazhi, aka Benny Dee, has also mastered the art of animation. He’s landed roles as head animator for the film The Legend of Oronpoto as well as creator and director of the Cartoon Network Africa Dance Challenge. Dazhi uses Omniverse with Reallusion’s iClone and Character Creator to supercharge his artistic workflow. “The main challenges I faced when trying to meet deadlines were long render times and difficulties with software compatibility, but using an Omniverse Connector for Reallusion’s iClone app has been game-changing for my workflow,” he said. Several other Omniverse community members recently joined a livestream to share their workflows using Reallusion and Omniverse. Sync in Style With New Connector Updates The updated Reallusion iClone Connector for Omniverse offers powerful integrations between the two platforms. Users can now seamlessly synchronize their projects in real time thanks to new bidirectional live-sync capabilities. This means changes made in either iClone or Omniverse can be automatically reflected back to the other. Such bidirectional synchronization can be applied to animation-related changes for characters, such as skeletal and morph animation. The iClone Connector also enables enhanced USD import capabilities. Users can now import static meshes, cameras and lights from Omniverse directly into iClone. This improved functionality includes a filter that allows importing assets with optimal efficiency based on their types. See how designers can now preview Omniverse renders in real time while animating in iClone, as they enjoy seamless two-way USD data transfer.

NVIDIA will be showcased next week as the winner of the fiercely contested 3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge for autonomous driving development at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR), in Vancouver, Canada. The competition had more than 400 submissions from nearly 150 teams across 10 regions. 3D occupancy prediction is the process of forecasting the status of each voxel in a scene, that is, each data point on a 3D bird’s-eye-view grid. Voxels can be identified as free, occupied or unknown. Critical to the development of safe and robust self-driving systems, 3D occupancy grid prediction provides information to autonomous vehicle (AV) planning and control stacks using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and transformer models, which are enabled by the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. “NVIDIA’s winning solution features two important AV advancements,” said Zhiding Yu, senior research scientist for learning and perception at NVIDIA. “It demonstrates a state-of-the-art model design that yields excellent bird’s-eye-view perception. It also shows the effectiveness of visual foundation models with up to 1 billion parameters and large-scale pretraining in 3D occupancy prediction.” Perception for autonomous driving has evolved over the past years from handling 2D tasks, such as detecting objects or free spaces in images, to reasoning about the world in 3D with multiple input images. This now provides a flexible and precise fine-grained representation of objects in complex traffic scenes, which is “critical for achieving the safety perception requirements for autonomous driving,” according to Jose Alvarez, director of AV applied research and distinguished scientist at NVIDIA. Yu will present the NVIDIA Research team’s award-winning work at CVPR’s End-to-End Autonomous Driving Workshop on Sunday, June 18, at 10:20 a.m. PT, as well as at the Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving Workshop on Monday, June 19, at 4:00 p.m. PT. In addition to winning first place in the challenge, NVIDIA will receive at the event an Innovation Award, recognizing its “fresh insights into the development of view transformation modules,” with “substantially improved performance” compared to previous approaches, according to the CVPR workshop committee. Read NVIDIA’s technical report on the submission. Safer Vehicles With 3D Occupancy Prediction While traditional 3D object detection — detecting and representing objects in a scene, often using 3D bounding boxes — is a core task in AV perception, it has its limitations. For example, it lacks expressiveness, meaning the bounding boxes might not represent enough real-world information. It also requires defining taxonomies and ground truths for all possible objects, even ones rarely seen in the real world, such as road hazards that may have fallen off a truck. In contrast, 3D occupancy prediction provides rich information about the world to a self-driving vehicle’s planning stack, which is necessary for end-to-end autonomous driving. Software-defined vehicles can be continuously upgraded with new developments that are proven and validated over time. State-of-the-art software updates that evolve from research initiatives, such as the ones recognized at CVPR, are enabling new features and safer driving capabilities. The NVIDIA DRIVE platform offers a path to production for automakers, providing full-stack hardware and software for safe and secure AV development, from the car to the data center. More on the CVPR Challenge The 3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge at CVPR required participants to develop algorithms that solely used camera input during inference. Participants could use open-source datasets and models, facilitating the exploration of data-driven algorithms and large-scale models. The organizers provided a baseline sandbox for the latest state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction algorithms in real-world scenarios.

Yu will present the NVIDIA Research team’s award-winning work at CVPR’s End-to-End Autonomous Driving Workshop on Sunday, June 18, at 10:20 a.m. PT, as well as at the Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving Workshop on Monday, June 19, at 4:00 p.m. PT. In addition to winning first place in the challenge, NVIDIA will receive at the event an Innovation Award, recognizing its “fresh insights into the development of view transformation modules,” with “substantially improved performance” compared to previous approaches, according to the CVPR workshop committee. Read NVIDIA’s technical report on the submission. Safer Vehicles With 3D Occupancy Prediction While traditional 3D object detection — detecting and representing objects in a scene, often using 3D bounding boxes — is a core task in AV perception, it has its limitations. For example, it lacks expressiveness, meaning the bounding boxes might not represent enough real-world information. It also requires defining taxonomies and ground truths for all possible objects, even ones rarely seen in the real world, such as road hazards that may have fallen off a truck. In contrast, 3D occupancy prediction provides rich information about the world to a self-driving vehicle’s planning stack, which is necessary for end-to-end autonomous driving. Software-defined vehicles can be continuously upgraded with new developments that are proven and validated over time. State-of-the-art software updates that evolve from research initiatives, such as the ones recognized at CVPR, are enabling new features and safer driving capabilities. The NVIDIA DRIVE platform offers a path to production for automakers, providing full-stack hardware and software for safe and secure AV development, from the car to the data center. More on the CVPR Challenge The 3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge at CVPR required participants to develop algorithms that solely used camera input during inference. Participants could use open-source datasets and models, facilitating the exploration of data-driven algorithms and large-scale models. The organizers provided a baseline sandbox for the latest state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction algorithms in real-world scenarios.

Score! Team NVIDIA Takes Trophy in Recommendation Systems A five-person global team recounts how it won a prestigious challenge in recommenders, the AI engines of the digital economy. July 12, 2023 A crack NVIDIA team of five machine learning experts spread across four continents won all three tasks in a hotly contested, prestigious competition to build state-of-the-art recommendation systems. The results reflect the group’s savvy applying the NVIDIA AI platform to real-world challenges for these engines of the digital economy. Recommenders serve up trillions of search results, ads, products, music and news stories to billions of people daily. More than 450 teams of data scientists competed in the Amazon KDD Cup ‘23. The three-month challenge had its share of twists and turns and a nail-biter of a finish. Shifting Into High Gear In the first 10 weeks of the competition, the team had a comfortable lead. But in the final phase, organizers switched to new test datasets and other teams surged ahead. The NVIDIANs shifted into high gear, working nights and weekends to catch up. They left a trail of round-the-clock Slack messages from team members living in cities from Berlin to Tokyo. “We were working nonstop, it was pretty exciting,” said Chris Deotte, a team member in San Diego. A Product by Any Other Name The last of the three tasks was the hardest. Participants had to predict which products users would buy based on data from their browsing sessions. But the training data didn’t include brand names of many possible choices. “I knew from the beginning, this would be a very, very difficult test,” said Gilberto “Giba” Titericz. KGMON to the Rescue Based in Curitaba, Brazil, Titericz was one of four team members ranked as grandmasters in Kaggle competitions, the online Olympics of data science. They’re part of a team of machine learning ninjas who’ve won dozens of competitions. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang calls them KGMON (Kaggle Grandmasters of NVIDIA), a playful takeoff on Pokémon. In dozens of experiments, Titericz used large language models (LLMs) to build generative AIs to predict product names, but none worked. In a creative flash, the team discovered a work-around. Predictions using their new hybrid ranking/classifier model were spot on. Down to the Wire In the last hours of the competition, the team raced to package all their models together for a few final submissions. They’d been running overnight experiments across as many as 40 computers. Kazuki Onodera, a KGMON in Tokyo, was feeling jittery. “I really didn’t know if our actual scores would match what we were estimating,” he said. The four KGMON (clockwise from upper left) Onodera, Titericz, Deotte and Puget. Deotte, also a KGMON, remembered it as “something like 100 different models all working together to produce a single output … we submitted it to the leaderboard, and POW!” The team inched ahead of its closest rival in the AI equivalent of a photo finish. The Power of Transfer Learning In another task, the team had to take lessons learned from large datasets in English, German and Japanese and apply them to meager datasets a tenth the size in French, Italian and Spanish. It’s the kind of real-world challenge many companies face as they expand their digital presence around the globe. Jean-Francois Puget, a three-time Kaggle grandmaster based outside Paris, knew an effective approach to transfer learning. He used a pretrained multilingual model to encode product names, then fine-tuned the encodings. “Using transfer learning improved the leaderboard scores enormously,” he said. Blending Savvy and Smart Software The KGMON efforts show the field known as recsys is sometimes more art than science, a practice that combines intuition and iteration. It’s expertise that’s encoded into software products like NVIDIA Merlin, a framework to help users quickly build their own recommendation systems. The Merlin framework provides an end-to-end solution for building recommendation systems. Benedikt Schifferer, a Berlin-based teammate who helps design Merlin, used the software to train transformer models that crushed the competition’s classic recsys task.

AI, Digital Twins to Unleash Next Wave of Climate Research Innovation NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presented a keynote on the topic at the Berlin Summit for the Earth Virtualization Engines initiative. AI and accelerated computing will enable breakthroughs in climate science, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote Monday at the Berlin Summit for the Earth Virtualization Engines initiative. “Richard Feynman once said that ‘what I can’t create, I don’t understand,’ and that’s the reason why climate modeling is so important,” Huang told 180 attendees at the Harnack House in Berlin, a storied gathering place for the region’s scientific and research community. “And so the work that you do is vitally important to policymakers, researchers, and the industry,” he added. To advance this work, the Berlin Summit brings together scientists and technologists from around the globe to harness AI and high-performance computing to create climate information systems of the future. In his talk, Huang outlined three miracles that will have to happen for attendees of the Berlin Summit to achieve their goal of creating Earth Virtualization Engines (EVE). He also described NVIDIA’s efforts in this direction through Earth-2, a highly collaborative effort with the climate science community to create Earth digital twins. The first miracle required will be to simulate the climate fast enough and with a high enough resolution– at kilometer-scale– to predict impacts at local granularity. The second miracle required will be to emulate the physics of climate at high enough fidelity using AI. Generative AI breakthroughs promise new ways of predicting Earth’s climate and enabling real-time interactivity with petabytes of climate data. More importantly, AI is the technology that will help create actionable climate information from raw climate data in myriad ways, unlocking the potential of vast quantities of data to inform decision-making. The third miracle needed is the ability to virtualize massive data interactively with NVIDIA Omniverse to “put it in the hands of policymakers, businesses, companies, and scientists.” The Next Wave of Climate and Weather Innovation EVE is an international collaboration that brings together digital infrastructure focused on climate science, HPC and AI aiming to provide, for the first time, easily accessible kilometer-scale climate information to manage the planet sustainably. “The reason why Earth-2 and EVE found each other at the perfect time is because the premise of Earth-2 is also based on these three miracles”, Huang said. The EVE initiative promises to accelerate the pace of advances, advocating coordinated climate projections at kilometer-scale resolution. It’s an enormous challenge, but it builds on a huge base of advancements over the past 25 years. A sprawling suite of applications already benefits from accelerated computing– including ICON, IFS, NEMO, MPAS, WRF-G– and much more computing power for such applications is coming. The NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is a breakthrough accelerated CPU designed from the ground up for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing applications.  It delivers up to 10x higher performance for applications running terabytes of data. It’s built to scale, and by connecting large numbers of these chips together, NVIDIA can offer systems with the power efficiency to accelerate climate research. “To the software, it looks like one giant processor,” Huang said. To help researchers put vast quantities of data to work quickly to unlock understanding, Huang spoke about NVIDIA Modulus, an open-source framework for designing, training and fine-tuning physics-informed machine learning models, and FourCastNet, an Earth system emulator and predictor that can learn physics from real-world data. Using data alone, Huang showed how FourCastNet can learn the physical principles governing complex weather patterns and accurately predict the thermodynamic structure of storms. A novel application of AI emulators is to tether them to principled physics-based simulations to achieve two goals: rapid exploration and massive compression. FourCastNet can generate many possible weather trajectories when tethered to “checkpoints” created by a climate simulation in seconds to minutes. This enables rapid interactive exploration of massive ensembles of possible trajectories at high fidelity and provides massive data compression. The longer the distance between checkpoints, the larger the compression achieved.

No Programmers? No Problem: READY Robotics Simplifies Robot Coding, Rollouts Startup’s ForgeOS “no code” software, which features NVIDIA Isaac Sim, enables robot programming for non-coders. Robotics hardware traditionally requires programmers to deploy it. READY Robotics wants to change that with its “no code” software aimed at people working in manufacturing who haven’t got programming skills. The Columbus, Ohio, startup is a spinout of robotics research from Johns Hopkins University. Kel Guerin was a PhD candidate there leading this research when he partnered with Benjamin Gibbs, who was at Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures, to land funding and pursue the company, now led by Gibbs as CEO. “There was this a-ha moment where we figured out that we could take these types of visual languages that are very easy to understand and use them for robotics,” said Guerin, who’s now chief innovation officer at the startup. READY’s  “no code” ForgeOS operating system is designed to enable anyone to program any type of robot hardware or automation device. ForgeOS works seamlessly with plug-ins for most major robot hardware, and similar to other operating systems, like Android, it allows running third-party apps and plugins, providing a robust ecosystem of partners and developers working to make robots more capable, says Guerin. Implementing apps in robotics allows for new capabilities to be added to a robotic system in a few clicks, improving user experience and usability. Users can install their own apps, such as Task Canvas, which provides an intuitive building block programming interface similar to Scratch, a simple block-based visual language for kids developed at MIT Media Lab, which was influential in its design. Task Canvas allows users to show the actions of the robot, as well as all the other devices in an automation cell (such as grippers, programmable logic controllers, and machine tools) as blocks in a flow chart. The user can easily create powerful logic by tying these blocks together — without writing a single line of code. The interface offers nonprogrammers a more “drag-and-drop” experience for programming and deploying robots, whether working directly on the factory floor with real robots on a tablet device or with access to simulation from Isaac Sim, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse. Robot System Design in Simulation for Real-World Deployments READY is making robotics system design easier for nonprogrammers, helping to validate robots and systems for accelerated deployments. The company is developing Omniverse Extensions — Omniverse kit applications based on Isaac Sim — and can deploy them on the cloud. It uses Omniverse Nucleus — the platform’s database and collaboration engine — in the cloud as well. Isaac Sim is an application framework that enables simulation training for testing out robots in virtual manufacturing lines before deployment into the real world. “Bigger companies are moving to a sim-first approach to automation because these systems cost a lot of money to install. They want to simulate them first to make sure it’s worth the investment,” said Guerin. The startup charges users of its platform licensing per software seat and also offers support services to help roll out and develop systems. It’s a huge opportunity. Roughly 90 percent of the world’s factories haven’t yet embraced automation, which is a trillion-dollar market. READY is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that provides startups with technical training, go-to-market support and AI platform guidance. From Industrial Automation Giants to Stanley Black & Decker The startup operates in an ecosystem of world-leading industrial automation providers, and these global partners are actively developing integrations with platforms like NVIDIA Omniverse and are investing in READY, said Guerin. “Right now we are starting to work with large enterprise customers who want to automate but they can’t find the expertise to do it,” he said. Stanley Black & Decker, a global supplier of tools, is relying on READY to automate machines, including CNC lathes and mills. Robotic automation had been hard to deploy in their factory until Stanley Black & Decker started using READY’s ForgeOS with its Station setup, which makes it possible to deploy robots in a day.

On Earth Day, 3 Ways AI, Accelerated Computing Are Protecting the Planet April 21, 2023 From climate modeling to endangered species conservation, developers, researchers and companies are keeping an AI on the environment with the help of NVIDIA technology. They’re using NVIDIA GPUs and software to track endangered African black rhinos, forecast the availability of solar energy in the U.K., build detailed climate models and monitor environmental disasters from satellite imagery. This Earth Day, discover five key ways AI and accelerated computing are advancing sustainability, climate science and energy efficiency. 1. Applying AI to Biodiversity Conservation, Sustainable Agriculture To protect endangered species, camera-enabled edge AI devices embedded in the environment or on drones can help scientists observe animals in the wild, monitoring their populations and detecting threats from predators and poachers. Conservation AI, a U.K.-based nonprofit, has deployed 70+ cameras around the world powered by NVIDIA Jetson modules for edge AI. Together with the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, the Conservation AI platform can identify species of interest from footage in just four seconds — and help conservationists detect poachers and rapidly intervene. Another research team developed an NVIDIA Jetson-based solution to monitor endangered black rhinos in Namibia using drone-based AI. And artist Sofia Crespo raised awareness for critically endangered plants and animals through a generative AI art display at Times Square, using generative adversarial networks trained on NVIDIA GPUs to create high-resolution visuals representing relatively unknown species. In the field of agriculture, Bay Area startup Verdant and smart tractor company Monarch Tractor are developing AI to support sustainable farming practices, including precision spraying to reduce the use of herbicides. 2. Powering Renewable Energy Research NVIDIA AI and high performance computing are advancing nearly every field of renewable energy research. Open Climate Fix, a nonprofit product lab and member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, is developing AI models that can help predict cloud cover over solar panels — helping electric grid operators determine how much solar energy can be generated that day to help meet customers’ power needs. Startups Utilidata and Anuranet are developing AI-enabled electric meters using NVIDIA Jetson to enable a more energy efficient, resilient grid. Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is working with NVIDIA to create physics-informed digital twins of wind farms using NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Modulus. U.K. company Zenotech used cloud-based GPUs to accurately simulate the likely energy output of a wind farm’s 140 turbines. And Gigastack, a consortium-led project, is using Omniverse to build a proof of concept for a wind farm that will turn water into hydrogen fuel. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved a breakthrough in fusion energy using HPC simulations running on Sierra, the world’s sixth-fastest HPC system, which has 17,280 NVIDIA GPUs. And the U.K.’s Atomic Energy Authority is testing the NVIDIA Omniverse simulation platform to design a fusion energy power plant. 3. Accelerating Climate Models, Weather Visualizations Accurately modeling the atmosphere is critical to predicting climate change in the coming decades. To better predict extreme weather events, NVIDIA created FourCastNet, a physics-ML model that can forecast the precise path of catastrophic atmospheric rivers a full week in advance. Using Omniverse, NVIDIA and Lockheed Martin are building an AI-powered digital twin for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that could significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to generate complex weather visualizations. An initiative from Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory researchers is instead taking a hyper-local approach, using NVIDIA Jetson-powered devices to better understand wildfires, urban heat islands and the effect of climate on crops.

The New Standard in Gaming: GeForce RTX Gamers Embrace Ray Tracing, DLSS in Record Numbers Uncover the shift in gaming trends as GeForce RTX users fully enable ray tracing and DLSS. April 12, 2023 Creating a map requires masterful geographical knowledge, artistic skill and evolving technologies that have taken people from using hand-drawn sketches to satellite imagery. Just as important, changes need to be navigated in the way people consume maps, from paper charts to GPS navigation and interactive online charts. The way people think about video games is changing, too. Today, 83% of GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop gamers with RTX-capable games enable ray tracing, and 79% turn on DLSS, showcasing the widespread adoption of these revolutionary technologies.1 They’re also widely adopted among prior RTX 30 Series and 20 Series owners; 56% and 43% turn on ray tracing, while 71% and 68% turn on DLSS, respectively. At the core of this story: For any media — from movies and music to maps and magazines — technologies don’t just define the way people create content, they redefine how it’s consumed, ultimately becoming integral parts of its transformation. That’s why it’s essential to consider both ray tracing and DLSS when evaluating an RTX 40 Series upgrade — which is how today’s gamers achieve the best graphics and performance. A New Standard in Gaming NVIDIA introduced neural rendering with its Turing architecture in the RTX 20 Series five years ago. Neural rendering combines two complementary breakthroughs — real-time ray tracing and DLSS — with the shading techniques long a staple of real-time graphics. Powered by dedicated Tensor Cores for AI and RT Cores for ray tracing, RTX and DLSS have transformed the gaming industry. The initial implementations were a first critical step. Back in 2018, 37% of RTX 20 Series gamers embraced ray tracing, and 26% turned on DLSS.2 Fast forward to the present, and the GeForce RTX 40 Series — the third generation of RTX — has established ray tracing and DLSS as the new standard in gaming. Ray Tracing Delivers Unparalleled Immersion Ray tracing performance has significantly improved thanks to advancements like Shader Execution Reordering, cutting-edge Opacity Micromap and Displaced Micro-Mesh engines. This week Cyberpunk 2077’s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode technology preview showcases the evolution of ray tracing into full ray tracing, offering enhanced real-time lighting, shadows and reflections. These innovations enable even the most demanding games to simultaneously implement multiple ray-tracing effects or even full ray tracing, aka path tracing, for unparalleled realism and immersion. DLSS Delivers Significant Performance Boosts Meanwhile, DLSS Super Resolution has evolved to deliver significant performance boosts without compromising image quality. Ongoing neural network updates and model training on an NVIDIA supercomputer — with over an exaflop of AI processing power — continue to improve image fidelity and motion quality. With DLSS 3, AI-powered Frame Generation creates new high-quality frames for smoother gameplay while maintaining great responsiveness through NVIDIA Reflex. AI can now generate seven out of every eight pixels through a combination of Super Resolution and Frame Generation. A Potent Combination This potent combination of third-generation ray tracing and DLSS has resulted in a staggering 16x leap in ray-tracing operations per pixel over the past five years. And where performance goes, PC gamers and game developers follow. Adoption rates have soared, with over 400 RTX games and applications available and more on the horizon. DLSS 3, in particular, has seen a 7x faster adoption rate than its predecessor. The popularity of ray tracing and DLSS outpaces other configurations, such as 4K, which is used by 28% of RTX 40 Series desktop gamers, and 144Hz or higher monitors, used by 62%. As a result, judging a great game like Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS and ray tracing off doesn’t demonstrate how a large and growing number of gamers will experience this game. As DLSS and ray tracing continue to redefine gaming experiences, raster-only numbers no longer paint the picture gamers are seeing. This is only natural because, as PC gamers know, the full picture is looking better than ever.

BMW Group Starts Global Rollout of NVIDIA Omniverse Automaker brings power of industrial AI to its entire production network as part of its digital transformation. March 21, 2023 BMW Group is at the forefront of a key new manufacturing trend — going digital-first by using the virtual world to optimize layouts, robotics and logistics systems years before production really starts. The automaker announced today with NVIDIA at GTC that it’s expanding its use of the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and operating industrial metaverse applications across its production network around the world, including the planned electric vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, that will only start operations in 2025. In his GTC keynote, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang shared a demo in which he was joined by BMW Group’s Milan Nedeljković, member of the board of management, to officially open the automaker’s first entirely virtual factory, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse. “We are excited and incredibly proud of the progress BMW has made with Omniverse. The partnership will continue to push the frontiers of virtual integration and virtual tooling for the next generation of smart-connected factories around the world,” Huang said during the GTC keynote. Omniverse — the culmination of over 25 years of NVIDIA graphics, accelerated computing, simulation and AI technologies — enables manufacturing companies to plan and optimize multibillion-dollar factory projects entirely virtually. This means they can get to production faster and operate more efficiently, improving time to market, digitalization and sustainability. The keynote demo highlights a virtual planning session for BMW’s Debrecen EV plant. With Omniverse, the BMW team can aggregate data into massive, high-performance models, connect their domain-specific software tools and enable multi-user live collaboration across locations. All of this is possible from any location, on any device. Starting to work in the virtual factory two years before it opens enables the BMW Group to ensure smooth operation and optimal efficiency. Virtual Integration for Real-World Efficiencies BMW Group’s virtual Debrecen plant illustrates the power and agility of planning AI-driven industrial manufacturing plants with the Omniverse platform. In the EV factory demo, Nedeljković invites Huang into an update in which the BMW team seeks to include a robot in a constrained floor space. The team solves the problem on the fly, with logistics and production planners able to visualize and decide the ideal placement. “This is transformative — we can design, build and test completely in a virtual world,” said Nedeljković. It’s a lens into the future of BMW Group’s journey into digital transformation. It’s also a blueprint for reducing risks and ensuring success before committing to massive construction projects and capital expenditures. This kind of digital transformation pays off. Putting in change orders and flow reoptimizations on existing facilities is extremely costly and causes production downtime. So having the ability to pre-optimize virtually eliminates such costs. BMW Group Transforming Production Worldwide BMW Group’s production network is poised to benefit from the digital transformation opportunities brought by Omniverse. With factories and factory planners all over the world, BMW has a complex planning process. The automaker uses many software tools and processes to connect people across geographies and time zones, which comes with limitations. With Omniverse, a development platform based on Universal Scene Description (USD), a 3D language that creates interoperability between software suites, BMW is able to bridge existing software and data repositories from leading industrial computer-aided design and engineering tools such as Siemens Process Simulate, Autodesk Revit, and Bentley Systems MicroStation. With this unified view, BMW is powering its internal teams and external partners to collaborate and share knowledge and data from existing factories to help in the planning of new ones. Additionally, the BMW team is developing a suite of custom applications with Omniverse, including a new application called Factory Explorer, based on Omniverse USD Composer, a customizable foundation application of the Omniverse platform. BMW used core components of USD Composer and added custom-built extensions tailored to its factory-planning teams’ needs, including finding, constructing, navigating, and analyzing factory data.

NVIDIA Chief Scientist Inducted Into Silicon Valley’s Engineering Hall of Fame February 27, 2023 From scaling mountains in the annual California Death Ride bike challenge to creating a low-cost, open-source ventilator in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, NVIDIA Chief Scientist Bill Dally is no stranger to accomplishing near-impossible feats. On Friday, he achieved another rare milestone: induction into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council’s Hall of Fame. The aim of the council —- a coalition of engineering societies, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, SAE International and the Association for Computing Machinery — is to promote engineering programs and enhance society through science. Previous Hall of Fame inductees include industry luminaries such as Intel founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, former president of Stanford University and MIPS founder John Hennessy, and Google distinguished engineer and professor emeritus at UC Berkeley David Patterson. Recognizing ‘an Industry Leader’ In accepting the distinction, Dally said, “I am honored to be inducted into the Silicon Valley Hall of Fame. The work for which I am being recognized is part of a large team effort. Many faculty and students participated in the stream processing research at Stanford, and a very large team at NVIDIA was involved in translating this research into GPU computing. It is a really exciting time to be a computer engineer. “The future is bright with a lot more demanding applications waiting to be accelerated using the principles of stream processing and accelerated computing,” he said. His induction kicked off with a video featuring colleagues and friends, spanning his career across Caltech, MIT,  Stanford and NVIDIA. In the video, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang describes Dally as “an extraordinary scientist, engineer, leader and amazing person.” Fei-Fei Li, professor of computer science at Stanford and co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, commended Dally’s journey “from an academic scholar and a world-class researcher to an industry leader” who is spearheading one of the “biggest digital revolutions of our time in terms of AI — both software and hardware.” Following the tribute video, Fred Barez, chair of the Hall of Fame committee and professor of mechanical engineering at San Jose State University, took the stage and  said: “This year’s inductee has made significant contributions, not just to his profession, but to Silicon Valley and beyond.” Underpinning the GPU Revolution As the leader of NVIDIA Research for nearly 15 years, Dally has built a team of more than 300 scientists around the globe, with groups covering a wide range of topics, including AI, graphics, simulation, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics. Prior to NVIDIA, Dally advanced the state of the art in engineering at some of the world’s top academic institutions. His development of stream processing at Stanford led directly to GPU computing, and his contributions are responsible for much of the technology used today in high-performance computing networks.

What Are Large Language Models Used For? Large language models recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other forms of content. January 26, 2023 AI applications are summarizing articles, writing stories and engaging in long conversations — and large language models are doing the heavy lifting. A large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other forms of content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. Large language models are among the most successful applications of transformer models. They aren’t just for teaching AIs human languages, but for understanding proteins, writing software code, and much, much more. In addition to accelerating natural language processing applications — like translation, chatbots and AI assistants — large language models are used in healthcare, software development and use cases in many other fields. What Are Large Language Models Used For? Language is used for more than human communication. Code is the language of computers. Protein and molecular sequences are the language of biology. Large language models can be applied to such languages or scenarios in which communication of different types is needed. These models broaden AI’s reach across industries and enterprises, and are expected to enable a new wave of research, creativity and productivity, as they can help to generate complex solutions for the world’s toughest problems. For example, an AI system using large language models can learn from a database of molecular and protein structures, then use that knowledge to provide viable chemical compounds that help scientists develop groundbreaking vaccines or treatments. Large language models are also helping to create reimagined search engines, tutoring chatbots, composition tools for songs, poems, stories and marketing materials, and more. How Do Large Language Models Work? Large language models learn from huge volumes of data. As its name suggests, central to an LLM is the size of the dataset it’s trained on. But the definition of “large” is growing, along with AI. Now, large language models are typically trained on datasets large enough to include nearly everything that has been written on the internet over a large span of time. Such massive amounts of text are fed into the AI algorithm using unsupervised learning — when a model is given a dataset without explicit instructions on what to do with it. Through this method, a large language model learns words, as well as the relationships between and concepts behind them. It could, for example, learn to differentiate the two meanings of the word “bark” based on its context. And just as a person who masters a language can guess what might come next in a sentence or paragraph — or even come up with new words or concepts themselves — a large language model can apply its knowledge to predict and generate content. Large language models can also be customized for specific use cases, including through techniques like fine-tuning or prompt-tuning, which is the process of feeding the model small bits of data to focus on, to train it for a specific application. Thanks to its computational efficiency in processing sequences in parallel, the transformer model architecture is the building block behind the largest and most powerful LLMs. Large language models are unlocking new possibilities in areas such as search engines, natural language processing, healthcare, robotics and code generation. The popular ChatGPT AI chatbot is one application of a large language model. It can be used for a myriad of natural language processing tasks.

Canada Post segment reports $548-million loss before tax for 2022 Increased competition in the parcel delivery market impacted volumes and revenue OTTAWA – Canada Post recorded a loss before tax of $548 million in 2022, as growing competition in the parcel delivery sector, combined with economic uncertainty and reduced consumer spending, negatively affected parcel volumes and revenue. The Corporation’s 2022 loss before tax widened by $58 million from a loss before tax of $490 million in 2021. Total revenue declined by $167 million, or 1.9 per cent1, from the previous year. While Parcels revenue declined from 2021, the line of business ended 2022 with stronger revenue than before the pandemic started. Transaction Mail volumes continued to erode. Direct Marketing revenue and volumes slowly recovered from the prior year. Canada Post's overall cost of operations fell by 0.8 per cent from the previous year. This was largely due to lower employee benefits driven by higher discount rates, and reduced labour costs related to lower parcel volumes. As the business shifts from mail to parcels, pressure on costs continues. The Corporation is making strategic investments to improve service and tracking, enable its network, increase capacity and enhance the customer experience. With an obligation to deliver to all Canadian addresses, the continued growth of the Canada Post network added to costs in 2022. Addresses increased by approximately 219,000 during the year. The ecommerce parcel delivery sector in Canada has transformed over the past few years, as significant growth in online shopping resulted in increased competition. While online shopping has slowed partly due to economic uncertainty and the rising cost of living, the ecommerce market is expected to more than double over the next decade. With parcels representing approximately half of Canada Post’s revenue, the Corporation is investing to better position itself in a competitive market and ensure the postal service continues to be a valued delivery partner. While the immediate focus must be on critical investments and improvements to meet the changing needs of Canadians and Canadian businesses, financial self-sustainability remains the Corporation’s medium- to long-term goal. Canada Post has a long-standing mandate to be financially self-sustainable while serving all Canadians. Parcels In 2022, Parcels revenue declined by $99 million, or 2.3 per cent, and volumes fell by 75 million pieces, or 20.4 per cent, compared to 2021, when volumes remained elevated due to COVID-19. Increased competition, coupled with the return to in-store shopping and lower consumer spending, negatively affected Parcels volumes in 2022. Limited shipping capacity out of China and supply chain disruptions also impacted inbound parcels. The Corporation proactively managed its commercial customer and product mix to help offset the decline in revenue. Canada Post continued to invest in capacity to position its Parcels business for long-term growth. Transaction Mail Transaction Mail revenue declined by $70 million, or 2.4 per cent, as volumes fell by 165 million pieces, or 6.3 per cent, compared to 2021. Revenue and volumes declined from higher levels in 2021, when the line of business benefitted from the 2021 Census and federal election mailings. Maintaining regulated stamp prices at 2020 levels throughout 2022 also negatively affected revenues. Transaction Mail continues to erode as consumers and mailers migrate to digital channels. Direct Marketing Direct Marketing revenue increased by $32 million, or 3.9 per cent, as volumes rose by 67 million pieces, or 2.1 per cent, from 2021. Personalized Mail™ and Neighbourhood Mail™ revenues and volumes increased slightly at the start of 2022 as businesses resumed marketing campaigns amid the post-lockdown return to in-person shopping. Campaigns then slowed, however, as economic uncertainty rose and businesses pulled back on spending. Declining consumer spending and global paper shortages also negatively impacted demand for marketing campaigns. Publications Mail revenue and volumes declined slightly due to the timing of mailing campaigns and a continued drop in paper subscriptions. The Corporation continues to invest in Direct Marketing products to maximize their value proposition and integrate them with digital experiences.

While I’m only a week or so into using the iOS 17 beta — I’m getting too old for this shit? — it’s already pretty clear what the standout feature is: StandBy. This is the new mode where when you have your iPhone in landscape mode whilst charging, it displays a new data presentation style, geared towards far more glanceable information. Things like the time, the date, the weather, etc. It sounds mundane. And it is. But it’s also brilliant. The obvious use case is as a bed-side clock. And it’s good for that. While you might worry about having a screen beaming its backlight in your face all night, Apple has created a smart mode (“Night Mode”) that shifts all the visuals to red. It looks like you’re on a submarine. Or like it’s DEFCON 1. It’s cool — albeit slightly masculine? It’s clearly borrowed from the “Night Mode” on the new Apple Watch Ultra — more on this in a bit — but it’s arguably more useful here. But this bed-side use case also begs the obvious: Apple doesn’t sell a dock that currently easily allows for you to enter this mode. Third-party accessory makers do — I have this one by Belkin, which is great (though pricey) — but it’s sort of wild that Apple has no way to do this beyond propping your iPhone up at an angle while charging. It’s so overt — and the new functionality is so good — that I have to believe we’ll see a new iPhone charger announced alongside the iPhone 15 in a few weeks. My guess is that it will be a wireless charging “puck” on a stand. Maybe they’ll even sell one like Belkin’s which lets you charge the Apple Watch as well — eat your never-shipped heart out, AirPower. I mean, they have to do this. Again, the third-party docks work well, but Apple can’t just leave this money on the table. It’s not in their nature. One other option would be for Apple to offer a new type of case which allows you to prop the device up. This is actually the type of “case” I’ve been using for the past year or so. I say “case” because it’s not actually a case, it’s more like a magnetic wallet that attaches via MagSafe. But it works well to both elevate the camera system off any table when folded flat, and to prop up the iPhone, either vertically or horizontally, when folded out. Apple should replace their current Wallet product with something like this. Because again, it would also allow you to enter StandBy mode when charging (in this case, with a cable). I actually love this ability when sitting at my desk. I prop up my iPhone horizontally with this case while it’s plugged in via a Lightning cable (and soon, USB-C, with the iPhone 15). One of the StandBy widgets allows you to control music via a nice, large interface purpose built for StandBy mode. I love this. It’s both a visually pleasing way to see what you’re listening to, while also giving you easy-to-tap controls for the music. You too can DJ while working. But the best part is the album artwork, which is nice and large — something I’ve long complained about a lack of focus on with all the digital music services — and has a nice little flip animation as tracks change. When paired with a HomePod (or AirPods), it’s all brilliant. Yes, if you’re using your computer, you could just open Apple Music and listen to music there, but again, this is a far better UI and experience. It’s great. I’m reminded of the old school iTunes interface for the iMac — you know the one that came with a remote. Because of said accessory, Apple created a new UI mode to be able to see media from afar. I often miss that interface. StandBy almost gets us back there, in a way.

It’s a situation no one wants to face. You need a medication or health product, but you can’t find it anywhere. The reason? A shortage. Many of us have become all too familiar with drug shortages, which have been increasing in the last few years. Global supply constraints, manufacturing issues, difficulties in accessing raw materials and the COVID-19 pandemic are some of the key reasons behind this increase. Fortunately, Health Canada experts have been working hard to address shortages. Stephanie Di Trapani, Director of Health Canada’s Drug Shortages Division, has made it her personal mission to detect, assess, analyse, mitigate, and monitor shortages. And she’s been doing exactly that in various roles for more than 10 years. Building a foundation In 2012, a critical national shortage of painkillers, anesthetics, antibiotics, and hospital injectable products had severe consequences. The impact was widespread with many people not being able to get the medications they needed, and some surgeries being postponed or even cancelled. “Up until this point, Canada hadn’t truly faced a critical national shortage of that scope. We were in uncharted territory. Back then, Health Canada’s focus was mostly on ensuring drugs were safe, effective and of good quality. This shortage showed us that we needed to be more proactive and increase coordination between all stakeholders,” explains Ms. Di Trapani. In response to that shortage, Health Canada helped create the Multi-Stakeholder Steering Committee on Drug Shortages (MSSC) in 2012. This committee, co-chaired by Health Canada, brings together federal, provincial, and territorial governments, and health professional, patient and industry associations. It was formed to improve information sharing and to identify actions to manage and mitigate drug shortages in Canada. Increasing transparency The creation of the committee was helpful in improving responses to shortages. That being said, Ms. Di Trapani and her team still needed more information from manufacturers to prevent and mitigate shortages. “Getting the facts early is key. The sooner manufacturers share the information we need, the greater the impact we can have to reduce a shortage,” says Ms. Di Trapani. Recognizing this information gap, Ms. Trapani and her team worked on new regulations requiring that manufacturers report existing and anticipated shortages as well as discontinuations of certain prescription medications. In fact, Canada was one of the first countries to implement shortage reporting regulations. Thanks to these regulations, Health Canada has improved its capacity to: 1.	assess the supply and demand situation of a drug; 2.	identify options to mitigate the impact of drug shortages, such as permitting the importation of foreign-authorized supply, extending the expiry date of products, and where possible assisting with the acceleration of deliveries of resupplies; 3.	ensure there is timely and effective communication between all potentially impacted groups; and, 4.	work with stakeholders on strategies to prevent shortages and strengthen the supply chain. Constantly improving Unfortunately, not all shortages can be avoided, mitigated, or solved as quickly as we would like due to their complexity and factors beyond our control. Last fall, Canada experienced a shortage of children’s analgesics (acetaminophen and ibuprofen) and antibiotics. Unprecedented demand caused a shortage that lasted upwards of eight months. Ms. Di Trapani and her team worked around the clock to find solutions. These included working with manufacturers to secure supplies from other countries, contacting pharmacists to help manage supplies and working with health professionals to provide information and advice to parents and caregivers who were affected by this shortage. “It was quite a challenge. But the systems we put in place over the past decade helped us find innovative ways to manage this shortage and make sure parents and caregivers got the medications they needed. We’ve already started making good use of the lessons from this shortage for the upcoming cold and flu season,” says Ms. Di Trapani. While Health Canada experts and health stakeholders do everything they can to help manage these shortages, they can’t do it alone. They need your assistance.

Heat waves mean high temperatures and humidity, and climate change can lead to longer and more intense heat events that can be dangerous for health, and even lead to death. Heat Alert and Response Systems, commonly known as HARS, are implemented by communities and help them prepare for and respond to extreme heat. They include community mobilization and engagement, an alert protocol, a communications plan, a community response plan, and an evaluation plan. “In short, HARS help communities and regions be ready for an extreme heat event and know what to do when they happen,” explains Rachel Siblock, a Policy Analyst in Health Canada’s Heat Division. The first step is for communities is to determine the threshold to activate their heat response plans and activities. This usually aligns with the heat alerts and warnings put out by Environment and Climate Change Canada. Communities then determine what activities within their plans are triggered. “A community’s HARS plans can include a range of activities to protect their citizens from extreme heat, such as handing out bottled water to residents, opening cooling centres, and having residents check-in on vulnerable people at home,” says Rachel. “Each community can decide what makes sense for them.” There are different ways various communities implement HARS. For example, cooling centres or splash pads are usually easier to access in urban centres. With older populations, posting physical materials like signs displaying ongoing heat warnings and posters with heat health information in common areas such as grocery stores or post offices is a better way to provide information, rather than social media posts. In rural areas, where the population may be more spread out, communities have focused on messages to ask people to check in on neighbours vulnerable to heat, actions that have been shown to be successful. Although most HARS are developed and coordinated at a local level, Health Canada provides guidance and information to help local and regional health authorities develop evidence-based extreme heat plans and interventions. Rachel and her colleagues at Health Canada also play a connecting role, linking municipal and health officials with questions to experts in other parts of Canada who might have answers. “Any heat response action that is implemented during a heat event has the potential to protect health, and increasing community leadership and support has been shown to work,” says Rachel. “When people understand how impactful heat can be, they are usually happy to be involved.” The team is currently working on a pilot project with BC’s Interior Health Authority, to collaborate and co-develop HARS with Indigenous communities in the region, in order to adapt activities and plans to be culturally appropriate and safe. Any communities who wish to develop their own HARS are welcome to contact the Heat Division, and join Health Canada’s Heat Community of Practice, a pan-Canadian network of people and organizations taking actions to protect Canadians from the health impacts of extreme heat.

As some vaccine preventable disease outbreaks - like measles, polio and diphtheria – have made headlines around the world in recent months, people may wonder why these outbreaks are occurring and if they are at risk. To understand the current situation, it is important to understand how vaccination works as a public health preventive measure. Today, I invite you to join me on a journey to learn more about vaccines and why they matter. I am extremely thankful for Canada’s long history of strong vaccination programs and their impact on improving health and will share a few examples with you. Vaccines – what have we achieved with them? Vaccines have greatly contributed to saving lives and improving the health of people in Canada and around the globe by limiting or stopping the ongoing circulation of some serious infectious diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccination prevents from 3.5 to 5 million deaths a year from diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, and measles, and early studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccines have also prevented millions of deaths worldwide. Thanks to vaccines, smallpox has been completely eradicated (meaning it no longer circulates and we don’t need to vaccinate against it anymore), and many other diseases have seen a significant reduction in their rates. Because vaccines help prevent and protect against certain diseases, vaccination for individuals of all ages is considered to be one of the best investments we can make to improve population health and reduce health care costs. Vaccines – how do they work? Vaccines work with the body’s natural defenses (the immune system) to make us less susceptible to infections and less likely to develop serious illness. Vaccines also decrease the chances of spreading infection from one person to another. Vaccination works by exposing our bodies to key parts of bacteria or viruses, called antigens, in a safe way so our immune system can develop an immune response against them. Later, if we are exposed to that same bacterium or virus, our immune system will be able to recognize the antigen and respond more quickly to help prevent us from getting the disease or from getting seriously ill if we do get the disease. Some vaccines can help to create community immunity (also known as herd immunity). This means that the greater the number of people who have been vaccinated against a disease, the less chance there is of the disease spreading in a community. This helps protect people who are at higher risk of developing severe complications from vaccine preventable diseases, including people who can’t be vaccinated or for whom a particular vaccine may not work as well, such as people who are immunocompromised. Let’s take a closer look at some of our available vaccines and the important impact they have had in Canada. In addition to those listed below, there are vaccines that can prevent against a number of other illnesses, such as certain types of pneumonia, meningitis, chickenpox, shingles, and hepatitis B, among others. There are also vaccines against specific respiratory viruses (such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2) and for travellers, depending on the country they are travelling to. Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine Measles can be a serious infection that can result in pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, leading to permanent brain damage and even death. It is also one of the most contagious diseases. Even a single case can spread quickly among people who are not vaccinated or previously infected. In a group of 100 people who have never had a measles infection, 95 of them need to be vaccinated to prevent measles from spreading. This is why population-level measles vaccination coverage has to remain high to prevent outbreaks. Luckily, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine protects against three contagious viruses: measles, mumps, and rubella. In Canada, cases of measles, mumps, and rubella have decreased by 98% or more as a direct result of the introduction of those vaccines in the 1960s and their inclusion within routine vaccination programs.

Keeping Canadians safe from botulism Have you ever heard of botulism? While this foodborne illness may be less well known than others, it can have serious consequences. Fortunately, botulism is very rare in Canada thanks to safe food practices and the work of devoted Health Canada scientists. Botulism is caused by eating food and drinks contaminated with botulinum toxin, a potent toxin produced by bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. Symptoms typically include blurred and double vision, drooping eyelids, and difficulty swallowing and speaking. Paralysis may descend to the muscles that help us breathe, requiring the use of mechanical ventilation. In some instances, it can take months or years to recover. Tragically, approximately one in ten people with botulism die of the disease. Health Canada Research Scientist, Dr. John Austin, and lab technicians, Dr. Richard Harris and Ryan Boone, analyse botulism samples and conduct research on the disease and the bacterium that causes it to find ways to better protect us from it. Let’s take a closer look to see how their work helps keep Canadians safe. Identifying the dangerous toxin There are various types of botulism, but the main ones are foodborne botulism and infant botulism. Foodborne botulism may occur in environments that have no oxygen, such as canned foods. This type of botulism can also be found in other foods such as garlic stored in oil, carrot juice, salted fish and traditionally prepared seal, whale and walrus meat. Infant botulism happens when the C. botulinum bacteria (sometimes found in honey) grow inside a baby’s body and produce toxins. Because infants don’t yet have enough good bacteria in their body, C. botulinum bacteria are able to grow and produce botulinum toxin. Working with the medical community “Botulinum toxin is the most potent toxin known. The oral lethal dose for a person is estimated to be approximately 70 millionths of a gram or 0.00007 g, which is an extremely small amount,” explains Dr. Austin. Because botulism is so dangerous, early intervention is key. As such, doctors prescribe antitoxins to patients they suspect may have botulism. They then send clinical samples to the Botulism Reference Service—run by Dr. Austin and his technicians—who determine if it’s actually botulism. “Thanfully, most samples don’t test positive for botulism. But this is still helpful information for doctors, who can rule out botulism as the cause of illness, and in turn, improve their patient’s care. When it is a case of botulism, we work with provinces and local health units to determine the source of botulism so the food product can be recalled and prevent further cases.” Helping food manufacturers and Indigenous communities improve their food safety practices In addition to helping the medical and public health communities, Dr. Austin and his colleagues work hard to make our food safer. “We’re always looking for ways to make food safer, so that botulism is even rarer. That’s why we continue to study new methods to eliminate the bacteria and its spores,” explains Dr. Austin. One of these new methods is UV light used to pasteurize or kill C. botulinum in foods. If this new method is found to be both safe and effective, it could soon be used by manufacturers for commercial foods. Certain traditional Indigenous foods, such as seal, are known to be sources of botulism. Recognizing this problem, Dr. Austin and his team worked with Dr. Daniel Leclair, then researcher at the Nunavik Research Centre, to find out why and to identify some mitigation strategies. While botulism is a serious and concerning food safety issue, we are lucky to have people like Dr. Richard Harris, Ryan Boone, and Dr. Austin helping to keep us safe from it.

Al Ramsay: Supporting the financial emancipation of Black and Afro-descendant communities  AUG. 1, 2023 VICE PRESIDENT AND HEAD, 2SLGBTQ+ & BLACK CUSTOMER SEGMENTS TD BANK GROUP On March 24, 1853, less than two decades removed from when the Slavery Abolition Act came into effect, a newspaper called The Provincial Freeman printed its first copy in Canada. Front and center on this anti-slavery newspaper was a motto that would define the ambitions and hope that Mary Ann Shadd, the first Black woman in North America to publish and edit a newspaper, had for formerly enslaved people of African descent. The Provincial Freeman's motto was "self-reliance is the true road to independence." After hundreds of years of the horrors that slavery had inflicted on millions of people, those words proclaimed that the fight was not yet won – and that emancipation was the beginning, not the end, of the long road to justice, equity, and economic freedom for Black and Afro-descendent people in this country. What communities have experienced since abolition show that emancipation was not the end of anti-Black sentiment, but rather an evolution of it. According to the CBC, a now void land title clause in Vancouver was used as far back as 1928 to prevent the sale or rent of land to people African descent. In 1946, Viola Desmond, an African Nova Scotian businesswoman, was famously arrested for sitting in a "whites-only" section of a New Glasgow, Nova Scotia movie theatre. And it was only in 1965 that the last segregated school in Ontario closed down (it took almost 20 years for the last one in Canada to shutter its doors in Lincolnville, Nova Scotia in 1983). The intergenerational trauma felt in Black and Afro-descendant communities remains ever present, and they continue to face systemic anti-Black racism no matter where they seem to look in our society, which extends to the financial services sector. For true emancipation to happen, we need to look at how our society really works – and doesn't – for equity-deserving communities. We need to work with these communities to determine where the gaps in support are, and to come up with solutions that will make a positive impact. In this instance, nothing less than financial emancipation of Black and Afro-descendant communities will make a long-lasting difference, and that includes supporting their economic empowerment by tackling the systemic barriers that they have and continue to face within our financial system. However, we know that change has never come fast enough for those who need it most. Throughout history though, what we've seen time and time again is that in the face of injustice, a future, one where everyone can be their true authentic self no matter who they are, is possible if people remain united in their collective action to make a difference. The truth is, change can only be made a reality through intentional engagement, hard work, and a commitment from members of our society to be better, active allies. Though, over the years, signs of this have sometimes felt hard to see. George Floyd, and action to combat anti-Black racism and its impact We all remember where we were when we saw the footage of George Floyd's murder. The impact his tragic death has had on the discourse around anti-Black racism is something that will be discussed for generations to come, but the message we heard loud and clear from Black and Afro-descendant communities was a resounding one: change can't wait. And according to a 2021 study conducted in Canada by Abacus Data, that sentiment applies to all areas of our society, including banking. Change can't wait when 76% of Black entrepreneurs surveyed in the Abacus study said their race makes it harder to succeed as an entrepreneur. It can't wait when respondents in that same study said access to capital was their greatest barrier as an entrepreneur. Change can't wait when only 19% of respondents said that they trust banks to do what is right for them and their community.

The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and saving for home ownership AUG. 16, 2023 For many Canadians, buying a home will likely be the most expensive purchase they ever make. Depending on the price of the home you're hoping to buy, you could be looking at a down payment of 5%, 10% or even 20% or more. But wait. Don't forget to factor in other costs, including land transfer taxes, lawyer fees, home insurance, an inspection and more. Depending on where you live, and the type of property you're eyeing, those costs can add up quickly. While following a budget can be a helpful place to start your savings journey, it's equally important to think about how you're saving, especially if you're aiming to eventually purchase a home. If you're thinking about buying a home, you may want to start by asking yourself if you are making the most of the registered accounts available to you. There are a number of registered savings plans available to Canadians, but two common accounts are: the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). And new for 2023, the First Home Savings Account (FHSA). Generally, these registered savings plans let your money grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and within these plans you may have the ability to hold investments such as guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and Mutual Funds. Customers are now able to open an FHSA at TD. In preparation, we wanted to help you get a better understanding of how the FHSA works, and how it could help you save for your first home. An FHSA combines some of the features of an RRSP and a TFSA. Like an RRSP, contributions are generally tax-deductible. Similar to TFSA withdrawals, when a qualifying withdrawal is made from an FHSA to purchase a qualifying home, the amount withdrawn, including any income or gain, is not taxable. But before we get too far into the details of the FHSA, here's a quick refresher on TFSAs and RRSPs. Remind me, what is a TFSA? TFSAs allow you to grow your money tax-free within the account on qualified investments, meaning you aren't taxed on interest earned, dividends or capital gains (subject to restrictions, please visit TD.com to learn more) provided you don't exceed your annual contribution limit. Also, you can make a qualifying withdrawal of your funds at any time, tax-free. Generally, within most TFSAs, you can save or invest your money (think: GICs, Mutual Funds, and cash). TFSAs that are opened with TD Direct Investing can also include stocks and bonds (to learn more, please visit TD Direct Investing). The Government of Canada sets the annual maximum limits for TFSA contributions yearly. For 2023, the maximum contribution limit is $6,500. The current lifetime contribution limit adds up to $88,000, provided you meet certain criteria. To learn more about TFSAs and contribution limits, please view this TD Stories article. Wait, what’s the difference between a TFSA and an RRSP? An RRSP is designed primarily to help you save money for retirement. Eligible RRSP contributions are tax-deductible, meaning that the amount of money you contribute in one year is generally deductible on your tax return for that year, potentially reducing the total amount of taxes you pay that year. When you contribute money to an RRSP, your funds are also "tax-advantaged," meaning you will not be taxed on the money you put into an RRSP until you withdraw it. Any eligible investment income earned on investments held within the RRSP grow tax-deferred, as long as the money remains within the RRSP, until it's withdrawn. While an RRSP is primarily designed to help Canadians save for retirement, the funds can be accessed earlier in some situations, such as through the Home Buyers' Plan. Under the Home Buyers' Plan, you can withdraw up to $35,000 from your RRSP to put towards the purchase or building of a qualifying home for yourself or a related person with a disability, tax-free[1].

Many Canadians who live with roommates or extended family would find it financially difficult to live on their own MAY 4, 2023 Having the money talk can be a tricky conversation, whether you're chatting with family, friends or a romantic partner. It becomes especially difficult in uncertain economic times when your loved ones might feel a little extra squeeze on their finances. Maru Public Opinion conducted a survey for TD and polled 1,540 randomly selected Canadian between December 2022 and 2023 on this topic. The "Beyond Banking" survey revealed that while 82% of respondents said they are still able to comfortably pay their bills and meet their financial obligations, 75% stated that the "rising cost of living" has negatively impacted their ability to save and/or invest as much money as they would like to, with 59% of respondents reporting that finding extra money to save or invest is a challenge for them. Living together: Sharing the cost of housing Given that housing is one of the largest single recurring expenses for Canadians, As the cost of living rises, some Canadians are also opting to live together, according to Natasha Struminikovski, Associate Vice President, Homeowners Journey, TD Bank According to the survey, roughly 23% of Canadians live with a roommate or family member other than their spouse/partner or child. Among these respondents, 79% agreed they would find it "very difficult" or "somewhat difficult" to be able to live on their own. For those living with a roommate or family member, 40% of Canadian respondents cited "convenience" as their reason, and more than half (56%) said it was about saving money. "A significant number of Canadians who were surveyed are choosing to share their living space in order to reduce their rental expenses," says Struminikovski. "This tells us that many are making the conscious decision to prioritize saving and investing more towards their future, which can be a sound financial decision." Living with a Partner: When would you first talk about money? Of course, one of the advantages to approaching your housing situation as one half of a couple is that you often have two incomes to work with when making financial decisions. For many couples, the first step to achieving financial intimacy is disclosing things like income, credit scores, debt, spending habits and attitudes toward money. The question is, at what point in the relationship do you want to bring up finances? According to the "Beyond Banking" survey, the majority of respondents who live with a roommate or family member (other than a spouse/partner or child) had pretty clear expectations about when they think they would first talk about money if they were to ever move in with a partner or spouse: 77% said they would have the money talk before moving in together, while only 5% said they would wait until after they moved in together. But for those surveyed who already lived with their spouse or partner, it worked out a little differently: 54% said they first talked about money before moving in together, while 21% first talked about it afterwards. For a small number of those surveyed, the answer about when to talk about money was never – 4% said they haven't ever had a real talk about money with their partner or spouse. Bank accounts: Yours, mine, or ours? When you're in a relationship for the long term, the question of how to organize and manage everyday finances with a partner or spouse is a big one. Do you want to keep separate bank accounts, have both separate and joint accounts, or share everything in one joint account? According to the survey, 48% of respondents currently living with a roommate or family member(s) other than a spouse/partner said they expect they would have some joint accounts as well as their own accounts. Forty-one per cent said they would continue to have their own accounts only. Only 11% said they would merge their finances into exclusively joint accounts. Total household income also appears to be a factor in whether respondents kept their personal finances separate. Households making less than $50,000 are more likely to keep their finances separate (42%) than those making $50,000-$95,000 (25%) or more than $100,000 (31%).

Three ways SMBs could benefit from artificial intelligence tools now JUL. 4, 2023 It wasn't that long ago that artificial intelligence was seen as a luxury reserved for large corporations; a promising technology that was just out of reach for small and medium sized businesses (SMBs). Those days, however, are gone. Today, there are a number of inexpensive, and sometimes free, tools available to small business owners. From chatbots to software that manages your cashflow or protects online stores from hackers, AI can make a difference for business owners looking to automate customer service, streamline operations and enhance customer experience to drive growth. Jeff Chan, Senior Manager of Enterprise Innovation at TD, leads a team that explores the possible role emerging tech (like generative AI) can play in meeting future customer needs. Generative AI – a subfield of artificial intelligence that powers the OpenAI chatbot, ChatGPT – describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations and videos. Chan said that for many small business owners, the benefits of AI are already available and will continue to improve over time. "Degrees of automation and automated decision making are already being used by small businesses today to help them manage inventory, follow up with clients and do things like improve their research and development practices," he said. "Thanks to the explosive growth of generative AI, I believe that how we currently operate, think and analyze data will change in ways we thought were still years off." Of course, Chan is quick to point out that Generative AI is in its early stages and there are risks associated with the use of the emerging technology of which small business owners need to be aware. Small business owners must assess these risks, as well as the terms governing the use of third-party AI systems, in association with their own use cases, before implementing any new AI system, including Generative AI. Here are three areas where small business owners may benefit from integrating AI into their businesses, provided the risks are understood: Delivering human-like customer service at scale Chan said that tools like automated responses have established themselves as staples of the customer service experience. One such common technology, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), allows telephone users to interact with a computer-operated telephone system through the use of voice or a telephone keypad. The purpose of automation is to free up time by prioritizing, managing, responding to and resolving customer inquiries to help improve the customer experience. Today's chatbots are limited in what they can resolve. According to Chan, this is because it's extremely difficult to train those chatbots to understand human, or natural, language. But chatbots powered by generative AI, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, are able to understand conversational language. "Having that ability could unlock new opportunities to help resolve customer service issues in a more human-like way and not through pressing buttons," Chan said. "The more likely it can be resolved by an artificial intelligence, the more time you give human service team to focus on complex issues that would benefit from more human involvement." As AI continues to improve, interactions by customers with anything digital will begin to sound and feel more and more human-like, which is the goal when you're looking to create a more personalized experience, Chan said. New insights and customer experiences from existing data Because AI can rapidly process massive amounts of information, it has the ability to comb through an organization's data to identify patterns and make connections that might otherwise go unnoticed. Chan said that many small business owners may not realize that they're already using AI to optimize their businesses. "AI-driven solutions are no longer reserved for companies with deep pockets," he said. "Now, there are very cost-effective solutions that can give small businesses the power to do more with their data than ever before. Next generation AI should be affordable, giving entrepreneurs more ways to find those nuggets of insight that could help them uncover net-new revenue opportunities." At the same time, small business owners looking to ensure highly-personalized experiences for their customers can use AI to help improve their messaging based on their customers' preferences and behaviours.

How do mortgage rates influence housing prices? Plus 3 more questions for TD Economics 5 MINUTE READ • JUN. 19, 2023 Canada's housing market is once again a seller's market; at least, that's how TD Economist Rishi Sondhi would characterize the Canadian housing market right now. Sondhi said the proof is in the TD Economics data research: in April, existing home sales increased to their highest level since June of last year. Prices crept up in April, rising 6% month-over-month, while the supply of homes for sale hasn't kept pace with demand, with the number of new listings remaining low. That means competition for available homes for sale is up, prices are up, and the number of houses on the market remains well below historical norms. Combined, those factors add up to a market that favours sellers over buyers, Sondhi said. "One would perhaps expect more of an increase in listings given that demand and prices are coming back so forcefully, but that's not what we're seeing right now," says Sondhi. To help understand the factors contributing to this current seller's market, TD Stories went down the real estate rabbit hole with Sondhi, where he answered some of the most pressing housing-related questions, including: What could be contributing to the low supply of homes for sale in the Canadian housing market? First of all, notes Sondhi, there are some factors keeping homeowners from being forced to sell their homes, known as forced selling. These factors include a strong job market and the ability for some Canadians to lengthen their mortgage amortization in a high interest rate environment. Some individuals with variable rate mortgages who have seen their interest rates rise, for instance, might be able to extend the length of their mortgage so that they can continue to afford their regular payments. Sondhi said investors with rental properties are also holding onto their properties and opting not to sell, as the rental market remains strong. At the same time, construction timelines are increasing for all types of units, so it's taking longer for new homes to hit the market, which is further slowing the availability of homes for sale. Sondhi says there may also be a short-term psychological factor affecting supply as some homeowners keep their eyes on the market before deciding whether or not to sell. This could include prospective sellers who are hoping the market heats up before putting their houses up for sale. "The market has been correcting for a long period of time," Sondhi says. "Some potential sellers might need more time to see whether the market is rebounding before listing their homes. Sellers might also have seen what houses were selling for last year and might be waiting to see if house prices return to those levels before listing their homes.” Another factor that could potentially be straining supply is that move-up buying has been hindered by a tough affordability backdrop. For example, those who want to move into bigger (and more expensive) homes may be waiting until it's more affordable to do so. This could mean that these would-be movers are staying in their homes longer. The Bank of Canada interest rate has been rising. We're curious: how do mortgage rates influence housing prices? Mortgage rates and housing prices are typically inversely related. Often, when mortgage rates increase, housing prices decrease. However, Sondhi explains, it’s important to remember mortgage rates aren't the only factor that can impact housing prices. Others include the state of the job market, population growth and the housing supply. In the first quarter of 2022, mortgage rates and housing prices rose simultaneously. "If you think back to the beginning of the pandemic, there was the whole 'race for space' phenomenon," says Sondhi, explaining the trend that occurred when urban dwellers in many Canadian cities started searching for detached, single-family homes during the pandemic. This trend peaked early in 2022. As an emergency measure, the Bank of Canada slashed interest rates, which caused mortgage rates to dip in 2020 and 2021 as a result. The federal government also implemented temporary measures to help Canadians financially stay afloat. Coupled with strong demand, these factors pushed housing prices up.

Asian Heritage Month: How one TD colleague honours her family's story by paying it forward MAY 1, 2023 TD is proud to support and celebrate Pan-Asian colleagues and customers across Canada. This Asian Heritage Month, we're sharing stories from TD colleagues like Sona Mehta, the Senior Vice President of Canadian Personal Banking. Read on to learn about her family's history and how she found a sense of community and belonging in Canada. Sona Mehta's parents immigrated to Canada from their home country of India in the late 1970s to start a new life. Sona's father came first, to look for a job and a place to live. Hope and struggle went hand in hand, in what may be a familiar experience for many immigrants. An engineer, Sona's father struggled initially to find work in his field because prospective employers sought Canadian education and work experience. "So, instead of listing his engineering degree and experience on his resume, he put down that he had a Grade 10 education, so that he would be considered for factory jobs, instead of being viewed as overqualified," Sona said. Soon after her father found a job and an apartment to live in, Sona – who was then just two years old – and her mother made their way over to Canada. "My mother had never been on a plane, and now she was getting on a plane going to a foreign country with a toddler in tow and leaving all of our extended family and life behind," Sona said. "I can barely imagine what that was like…but they were driven by the hope of a better life in Canada." While her mother had a master's degree in Psychology, she too initially worked in a factory, sewing, to help make ends meet after arriving in Canada. As the years went by, Sona's father landed an engineering job, and the family was able to buy their first home. Sona never forgot what her parents went through to establish the family in Canada, an experience that has followed her through her entire career. Today, Sona is Senior Vice President of Canadian Personal Banking at TD, where she draws on her life experience to help make banking products and services better for TD customers – including those new to the country. "There's this common value set here at TD," Sona said. "The Bank deeply cares about diversity and inclusivity. The Bank's culture is what brought me here, and it's what has kept me here." Sona continues to contribute to the TD culture of diversity and inclusion through the Bank's Pan-Asian Employee Resource Group (ERG) – ERGs are colleague-led groups usually organized around a shared identity or affinity – which is one of many throughout the organization. Questions about belonging Growing up in Brantford, Sona had what she describes as a wonderful, secure childhood. She had a great childhood friend who lived next door, and they would play outside from dawn to dusk. While she didn't grow up with material luxuries, she had things even more special – like the bean bag stuffies and handmade dresses her mother made for her. She felt lucky. But at the same time, each day she went to school, she felt something was missing. “I didn’t belong,” Sona said. “At the time, I wasn't sure why – was it because I was shy or was it because I was only one of two South Asians at my school? All I knew was that I didn't fit in. In hindsight, what I've learned is regardless of what's keeping you from feeling included -- you almost can't correct for not belonging until you truly belong." "Nothing replaces feeling included. I think that's been one of my life's lessons."

New Ways to Create With Music and Collaborate With Friends on Instagram August 11, 2023 Today, we’re excited to introduce new, fun ways to share with friends and interact with creators through music, photos and reels on Instagram. Soundtrack to Your Photo Carousels Whether you’re sharing a collection of summer memories with friends or moments from your camera roll, you can now add music to your photo carousels. Building off our launch of music for feed photos, anyone can add a song to capture the mood and bring their carousel to life. Invite Your Friends to Collab on a Post or Reel We’re opening up more possibilities with Collabs: now, you can invite up to three friends to co-author a feed post, carousel or reel. Once they accept, the content will reach each collaborator’s audience and appear on each account’s profile grid. Have a private account? No problem — both private and public accounts can be added as collaborators on a post or reel. If your account is private, you can start your own post or reel and invite a collaborator as long as they follow you back. Join In With Your Favorite Creators and Artists on Reels With the Add Yours sticker, a creator or artist can invite their followers to join in on a fun prompt or challenge they create on Reels, and then hand-pick their favorite submissions to celebrate their fans’ creativity. Anyone can create a reel to put their own spin on an Add Yours prompt for a chance to get recognized by its creator. You’ll get notified if a creator chooses your reel as one of their favorites, and others on Instagram can watch your submission when tapping on the Add Yours sticker if your account is public. More Music on Instagram Coming Your Way Music is a key part of how people express their creativity and interests on Instagram. We’re excited to bring our music library to more countries over the coming weeks. We’re also partnering with Spotify in Mexico and Brazil to feature 50 of the most popular songs from Instagram Reels with a new Reels Music Chart on Spotify. We’re always working on ways to improve your Instagram experience. We’ll continue to build features that make it easier and more fun to create and share on Instagram.

Introducing AudioCraft: A Generative AI Tool For Audio and Music August 2, 2023 Imagine a professional musician being able to explore new compositions without having to play a single note on an instrument. Or a small business owner adding a soundtrack to their latest video ad on Instagram with ease. That’s the promise of AudioCraft — our latest AI tool that generates high-quality, realistic audio and music from text. AudioCraft consists of three models: MusicGen, AudioGen and EnCodec. MusicGen, which was trained with Meta-owned and specifically licensed music, generates music from text prompts, while AudioGen, which was trained on public sound effects, generates audio from text prompts. Today, we’re excited to release an improved version of our EnCodec decoder, which allows higher quality music generation with fewer artifacts. We’re also releasing our pre-trained AudioGen models, which let you generate environmental sounds and sound effects like a dog barking, cars honking, or footsteps on a wooden floor. And lastly, we’re sharing all of the AudioCraft model weights and code. We’re open-sourcing these models, giving researchers and practitioners access so they can train their own models with their own datasets for the first time, and help advance the field of AI-generated audio and music. While we’ve seen a lot of excitement around generative AI for images, video, and text, audio has seemed to lag a bit behind. There’s some work out there, but it’s highly complicated and not very open, so people aren’t able to readily play with it. Generating high-fidelity audio of any kind requires modeling complex signals and patterns at varying scales. Music is arguably the most challenging type of audio to generate as it’s composed of local and long-range patterns, from a suite of notes to a global musical structure with multiple instruments. The AudioCraft family of models are capable of producing high-quality audio with long-term consistency, and they’re easy to use. With AudioCraft, we simplify the overall design of generative models for audio compared to prior work in the field — giving people the full recipe to play with the existing models that Meta has been developing over the past several years while also empowering them to push the limits and develop their own models. AudioCraft works for music, sound, compression, and generation — all in the same place. Because it’s easy to build on and reuse, people who want to build better sound generators, compression algorithms, or music generators can do it all in the same code base and build on top of what others have done. Having a solid open source foundation will foster innovation and complement the way we produce and listen to audio and music in the future. With even more controls, we think MusicGen can turn into a new type of instrument — just like synthesizers when they first appeared. We see the AudioCraft family of models as tools for musicians and sound designers to provide inspiration, help people quickly brainstorm and iterate on their compositions in new ways. We can’t wait to see what people create with Audiocraft.

In the coming weeks, we’ll also roll out new metrics on Professional Dashboard that will show creators how their accounts are performing at a more granular level, including levels of interaction and consumption by format, as well as by followers and non-followers across all of their content. In addition to net followers, creators will also see how many followers they gained and lost in a specific time frame. More Ways To Earn Money on Facebook We’re testing the ability to cross-post Instagram branded content reels and stories to Facebook, increasing campaign reach and impact. On Facebook, we’ve reduced partnership ads eligibility requirements, so that creators using Pages can give their brand partners permission to run ads from their Facebook Page. We’re also continuing to invite more creators to our Performance bonus program that rewards creators for garnering strong engagement with their content on Facebook. And we’re introducing extra bonuses so creators can earn more.

How AI Influences What You See on Facebook and Instagram June 29, 2023 Billions of people use Facebook and Instagram every day to share the ups and downs of life, to connect with people who share their interests, and to discover content they enjoy. To make everyone’s experience on our apps unique and personalized to them, we use AI systems to decide what content appears, informed by the choices they make. I wrote previously about the relationship between you and the algorithms Meta uses to shape what you see on Facebook and Instagram, and to challenge the myth that algorithms leave people powerless over the content they see. In that piece, I wrote that we needed to be more frank about how this relationship works and to give you more control over what you see. Today, we’re building on that commitment by being more transparent around several of the AI systems that incorporate your feedback to rank content across Facebook and Instagram. These systems make it more likely that the posts you see are relevant and interesting to you. We’re also making it clearer how you can better control what you see on our apps, as well as testing new controls and making others more accessible. And we’re giving more detailed information for experts so they can better understand and analyze our systems. This is part of a wider ethos of openness, transparency and accountability. With rapid advances taking place with powerful technologies like generative AI, it’s understandable that people are both excited by the possibilities and concerned about the risks. We believe that the best way to respond to those concerns is with openness. Generally speaking, we believe that as these technologies are developed, companies should be more open about how their systems work and collaborate openly across industry, government and civil society to help ensure they are developed responsibly. That starts with giving you more insight into, and control over, the content you see. How AI Predictions Influence Recommendations Our AI systems predict how valuable a piece of content might be to you, so we can show it to you sooner. For example, sharing a post is often an indicator that you found that post to be interesting, so predicting that you will share a post is one factor our systems take into account. As you might imagine, no single prediction is a perfect gauge of whether a post is valuable to you. So we use a wide variety of predictions in combination to get as close as possible to the right content, including some based on behavior and some based on user feedback received through surveys. We want to be more open about how this works. A model of transparency Meta has been developing and advocating for some time is the publication of system cards, which give people insight into how our systems work in a way that is accessible for those who don’t have deep technical knowledge. Today, we are releasing 22 system cards for Facebook and Instagram. They give information about how our AI systems rank content, some of the predictions each system makes to determine what content might be most relevant to you, as well as the controls you can use to help customize your experience. They cover Feed, Stories, Reels and other surfaces where people go to find content from the accounts or people they follow. The system cards also cover AI systems that recommend “unconnected” content from people, groups, or accounts they don’t follow. You can find a more detailed explanation of the AI behind content recommendations here. To give a further level of detail beyond what’s published in the system cards, we’re sharing the types of inputs – known as signals – as well as the predictive models these signals inform that help determine what content you will find most relevant from your network on Facebook. The categories of signals we’re releasing represent the vast majority of signals currently used in Facebook Feed ranking for this content. You can find these signals and predictions in the Transparency Center, along with how frequently they tend to be used in the overall ranking process.

Meta’s Q1 2023 Security Reports: Protecting People and Businesses May 3, 2023 We know that safety and security are top of mind for people using our apps, including businesses and advertisers. Today, as part of our quarterly integrity reporting, we’re sharing updates on our work to combat a range of threats, including covert influence operations, cyber espionage and malware campaigns. In my first year as Meta’s chief information security officer, my focus has been bringing together teams working on integrity, security, support, and operations so that we can work together in the most effective way possible. Each of these efforts has been ongoing for many years, and a key focus for us has been sharing progress, bringing in outside experts and working with other companies to tackle industry-wide threats. It’s been more than 10 years since our bug bounty program began working with the security research community, 10 years since we first published transparency reports on government data requests, over five years since we started sharing takedowns of covert influence operations and five years since we published our first community standards enforcement report. We’ve learned a lot through this work, including the importance of sharing both qualitative and quantitative insights into our integrity work. And it’s been encouraging to see our peers join us in expanding their trust and safety reporting. We’re committed to continuing these efforts, and today’s updates are good examples of this work. Countering Malware Campaigns Across the Internet My teams track and take action against hundreds of threat actors around the world, including malware campaigns. Here are a few things that stood out from our latest malware work. First, our threat research has shown time and again that malware operators, just like spammers, are very attuned to what’s trendy at any given moment. They latch onto hot-button issues and popular topics to get people’s attention. The latest wave of malware campaigns have taken notice of generative AI technology that’s captured people’s imagination and excitement. Since March alone, our security analysts have found around 10 malware families posing as ChatGPT and similar tools to compromise accounts across the internet. For example, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-related tools. In fact, some of these malicious extensions did include working ChatGPT functionality alongside the malware. This was likely to avoid suspicion from the stores and from users. We’ve detected and blocked over 1,000 of these unique malicious URLs from being shared on our apps, and reported them to our industry peers at file-sharing services where malware was hosted so they, too, can take appropriate action. This is not unique to the generative AI space. As an industry, we’ve seen this across other topics popular in their time, such as crypto scams fueled by the interest in digital currency. The generative AI space is rapidly evolving and bad actors know it, so we should all be vigilant. Second, we’ve seen that our and industry’s efforts are forcing threat actors to rapidly evolve their tactics in attempts to evade detection and enable persistence. One way they do this is by spreading across as many platforms as they can to protect against enforcement by any one service. For example, we’ve seen malware families leveraging services like ours and LinkedIn, browsers like Chrome, Edge, Brave and Firefox, link shorteners, file-hosting services like Dropbox and Mega, and more. When they get caught, they mix in more services including smaller ones that help them disguise the ultimate destination of links. Another example is when some malware families masquerading as ChatGPT apps switched their lures to other popular themes like Google’s Bard or TikTok marketing support, in response to detection.

How Meta Is Advancing Democracy March 29, 2023 This week, the United States, Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea and Republic of Zambia will co-host the second Summit for Democracy, bringing together the public and private sector in support of a common set of goals to advance democracy. Today, we’re sharing our commitments to counter the misuse of technology, enable secure and private connections and respect human rights, among others, in line with the Summit’s call of the private sector: 1.	Countering the surveillance-for-hire threats together with industry peers: On Monday, as part of Tech Accord, Meta, alongside Microsoft, Cisco and Trend Micro, published a set of principles and industry best practices to help guide our collective response against malicious groups that indiscriminately target people around the world. Together, we shared specific industry principles for countering surveillance-for-hire groups, including through maintaining the integrity and security of our industry’s products and services, investing in cybersecurity awareness for our users and the public more broadly and jointly identifying further ways to actively counter the cyber mercenary market. These principles are based on our years of experience with countering these threats, and align with our own recent policy recommendations that we put forth to enable a broader whole-of-society response. 2.	Enabling secure, private connections: Internet disruptions threaten to deny peoples’ human rights and cut people off from receiving and sending vital news and information. We recently launched a feature that allows users to connect to WhatsApp by proxy when their internet connection is disrupted or blocked. We’ll also further integrate end-to-end encryption into our messaging services to protect the right to privacy, in line with our commitment to uphold the fundamental human rights of people, especially those historically marginalized. 3.	Countering government abuse of digital technology: We’ve made significant investments in countering the targeting of our systems by authoritarian governments who attempt to surveil regime critics, opposition figures, and human rights defenders. When we see this type of activity, we take action on their accounts, block their domain infrastructure from being shared on our services and, where feasible and as appropriate, notify people who we believe were targeted by these malicious operations. 4.	Respecting human rights and protecting human rights defenders: Since releasing our Corporate Human Rights Policy in March 2021, we have carried out various forms of human rights due diligence, including in product design and as a result of crisis and conflict, to help prevent or mitigate human rights risks to the extent possible. We will continue our commitment to protect human rights defenders and to ensure that, through product, policy, and operational interventions, we support their on-platform presence and ability to promote human rights. Underpinning these commitments is the imperative to “know and show” as set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which creates an expectation of transparency and accountability for our human rights responsibilities. We support the principles enshrined in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Copenhagen Pledge on Tech and Democracy, which seek to make digital technologies work for democracy and human rights. We also support and contribute to ongoing UN processes, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and other relevant multilateral and multi stakeholder fora, including the Internet Governance Forum and Freedom Online Coalition.

Update on Meta’s Year of Efficiency March 14, 2023 Mark Zuckerberg just shared the following with Meta employees: Meta is building the future of human connection, and today I want to share some updates on our Year of Efficiency that will help us do that. The goals of this work are: (1) to make us a better technology company and (2) to improve our financial performance in a difficult environment so we can execute our long term vision. Our efficiency work has several parallel workstreams to improve organizational efficiency, dramatically increase developer productivity and tooling, optimize distributed work, garbage collect unnecessary processes, and more. I’ve tried to be open about all the work that’s underway, and while I know many of you are energized by this, I also recognize that the idea of upcoming org changes creates uncertainty and stress. My hope is to make these org changes as soon as possible in the year so we can get past this period of uncertainty and focus on the critical work ahead. Here’s the timeline you should expect: over the next couple of months, org leaders will announce restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, canceling lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates. With less hiring, I’ve made the difficult decision to further reduce the size of our recruiting team. We will let recruiting team members know tomorrow whether they’re impacted. We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in late May. In a small number of cases, it may take through the end of the year to complete these changes. Our timelines for international teams will also look different, and local leaders will follow up with more details. Overall, we expect to reduce our team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven’t yet hired. This will be tough and there’s no way around that. It will mean saying goodbye to talented and passionate colleagues who have been part of our success. They’ve dedicated themselves to our mission and I’m personally grateful for all their efforts. We will support people in the same ways we have before and treat everyone with the gratitude they deserve. After restructuring, we plan to lift hiring and transfer freezes in each group. Other relevant efficiency timelines include targeting this summer to complete our analysis from our hybrid work year of learning so we can further refine our distributed work model. We also aim to have a steady stream of developer productivity enhancements and process improvements throughout the year. As I’ve talked about efficiency this year, I’ve said that part of our work will involve removing jobs — and that will be in service of both building a leaner, more technical company and improving our business performance to enable our long term vision. I understand that this update may still feel surprising, so I’d like to lay out some broader context on our vision, our culture, and our operating philosophy. Building a Better Technology Company Every day Meta builds new ways for people to feel closer. This is a fundamental human need that may be more important in today’s complex world than ever. One day we hope to enable every person to feel as strong a sense of connection as you feel when you’re physically with someone you love. We do leading work across a wide range of advanced technologies and then distill that into inspiring products that improve people’s lives. We do this with AI to help you creatively express yourself and discover new content, with the metaverse to deliver a realistic sense of presence, with new media formats to create richer experiences, with encryption to let you communicate privately in more and more ways, and with business tools to help reach customers, create opportunity and grow the economy. Simply put: if you want to invent the future or apply the best ideas to reach people at the greatest scale, then Meta is the best place to do that.

Embracing Change Through Inclusion: Meta’s 2022 Diversity Report July 19, 2022 By Maxine Williams, Chief Diversity Officer Since 2014, we’ve publically reported our diversity metrics and shared our plans to better support underrepresented people in our workforce and through our products. Today, we’re releasing our 2022 Annual Diversity Report and sharing highlights below. We’re also sharing how we’re putting diversity, equity and inclusion at the forefront of our work toward the metaverse by building products with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Read the full report. The Impact of Remote Work on Diversity We’ve shifted our approach to work, and now, working at Meta isn’t limited by geography — approximately 75% of teams at Meta are working across multiple locations. For the first time, we’re hiring individuals who are fully remote and working from locations where we don’t have offices, increasing the diversity of our candidate pool and workforce. Over the past year, we’ve seen that: •	US candidates who accepted remote job offers were substantially more likely to be Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, veterans and/or people with disabilities. •	Globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were more likely to be women. It’s not only about getting people in the door – it’s about making sure they can thrive at Meta, which is why we’re continuing to empower our employees with flexibility and benefits that match their evolving needs. Inclusive Innovation for the Metaverse We’re collaborating with diverse companies, developers, experts and policymakers to build the metaverse — the next generation of digital experiences — with diversity, equity and inclusion from the start. For example: •	We offer more than one quintillion different attribute combinations for Meta Avatars, from skin tones to facial shapes and assistive devices, like hearing aids, wheelchairs and more so that everyone can feel represented and included. •	We know VR devices can be cost-prohibitive for many, so we’re working on a web-based version of Horizon Worlds that will let more people get a glimpse of virtual reality from other devices, like smartphones. •	We’re investing $150 million through Meta Immersive Learning and working with partners to help diverse creators develop skills in AR, VR and immersive media. This is part of our greater effort to help creators with a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives make a living in the metaverse. Our Workforce and Leadership Diversity Continue to Grow In 2019 and 2020, we set ambitious five-year goals to increase representation in our workforce, and the latest numbers reflect meaningful progress. 1.	50-in-5 Update: In 2019, we committed to doubling the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US and the number of women in our global workforce by 2024. We met and exceeded that goal for each of those groups – two years ahead of schedule – and we are working to continue improving these gains. Since 2019: We have doubled the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US. We have also doubled the number of women in our global workforce. 2.	We also challenged ourselves to raise the number of underrepresented people to at least 50% of our global workforce. As of June 30, 2022: People with disabilities now represent 6.2% of our US workforce, up from 4.7% in 2021. Based on voluntary self-identification, veterans represent 2.3% of our US workforce and members of the LGBTQ+ community make up 10.0%. Underrepresented people make up 46.7% of our global workforce, up from 45.6% in 2021. 3.	30-in-5 Update: In 2020, we challenged ourselves to increase the number of US based leaders (Director-level employees and above) who are people of color by 30%. As of this year: Through promotions and hiring, we are on track to achieve (and in some cases exceed) our ambitious goal to increase the representation of all people of color in leadership positions in the US by 30% by 2025. As an example, so far we have increased Black employee leadership by 44.1% since 2020.

Celebrating Black History Month February 1, 2021 This Black History Month, Facebook is celebrating the Black community as people make their voices heard, raise awareness and inspire action across the Facebook app, Instagram and Messenger. We are also sharing an update on the commitments we made in June, including $200 million to support Black-owned businesses and organizations as part of a broader $1.1 billion investment in Black and diverse suppliers and communities in the US. Black history is not just a month. It is written every day. Black creators and community leaders are making their mark on the world and using our apps to share their stories — from pushing culture forward on Instagram to turning Facebook movements into lasting legacies. In turn, Facebook has been using its platforms to elevate Black voices and businesses. This month, in particular, we’re spotlighting content from the Black community and the diversity of experiences, interests and definitions of “Blackness.” We’re starting by launching “Written By,” a docuseries celebrating the powerful movements happening across our apps. Throughout the month, we’ll feature stories by award-winning director and cinematographer Bradford Young on our Facebook company page to promote conversations about how Black history continues to be written in real-time. We will also officially kick off We The Culture, a creative community fueled and curated by Black creators dedicated to championing Black culture. Started by a passionate team of Black employees at Facebook, We The Culture’s goal is to partner with Black creators to spark community and empower them to build compelling and successful networks across our apps. Over the years, we’ve invested $25 million in support of Black content partnerships, and we’ll continue to elevate Black public figures and creators in film, television, fitness, sports, broadcasting, publishing and music. Later this month, Facebook Watch is dropping a new original four-episode miniseries showcasing Black excellence in music. Each episode of “Forward: The Future of Black Music” will feature a music icon shining the light on a newcomer they believe to be the future. Influenced by the classic TV series “Iconoclasts,” viewers will be a fly-on-the-wall for a musical experience with a legend and their successor. The series will also be viewable on Messenger’s Watch Together. On the Facebook app, the Lift Black Voices hub will feature an expansive view of the Black diaspora — honoring and celebrating the past, present and future of Black communities. Content will be refreshed throughout the month and will include themes such as Black history throughout the diaspora, Black love and Black creatives and the new vanguard. Facebook app will also launch “Black Makes A Way” to spotlight the diversity within the Black experience. We’ve partnered with Theresa Tha Songbird to create a visual cypher of her poem “You So Black” and will showcase members of Facebook Groups who are lending their voice to further equity, inclusivity and excellence throughout the community. On Instagram, we’ll be celebrating Black innovation with #ShareBlackStories, a multi-channel, call-to-action designed to support and inspire our Black community in the US. We’re publishing new creative tools in the Instagram Camera and stories visible on @instagram, @creators, @design, @shop and @instagramforbusiness throughout February and hosting workshops and other virtual community-focused moments for Black creators. To encourage diversity on the Facebook Gaming platform, we have allocated $10 million over two years to fund the Black Gaming Creator Program, a path for Black gaming creators to apply for partnership status and exclusive benefits including mentorship and training on the platform. This month and beyond, we’re using our platforms to elevate Black businesses. Black-owned businesses have been facing enormous challenges during the pandemic. In June, Facebook committed an additional $200 million to Black-owned businesses, creators and nonprofits. Since then, we have awarded grants to over 10,000 Black-owned businesses in the US and launched additional resources and programming.

Our Commitment to Combating Climate Change November 1, 2021 Climate change is the greatest threat we all face — and the need to act grows more urgent every day. The science is clear and unambiguous. As world leaders, advocates, environmental groups and others meet in Glasgow this week at COP26, we want to see bold action agreed to, with the strongest possible commitments to achieve net zero targets that help limit warming to 1.5˚C. We are going to play our part too. As a global business that connects more than 3 billion people every month, we have an opportunity and a responsibility to make a real difference. That starts with getting our own house in order. Starting last year, we achieved net zero emissions for our global operations, and we’re supported by 100% renewable energy. To achieve this we’ve reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 94% since 2017. We invest enough in wind and solar energy to cover all our operations. And for the remaining emissions, we support projects that remove emissions from the atmosphere. We’ve also set ambitious goals for our suppliers to be net zero and for our operations to restore more water than we use by 2030. Since our first wind contract in 2013, we’ve contracted over seven gigawatts of new solar and wind energy, all in the same power grids where our data centers are located, which are some of the most efficient in the world. We are also implementing measures to reduce our business travel emissions, and joining the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance as a founding member to help accelerate the path to net zero air travel by driving investment in sustainable aviation fuel. But this is not enough. Social media companies have the power to connect people with each other to make a difference at scale, amplify marginalized voices and share powerful information. Every day we see people use our services to raise awareness, organize for action, and make their voices heard on a wide range of environmental issues. We want to play our part by helping people find accurate, science-led information while also tackling misinformation. Elevating Authoritative Climate Information Last year, we launched the Climate Science Center on Facebook to connect people with factual resources from the world’s leading climate organizations, like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, UN Environment Program and more than 200 others. They can also find steps they can take in their own lives to combat climate change. Today, we are starting to expand it to more than 100 countries. And we’re also adding a new section that shows countries’ greenhouse gas emissions as compared to their commitments and targets, so people can better understand where their country is today and what more needs to be done. Earlier this year, we started adding informational labels to some posts on climate change directing people to the Climate Science Center to find out more. We’re now expanding these labels on posts in more than a dozen countries, including for the first time in Belgium, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and Taiwan. Tackling Climate Misinformation We have a responsibility to tackle climate misinformation on our services, which is why we partner with more than 80 independent fact-checking organizations globally to review and rate content, including content about climate change. When they rate content as false, we reduce its distribution so fewer people see it and we show a warning label with more context. And we apply penalties to people who repeatedly share false information. Ahead of COP26, we’ve also activated a feature we use during critical public events to utilize keyword detection so related content is easier for fact-checkers to find — because speed is especially important during such events. This feature is available to fact-checkers for content in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, German, French and Dutch. Learn more about how we’re tackling climate change misinformation.

How Meta Is Preparing for Brazil’s 2022 Elections August 12, 2022 Update on August 16, 2022 at 10:30AM PT: As part of our work to protect the 2022 election in Brazil, we will prohibit ads calling into question the legitimacy of the upcoming election. Originally published on August 12, 2022 at 6:00AM PT: Today, we want to share our work to protect the integrity of presidential elections taking place in Brazil in October 2022. In recent years, we’ve increased our efforts to combat misinformation by investing in teams, technology and partnerships to ensure the safety of people using Meta’s platforms. Since 2016, we’ve quadrupled our security and integrity workforce to more than 40,000 people globally. Last year alone, we invested nearly $5 billion in both areas. We know that local knowledge is essential for this work to be effective, so we also have a large team of specialists based in Brazil who have a deep understanding of the situation. These efforts are intensified as the election approaches, and our work to protect the integrity of our platforms will continue after the vote. Preventing and Stopping Election Interference Removing content that violates our policies on voter suppression, such as posts that discourage people from voting, is among our many responses to potential interference in the electoral process. We take many actions to prevent hate speech or the incitement of violence on our platforms. Currently, 99.7% of the fake accounts we remove from Facebook are deleted by artificial intelligence, before they are reported by users. We also investigate and disrupt networks that use fake accounts in a coordinated way to influence public debate. Closer to October, we will activate an Elections Operations Center focused on Brazil, an initiative we’ve implemented since 2018, to bring together experts from across the company – including intelligence, data science, engineering, research, operations, public policy and legal teams. They work together to identify potential threats on our platforms in real time, accelerating our response time. Collaborating With Authorities In partnership with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE), in December 2021 we started adding a label to posts about political elections on Facebook and Instagram, directing people to reliable information on the Electoral Justice website. In the first two months after its launch, the label led to a 10-fold increase in visits to the Electoral Justice portal. Between the end of April and the beginning of May, we posted reminders on Facebook for users to request or update their voter cards. The content was seen by the majority of adults using Facebook in Brazil and more than three  million people clicked to see more information. Closer to the upcoming election, we will again display reminders on Facebook and Instagram about voting day to raise awareness among voters and reduce abstention rates. For the first time, the TSE will be able to report content directly on Facebook and Instagram that may violate our policies. We will analyze the reports once they are received. WhatsApp launched an extrajudicial channel of communication in the 2020 municipal election to receive complaints from the TSE. The focus is on quick response to potential cases of bulk messaging, which is forbidden by local electoral law and by the app’s terms of service. We also developed a virtual assistant on WhatsApp with the TSE, as we did during Brazil’s 2020 municipal election. The chatbot is accessible through the number +55 61 9637-1078. It allows voters to interact directly with the electoral authority and receive relevant information about the vote. Meta has hosted training sessions for electoral officials all over Brazil to explain our actions to curb misinformation, share details on how Facebook and Instagram work, and detail our content rules, which we call our Community Standards and Community Guidelines. We also offer workshops to candidates and their campaign teams. The partnership with the TSE also includes booklets with information for the electoral community and a guide to combating online violence against women in politics, also supported by the Women’s Democracy Network (WDN) – Brazil Chapter.

An Independent Assessment of Meta’s Human Rights Impact in the Philippines December 2, 2021 Our technologies offer a critically important space for people to exercise their human rights, where they can express themselves, shine a light on important issues and hold those in power to account. And, we know that people can misuse technology to heighten existing social tensions and suppress people’s fundamental rights. In line with our Corporate Human Rights Policy, we conduct human rights impact assessments to better understand the role our technologies play in society, including how to help prevent and mitigate related risks. Today, we’re publishing the findings of the independent human rights impact assessment we commissioned in the Philippines, along with details on how we’ve responded to the recommendations in the assessment. We recognize that complex challenges outlined in the report may continue to evolve, and so will our approach and strategies to build systems that help promote human rights. The assessment found that Meta technologies, in addition to being widely used in the Philippines, do play an important and positive role in providing access to economic opportunities, giving voice to people and being essential tools for monitoring and defending human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also highlights salient human rights risks in the Philippines, including concerns about the misuse of our technologies for misinformation and disinformation, online harassment and incitement of violence. We’ve taken concrete steps to mitigate these risks and others identified in the report, and we’ll continue to do so to help keep people safe. Article One, a specialized human rights and ethics consulting firm, completed the assessment in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The research methodology included qualitative interviews with journalists, child protection specialists and civil society activists, as well as a survey of 2,000 people that use Facebook in the Philippines. The assessment also used an innovative methodology of combining traditional methods of stakeholder consultation with a quantitative survey that captured the experiences of a wide range of Filipino citizens. It was also framed to understand the experiences and risks of a variety of vulnerable groups, including LGBTQ+, journalists and others. The Meta Response: Article One Recommendations and Our Progress The Meta Response outlines our response to Article One’s recommendations. We are committing to implement, or have implemented, 24 recommendations; partly implement 7 recommendations; and we’re assessing feasibility of another 9. We’re sharing these insights and actions from our due diligence, aligned with our human rights policy. As our response notes, we’ve made progress towards many of the recommendations in the report, and we know there is more to do. Here’s an update on our work to address some of the key areas identified in the report: Recommendation: Develop a risk mitigation plan for the 2022 Philippine Presidential Election, with a focus on disinformation. 1.	In line with our approach to other major global elections, Meta has made it a high priority to invest in risk mitigation and preparation efforts for the 2022 Philippine presidential election. 2.	We have a cross-functional working group dedicated to preparing for this election, and have also begun providing resources and training for stakeholders on digital advocacy, community standards, online safety and political advertising. 3.	In partnership with the Philippine Commission on Elections and various civic organizations including the Legal Network for Truthful Elections (LENTE), we launched a civic education campaign, conducted training on our Community Standards, and held roundtables with civil society. 4.	We expanded Digital Tayo, our flagship digital literacy program in the Philippines, to include new modules on civic education, focused on community engagement and empowerment in preparation for the elections. 5.	We’ve significantly expanded our global policies addressing voter interference. We’re working closely with civil society, electoral authorities and the industry, and will provide further updates on our election efforts in the lead up to next year’s vote. 6.	We have taken important steps to expand and refine our policies around misinformation. We launched the Misleading Manipulated Video policy and expanded our Misinformation and Harm policy to remove certain COVID-19 and vaccine related misinformation. Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve removed more than 20 million pieces of content under these policies.

Introducing the National Registry of Physicians: a groundbreaking solution to improve access to health care in Canada JUNE 15, 2023 As the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) continues to work collaboratively in navigating the challenges posed by the current health care crisis, the National Registry of Physicians (NRP) offers a bright prospect. This innovative platform will initially facilitate increased information sharing between medical regulators, streamlining the provision of medical care, and ensuring the highest standards of medical treatment for all Canadians. Join us on this exciting journey as we explore the benefits of the NRP. In October 2022, the Government of Canada under the Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program approved a funding request that will enable the MCC to establish the NRP. This innovative initiative received support from 12 provincial and territorial Medical Regulatory Authorities (MRAs), and we are thrilled that the funding was officially announced on March 15, 2023. Since then, we have received positive feedback from the medical community and inquiries about how this new registry aligns with the overall discussion on national or portable licensure. These inquiries highlight that the NRP is a significant milestone in the integration of health care data in Canada and will serve as an indispensable resource for MRAs, health care professionals, policymakers, and patients alike. The NRP is currently under development, and the project team is receiving valuable input from a working group composed of 18 members from MRAs across the country. These insights are contributing to the creation of a national tool that will comply with provincial and territorial requirements while remaining accessible to all. The NRP will utilize critical data already gathered by provinces and territories, enhancing its usefulness by providing access across jurisdictions. Once completed, the NRP will be a collaborative information exchange tool managed by the MCC for the use of MRAs, with a focus on data management and security. Planned for substantial completion at the end of March 2024, the NRP will be a comprehensive cloud-based database that provides information on all licensed physicians in Canada. It will include their credentials, education, and any disciplinary actions or sanctions taken against them. The NRP will eliminate the need to collate files from multiple MRAs, simplifying the decision-making process for interested parties and users, and facilitating the mobility of physicians. This initiative will showcase the MCC’s commitment to providing excellence in ensuring safe patient care, while leveraging our extensive experience in collaborative information exchange databases. The MCC will serve as a dedicated agent for the provincial and territorial entities, facilitating smooth communication and the timely exchange of accurate data. The NRP will be a dynamic and evolving database, regularly updated to reflect changes in the medical profession. Initially, it will be accessible to authorized users, beginning with MRAs and expanding in the future to the public and other interested parties. Restrictions will be in place for certain sections of the NRP to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of information contained within. The NRP represents an important step forward in the MCC’s ongoing efforts to enhance health care delivery in Canada. Through this initiative, the MCC is demonstrating its unwavering commitment to ensuring the highest quality of care for patients across the country. By providing a comprehensive and accessible database of physician information, the NRP will empower MRAs, health care professionals, policymakers, and patients to make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes for all Canadians. The MCC is proud to lead this groundbreaking initiative and looks forward to the positive impact it will have on the Canadian health care system for years to come.

PRA programs: Top of mind and an attractive option for internationally trained physicians JUNE 15, 2023 More than one in five adults in Canada do not have access to a primary care provider; as a result, medical experts and authorities continue to bring forward short and long-term solutions to address the pressing needs in health care. One proposed solution is to integrate more international medical graduates (IMGs) into the Canadian workforce, particularly through the Practice-Ready Assessment (PRA) pathway that fast-tracks the route leading to a licence for physicians who have completed their medical training and residency abroad. Regarded as a safe and efficient way to bring qualified doctors into practice faster and alleviate the strain on a depleted health care system, PRA programs are being brought into the spotlight at a time when they are rapidly expanding. Numbers on the rise across the board In British Columbia and Saskatchewan, where the PRA route has been established for many years, increased funding from provincial governments is helping programs to scale up and bring more doctors into communities where they are greatly needed. In 2022, the Saskatchewan International Physician Practice Assessment (SIPPA) program increased its capacity, which resulted in 45 family physicians completing the assessment during that year, compared to 36 in previous years. Assessments also increased at a rapid pace for Practice Readiness Assessment (PRA-AB) in Alberta, which assesses both family physicians and specialists. In 2022, the program enrolled a total of 92 IMGs in its preliminary clinical assessment, which represents a 35% increase from 2021. Out of those 92 candidates, 67 participants were assessed under the family medicine stream. Further west, Practice Ready Assessment – British Columbia (PRA-BC) will have the largest increase next year as its capacity will be almost tripling, going from 41 family medicine seats in 2023 to 96 in 2024. Dr. Ryan McCallum, clinical director of the program, explains that the team is currently focusing on planning for the operational changes that may be required to accommodate such a rapid growth. Ms. Mary Chinni, the program’s manager, adds that they are working towards a completely different program model with three intakes a year, from the two currently offered. Another aspect to consider, she notes, is the capacity to host more clinical field assessments and whether there are enough sites to support that influx of candidates so quickly. Increased funding from provincial governments is helping programs to scale up and bring more doctors into communities where they are greatly needed Safe and high quality care at the core Alberta is one of the few jurisdictions where all of the Registration assessments live with the provincial medical regulator, the College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPSA). For Ms. Jill Hastings, the program’s manager, this particularity is one of the big strengths of PRA-AB, since the team benefits from the knowledge and expertise of all CPSA departments. In January 2023, PRA-AB launched a pilot project to condense the assessment process for IMGs with training comparable to that of Canadian universities, waiving the first step of the process (called the preliminary clinical assessment) and facilitating their accelerated entry into the workforce as they complete a supervised practice assessment while working in their practice location. Eligible candidates are still required to do a competency assessment to ensure they provide safe and high-quality patient care. Currently, 86 IMGs are eligible to come through this new accelerated route. Similarly for PRA-BC, Dr. McCallum stresses that even with substantial changes ahead, the program “will not be compromising on the quality in terms of application criteria”. What is clear from consultations, he explains, is that growth must not come at the expense of applicants’ clinical skills. Rather, other areas such as post-program community support and customer service can be refined to make PRA-BC more attractive to skilled applicants. It is also worth noting that, while the assessment process may differ from one province to another, all PRA programs maintain common standards and share similar eligibility requirements, such as passing the Therapeutics Decision-Making (TDM) Examination. Those standards, developed through the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) PRA framework, support programs in their admission and assessment decisions.

The Saskatchewan International Physician Practice Assessment (SIPPA) launches a new post-assessment program JUNE 15, 2023 International medical graduates (IMGs) are an integral part of the physician workforce in Canada, and this is particularly true in Saskatchewan where half of the practising physicians are internationally trained. Approximately 75% of the physicians starting rural practice each year in the province come through the Saskatchewan International Physician Practice Assessment (SIPPA) program, an accelerated route where IMGs complete a 12-week clinical assessment to ensure they have the appropriate clinical skills and knowledge to work effectively and safely in the Canadian context. Having successfully assessed 507 physicians since its inception in 2011, the SIPPA program is valued by the provincial government for the key role its graduates play in improving access to care across rural Saskatchewan. Over the last two years, SIPPA received funding from the Ministry of Health to initiate important changes: in 2022, the program was able to expand its yearly capacity from 36 to 45 participants, followed in early 2023 by the launch of a program to support SIPPA participants after their clinical assessment until they reach full licensure. Investing in better care for patients As physicians coming through SIPPA will be welcomed and working in rural and regional communities across Saskatchewan, the program has been focusing on improving the educational support available to them during the orientation and the assessment period, and on providing more resources specifically geared towards rural practice. Dr. Jon Witt, SIPPA medical director, explains that the team reviewed the assessment’s outcomes over the last two years to look for strengths and gaps related to emergency care, and identified courses that SIPPA participants would benefit from. Thanks to funding obtained from the Committee on Rural and Regional Practice which lives with the Saskatchewan Medical Association, the program started offering new courses in Advanced Trauma Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support, as well as an approved airway course. Dr. Witt is confident that those increased resources will help SIPPA participants strengthen their skills and handle emergency situations more confidently: “There’s a fairly significant resource investment, recognizing that the physicians coming through SIPPA are placed in rural communities where there’s the expectation that they’ll be on call in the emergency department, and ensuring they have the knowledge, skills and training to respond to those emergencies in a competent manner.” He stresses that “there is an understanding across the province of the support these physicians need”, adding that some organizations are now offering dedicated training to SIPPA participants. The importance of assessors As the number of IMGs enrolled in the program is steadily rising, the main challenge for SIPPA and other Practice-Ready Assessment (PRA) programs across the country remains the recruitment of physician assessors. Dr. Witt is grateful for the commitment of SIPPA assessors who support the increased capacity and take on the extra work while managing the workload of their own practice: “They recognize the need for participants to have a robust assessment, and they understand that we have to do this as a team province-wide to support the needs of rural communities.” Expanding support beyond the assessment To better support physicians when they begin working in their community, SIPPA launched in January 2023 a comprehensive post-assessment program. “Prior to this launch, supervision of physicians after their assessment was performed through the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan”, explains Dr. Witt. “SIPPA proposed this program to follow physicians on their post-PRA journey until they reach full licensure”. He points out that this is “an expansion of the SIPPA program’s continuum, as the physicians don’t finish the 12 weeks fully formed and ready to go. There’s still learning, and support and coaching are still happening.” A curriculum incorporating educational milestones from the CPSS as well as feedback from past participants, family medicine leads and Chiefs of Staff was also developed to address knowledge and skills gaps identified during the transition into Canadian practice. Dr. Witt specifies that in the first year post-assessment, physicians are actively engaged in a continuing education program as they participate in simulations and attend weekly sessions on a variety of clinical topics. He adds that some sessions also cover patient and team communication, as well as personal wellness.

Another successful delivery of an in-person NAC Examination ApplicationNAC ExaminationResults OCTOBER 27, 2021 The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) is pleased to announce that thanks to the collaboration between test centres, candidates and the MCC staff, over the course of four days in October 2021, 1,305 candidates completed the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) Examination at nine test centres across the country. This is the third time the NAC Examination has been successfully delivered in-person to candidates during the pandemic. In July, 2021, the MCC announced that the 2021 October sessions of the NAC Examination would be delivered in person at various test centres across the country. As the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and abroad continued, our priority remained being mindful of the impacts of this virus on the medical community and ensuring the safety of all involved in our exams. We worked collaboratively with our stakeholders to make sure that remained the case for the October 2021 NAC Examination. When administering the October 2021 NAC Examination, the MCC adhered to public health recommendations and followed strict provincial vaccination protocols to help ensure the safety of all exam participants. Physical distancing and other personal protective measures, as per the guidelines set by local public health authorities, were implemented at each of the test centres. We would like to thank all candidates for complying with test centre vaccination policies, as well as the Physician Examiners, Standardized Participants (SP) and Exam Staff who took part in the exam administration. Special thanks to the Site Administrators, SP Trainers and Chief Examiners who worked with us so closely. Your collaboration, dedication and cooperation contributed to ensuring a safe, efficient and reliable exam experience for candidates. Results The MCC will be reporting a pass or fail decision, a total score and subscores. Exam results will be available in early December to meet the CaRMS R-1 Main Residency Match deadline. To obtain information on the NAC Examination and the 2022 CaRMS R-1 Main Residency Match, please consult our Application and eligibility web page. Future sessions The next NAC Examination is anticipated to take place in March 2022 and application will open in November 2021. Candidates may submit their email address to receive a notification when registration opens. About the NAC Examination The NAC Examination assesses a candidate’s readiness to enter a Canadian residency program. It is a national, standardized examination that tests the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for entrance into postgraduate training in Canada. The NAC Examination is an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). It consists of a series of stations where the candidate is presented with typical clinical scenarios. For a given administration, all candidates rotate through the same series of stations. Approximately 1,700 candidates challenge the NAC Examination annually.

The MCC takes steps to better support diversity JUNE 5, 2019 Recently, over 2000 candidates took the May 2019 session of the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part II at sites across Canada. This exam is a two-day clinical exam that assesses core competence, knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for all physicians. In this high-stakes exam environment, candidates must go through a strict security protocol to confirm their identity. This serves to ensure the exam’s integrity and security. Following this session, it was brought to the attention of the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) on social media, via post exam session feedback, and through proactive follow up by our exam team, that MCC exam day policies related to confirming a candidate’s identity were not consistently applied by exam site staff at all locations. Some candidates wearing religious head coverings were subjected to extra scrutiny and/or identification verification measures that were more intrusive than those applied for their colleagues. The MCC is taking this issue very seriously. As a leader in the assessment of physicians, the MCC is committed to respecting and encouraging diversity. We believe that every candidate taking MCC exams should be treated equally, respectfully and fairly, regardless of their religion, ethnic origin or needs. To prevent a reoccurrence, the MCC will conduct a review of MCC exam day policies and strike a working group to review exam day practices and policies. Following this exercise, MCC policies will be reinforced with exam site supervisors and during pre-orientation with exam site staff. The MCC and exam site staff will also receive diversity and inclusion training to be able to better support all candidates. The MCC is taking these actions to ensure that moving forward, MCC policies are clear and consistently applied across all exam sites. The MCC invites any candidate who has relevant information for the working group or was impacted by identification measures and did not have an opportunity to fill out an incident report at their exam session, to share their concerns via their physiciansapply.ca account.

A haven for Practice-Ready Assessments in Hanna, Alberta NAC PRAPractice-Ready Assessment APRIL 25, 2019 What happens when a rural medical clinic welcomes a steady stream of candidates for Practice-Ready Assessment (PRA)? “You get to meet people with different backgrounds and cultures. You get to know them on a personal basis as well,” says Shannon McBride, a physician assistant who works with the team at the Hanna Medical Clinic in Hanna, Alberta. “The patients see it as a positive,” explains Tannis Voltner, the clinic’s office manager. “Patients are asked if they are comfortable to see the PRA candidate first, before their family doctor. Only a very small percentage want to see the family doctor only.” The PRA candidates who were assessed at the Hanna Medical Clinic have all been successful, with many now practising in rural communities dotted across Alberta. The world comes to Hanna It all started with the launch of Practice Readiness Assessment Alberta, by the College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA) in 2010. A few years later, at the Hanna Medical Clinic, Dr. Emad Hanna (who coincidentally has the same name as his town) offered to assess candidates going through a PRA. Prior to starting in his new role, Dr. Hanna remembers having enjoyed the required assessor training offered through CPSA. “It is part of my personality. If you are able to do something to help somebody, why not?” he mentions of his role as an assessor. An International Medical Graduate (IMG) from Egypt himself, Dr. Hanna understands how difficult it can be to begin practice in Canada. He also values the training he received from assessors in Glasgow, UK. Today, he is paying that forward. The clinic has welcomed several PRA candidates for three-month assessments each year. Caring for a vast community The program has been a boon to rural Alberta, affirms Ms. McBride. “These days, a lot of the residents want to be in the cities, so we view the arrival of any new doctor who wants to practise in a rural area as a positive.” Located approximately 200 km northeast of Calgary, Hanna is in a large agricultural region. The clinic covers a wide catchment area, as far east as Cereal, south to Cessford and Pollockville, west to Delia and Morrin, and north to Castor, Endiang and Byemoor. Ms. Voltner confirms each doctor sees 20 to 30 patients daily, plus urgent cases. Ms. McBride adds that the family physicians on staff not only work at the clinic, but also do rounds at Hanna General Hospital, a long-term care facility, and a seniors’ lodge. In addition, physicians participate in an on-call rotation at the Hanna General Hospital’s Emergency Department. “We get everything and everyone,” states Ms. McBride. “The area has a lot of seniors, so we see the demands on health care that come with aging.” According to Ms. Voltner, “We have also observed that PRA candidates are keen to get involved in the rural community.” As an example, one PRA candidate brought her entire family to the community. “Her kids had an amazing experience. They made friends right off the bat and went out for Halloween.” Hanna’s recipe for PRA success Ms. Voltner credits Dr. Hanna with much of the success of the PRA candidates. “He is a phenomenal assessor. He is so approachable and takes the time to explain the why and how.” Dr. Hanna says the PRA candidates all do well, but while some are “ready to start right away,” others “need more time in practice.” In addition to assessing, Dr. Hanna directs PRA candidates to use clinical practice guidelines and to send patients for consultations with specialists in cases needing more complex medical judgment. The clinic contributes to the success of IMGs, but it also benefits from it. In addition to Dr. Hanna, one of the other family physicians at the clinic is an IMG. The clinic will soon welcome a new doctor on staff. Not surprisingly, she’s a graduate of a PRA.

We have come a long way — from borrowing books from libraries, buying and reviewing them online to reading and highlighting on electronic reading devices (Kindle) that feel like books but can carry tens of titles without the weight. It took us some time to try, adopt and get comfortable with listening to narrated audiobooks. Some of us are still resisting this change. While books/ebooks have some nostalgia associated with them, audiobooks have made reading handsfree and added a new dimension to reading , tonality. When I searched “Audible” on Google, an a Google Ad popped up stating: “Listening Is The New Reading‎”. Below are the five prominent ways, in which I expect  audiobooks to evolve. 1) Narrator-less Audiobooks While driverless cars steal attention and make more attractive headlines, a nearer reality is one, in which Artificial Intelligence gradually eliminates the need for human narrators of audiobooks. Unlike a few years ago, robots don’t sound robotic anymore. They sound more human as tonality is now infused into the the voice of our digital assistants. Yes, we can still distinguish a computerized voice from a real human’s voice. But, we are not far from making that distinction unnoticeable. The ousting of human narrators will lead to mass production of audiobooks, greater profit margins and faster time to market of audiobooks. 2) Increasing Competition Audiobooks are not competing with books or e-books. They’re competing with podcasts, our music playlists, meditation apps, Youtube, phone calls and even in-person conversations. Thanks to the popularity and convenience of Apple’s airpods, listening is on the rise and so is the ambition of each of the audio apps above. While Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime compete on screen time, podcasts, audiobooks, music apps and phone calls will complete on eartime. 3) Informative → Engaging One reason why some book/ebook readers haven’t yet turned into audiobook listeners is possibly because they zone out. In order to convert these readers to listeners, we may see introduction of a lot more knobs to customize the AI generated narration — from “monotonous” to “dramatic” to maybe “rap music”. Coming back to audiobooks, we can imagine voice emulation would allow us to choose narrators from hundreds of voices — from celebrities to grandpa/ma. 4) Convergence of Media There are book lovers who love to read. Then, there are audiobook fanatics who are glued to their airpods. But, it is not all black and white. Some people prefer reading and listening at the same time. Currently, book, ebook and audiobook purchases for the same title are considered separate. This could be caused by any of the three reasons: 1) poor integration, 2) each trying to optimize their individual revenue, 3) assumption that people always choose one experience exclusively over the other. In future, we can expect audiobooks to be bundled for free (or for a nominal price) with book and ebook purchases. Captions on audiobooks will be the new ebook. Interestingly, Audible is already developing two new features addressing exactly this: 1) Immersion Reading, 2) Audible Captions. 5) Auto-translation Market expansion is not just limited to converting readers to listeners. There’s a massive untapped market of people across the globe who do not prefer to read English, or for that matter cannot read at all. Making stories available for listening in regional languages and accents can open up a huge market opportunity, particularly for the self-help category. Translating millions of books to 1000+ languages in many different accents and voices is something that only technology can scale. Stories and knowledge can transform people, whether it be an investment banker at Wall Street or a fruit seller in Asia. Can you imagine how real-time language translation with Google Pixel buds would change travel forever? But, that’s for another post. If you like this, please give it some love. Do you think I missed something? Did you find any holes in my arguments? Were they pretty obvious? Let me know in the comments.

7 Waking Actions You Can Do to Stay Productive for the Entire Day I use a chrome extension called New Tab Draft which basically turns your new tabs and windows into a type-able notepad. I use it to jot down random thoughts, quick reminders but most importantly, my to-do list. Having your to-do list in a highly-visible and accessible place gives you a constant reminder to stay on track. It’s been highly effective for me because everything I do is on the internet. By having my to-do list the first thing I see when I open a new tab, it’s becomes impossible to even open Facebook or Youtube because it reminds me of the things I should be focusing on. This trick works well with everyone — I’ve seen startup founders use it, kitchen caretakers, mothers, office workers, lawyers, etc. The key is not to overwhelm your to-do list with tasks and focus on solving no more than 3 (preferably 1) major task that day. More details below. 3. Brainstorm 10 ideas I got this idea from a very prolific writer, James Altucher, who says that by brainstorming 10 ideas each day, you force your mind to become more creative. I practice this exercise religiously as a writer. Most of the topics I write down are scrapped, but there’s always one or two out of the 10 that makes for a great piece. I’d suggest anyone, even non-writers, to practice this. If you’re a mom trying to figure out what to cook for dinner, practice writing down 10 things to cook. If you’re a comedian, come up with 10 jokes. If you’re an artist, do 10 quick sketches. The true value of coming up with 10 ideas, besides the improvement in creativity is that it’s a numbers game: supposedly the more ideas you come up with, the more good ideas you can generate. 4. Disable all notifications/Turn phone on silent This is pretty self-explanatory, but it’s something that many people still don’t do at work. Social media notifications, email alerts or any kind of notification in general is a major distraction to getting things done. We click on it, the badge with the red numbers, because our minds are built that way — to feel good when we see that we’ve accomplished a task or received a message from someone. The reason why we feel good clicking these numbers is because our brain releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter that gets released anytime our brain wants us to feel good. It’s the same reason why people drink, gamble and have sex. Disabling notifications are easy — there are generally settings or apps available for most phones that’ll allow you to set notifications to silent or disable them entirely. I use the ‘Do not disturb’ on both my Macbook and iPhone to achieve this. As for things I can’t avoid like Medium notifications (because I write for a living), I use Stylish, a chrome extension that allows you to alter the appearance of a website. It’s for the slightly more technical people, but you basically hide the notifications entirely using CSS rules.

4 Words We Need to Stop Using in Climate Change Conversations Tabitha Whiting Follow Oct 11 I’m not saying that language is what’s stopping us from adequately addressing the climate emergency. But I am saying that it has a part to play, and that some of the words commonly used around the topic of climate change are problematic. Here are 5 of those words. 1. Change Photo by Ross Findon on Unsplash Let’s start with the obvious one: change. ‘Climate change’ is now the most commonly used phrase to describe the long-term shifts in weather conditions and temperature caused by human-generated greenhouse gases. It used to be described as global warming — but, quite rightly, there was a feeling that ‘warming’ did not truly reflect the reality of the impacts this phenomemon is responsible for, suggesting temperature changes alone. ‘Change’, though, has its own issues. The main issue is that ‘change’ is a neutral term. Change can be good, and change can be bad. There’s no urgency, and nothing that suggests climate change is something that with have vast, negative impacts. This is dangerous because it could inadvertently play into the main narrative of climate sceptics — that our earth’s climate naturally fluctuates, and we’re simply in a period of increased temperatures currently, with nothing to do with human activity. “There is a limited semantic ‘budget’ for using the language of emergency, and it’s possible you can lose audiences over time, particularly if there are no meaningful policies addressing the fact that there really is an ongoing emergency.” — Dr David Holmes, director of the Climate Change Communication Research Hub There’s no perfect answer, but it’s important to be aware of the different connotations of these terms when having conversations with others about climate change. 2. Believe Photo by Ran Berkovich on Unsplash “Do you believe in climate change?” It’s a question I see all too often — from Twitter threads to political debates. The problem with this question lies in the use of the word ‘believe’. Belief has no place in conversations about climate change. 97% of the world’s research scientists agree that climate change exists, is caused by human activity, and will have vast and devastating impacts unless we start making drastic changes right now to the way that we live. It’s fact. Proven, scientific fact. There’s simply no room for belief. When we continue to use this word around the topic of climate change, we allow there to be room for belief. 3. Goals Photo by Markus Winkler on Unsplash Whether it’s goals for reaching net-zero or targets set by The Paris Agreement, it’s very common to see headlines focused on climate goals and targets — and usually focused on the likelihood of us missing them. These goals are important if we are to tackle the climate emergency. But when we focus on facts, targets, and statistics, it becomes too easy to dehumanise the climate emergency. What those goals represent are lives. If Western societies fail to reach net-zero carbon by 2050 then we are threatening the lives of those at the front line of climate impacts, and failing to protect our fellow humans. It’s all too easy to forget that when we talk about climate change in terms of goals and targets. 4. Fight Climate action and climate policy are often framed as part of the ‘fight against climate change’. We paint the picture that we are battling with this external force of ‘climate change’ which is overpowering us. The reality is that it is humans who have caused climate change. And it is humans who have the power to halt it. It’s nothing to do with us ‘defeating’ the mightly power of climate change. The power lies in our hands, or rather, in the hands of the oil and gas giants to stop extracting and burning fossil fuels to drive our capitalist consumerist society, and politicians to force them to do so.

Vitamin D for Covid-19: New Research Shows Promise Studies highlight potential life-saving benefits. But some experts aren’t convinced. The study’s findings were significant — “spectacular” even, in the words of at least one expert commenter. A team of doctors at Reina Sofía University Hospital in Córdoba, Spain, split 76 newly admitted Covid-19 patients into two groups. One group got the standard treatment at the time, which included a cocktail of antibiotics and immunosuppressant drugs. The second group got the same standard treatment — plus a drug designed to raise vitamin D levels in the blood. Among the 26 hospitalized people who received standard care alone, fully half went on to the intensive care unit (ICU) because their disease had worsened. Two of them died. But among the 50 people who received the vitamin D treatment on top of standard care, only one person ended up in the ICU. None died. In their study write-up, published in October in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the Spanish researchers explained that their experiment was a “pilot” study that requires follow-up work. But they also pointed out that theirs is not the first piece of evidence linking vitamin D to a reduced risk for severe respiratory infection. Far from it. “Vitamin D supports a range of innate antiviral immune responses while simultaneously dampening down potentially harmful inflammatory responses,” says Adrian Martineau, PhD, a clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London. “The evidence that low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for severe [Covid-19] disease is not definitive, but many lines of research suggest that this is likely.” Martineau was not involved with the Spanish study, but he has published several papers on vitamin D for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. In a 2017 research review, which appeared in the journal BMJ, he and his co-authors concluded that taking a daily or weekly vitamin D supplement is associated with a reduced risk for respiratory infection — especially among those who have low levels of the vitamin in their blood. Martineau and others say it’s very possible — though not yet proven — that a vitamin D supplement could provide a measure of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and Covid-19. How vitamin D may combat the coronavirus Thanks in part to Martineau’s work on vitamin D and respiratory infections, the “sunshine vitamin” — so called because the human body requires UV light to make it — has been the focus of Covid-19 research almost since the start of the pandemic. During the spring, several groups identified apparent associations between low levels of vitamin D and increased Covid-19 risks. Since that time, others have replicated their work. For a study published September 17 in PLOS One, researchers found that a person’s risk for a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection is “strongly and inversely” associated with blood levels of vitamin D. Taken together, these findings suggest that adequate vitamin D levels may help prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection and also keep infections that do occur from growing worse. The mechanisms that may explain vitamin D’s benefits are numerous. For example, macrophages are helpful white blood cells that play a number of virus-clearing roles. “Vitamin D deficiency impairs the ability of macrophages to mature,” says Petre Cristian Ilie, PhD, a Covid-19 investigator and research director at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the U.K. Moreover, Ilie says that vitamin D may increase levels of certain cell enzymes that help repel the coronavirus. There’s also evidence that the presence of vitamin D may dampen elements of the immune system that are involved in the so-called cytokine storm that is associated with severe Covid-19. These are just a sampling of the many ways in which vitamin D may protect against SARS-CoV-2.

Why More Cattle? Well, what does this all have to do with more cattle? We live in a broken world. And we want to come to a sustainable, desirable world like I just described. We want to be wise humans living within the ecosystems. And don’t think that means we will be going back in time, living like cavemen. I’m convinced we will be living in harmony with nature in cities too. But for that to happen, we need a transition period. And the most important part of the transition is the restoration of the soil of our planet. We have been degrading the soil for ages and ages by maximizing our food production without care for the land. We need to increase biodiversity and scientists estimate that at least one-quarter of our species on planet Earth live in the soil. And the damage is so bad by now that farmland and nature reserve land both are very degraded. All over the world. Soil creatures cannot breathe anymore because the layers have compacted. Due to this compaction, water cannot be stored in the soil and plants grow with very superficial roots. I work with farmers in my home country the Netherlands and the first thing we teach in nature-inclusive farming is that we have to prevent more compaction from happening. We have to stop compacting the soil with heavy tractors. If we don’t do that, all other efforts for creating biodiversity will fail. The next steps are natural manure to give enough nitrogen and phosphorous to our soils combined with lots and lots of decomposing organic matter to build up humus. The healthy topsoil that our planet needs so badly. Our agriculture has played a large role in degrading the land. Mindful agriculture can play a big part in restoring our soil to become healthy again. And that’s where cattle and chickens and pigs come in. Animals are an intrinsic part of the web of life. Cattle have hooves and they trample the soil in such a way that compaction is solved in a natural way. Chickens have claws and they love to eat the maggots out of the cattle manure. And pigs just love to turn soil with their snouts. Allan Savory makes the case for more cattle with what he calls Holistic Management. Yes, overgrazing has been a problem degrading our soil. A solution, however, is not to go for less grazing. Allan says we need more cattle and chickens and pigs doing what they do best, graze our grasslands, poo and trample the soil. We need to make sure the cattle need to be in big herds, grazing very quickly. Pooping an immense amount of manure. And then moving on and leaving the land alone for one of two complete years (natural cycles of plant growth). I do agree with Allan very much when he says to environmentalist organizations that they need to work with cattle in Nature Reserves to restore degraded soils this way. Yes, we should. And in this short film, permaculture expert Geoff Lawton gives his perspective on the matter. He gives nuances to Allan’s story that I relate to very much. We need to look at every situation locally and decide what tools of people-and-animal-collaboration works best. Yes, we need animals. There’s not a doubt in my mind that we need animals on a healthy planet. So what about the ammonia farts of cows, you ask? Healthy soil will absorb all. The problem is we don’t have healthy soil anymore… Sorry, dear vegans, I will personally not go vegan. And I do not think that going vegan is a solution to all of our problems. During the transition period, we need to work together. People in teams with animals to make our planet healthy again. And make sure we have enough food for all. And earn a living in our economies. We have to find new ways of being together, producing our human food as well as restoring ecosystems.

Would You Buy A Book For $117? Here’s How I’ll Sell It Who would spend that much on a book? Nobody. But I’m not positioning this as a book. I’m selling hard to find information. Some of it cannot be found elsewhere. The book acts as the vehicle for delivering the info. I’m selling it as a physical book only. $117 sounds like a lot of money for a book. I should also mention you can’t buy it on Amazon or at any bookstore. Plus, it appeals to a narrow audience. Only a few can benefit from the information. None of this seems to make sense, right? It’s hard to find the product. It’s expensive, It appeals to a narrow audience. The format may not be convenient. What am I thinking? It all seems counter-intuitive. The truth is, to sell a book for that much money you need to do things different. Some of it seems puzzling at first glance. Here’s why it works. Narrow The Audience Niche down to a smaller audience with specific needs and desires. You’ll likely find an under-served audience. This audience must feel passion or have a desperate need for what you are selling. For example, let’s suppose you sell a course on dog training. You’ll compete with hordes of others. Most folks seeking out this information will find tons of options. It’s unlikely that you’ll offer something so earth shattering that you can charge a premium price for a book. You would need a different approach. Now, let’s niche down and limit the audience to Catahoula Leopard dogs. You’re now facing a tiny audience. Though small, their passion for these dogs radiates. Only a few providers serve them. If you can fill that gap you hold more pricing power. Narrow The Focus Now we’re facing a handful of competitors. How could we narrow the focus and dive deep into a really specific part of Catahoula Leopard Dogs? What about training Catahoula Leopard dogs for competitive dog shows? Now we’re drilling down into a small but focused area of dog training. A small but fanatical crew of prospects exists. Our audience shrinks but the remaining prospects spend big dollars. That’s our opening. Limit Availability Scarcity drives up demand. Sure, that’s the first lesson in copywriting. If we offer our information in digital format it’s unlimited. A physical book you buy directly from the source screams scarcity. I can state that I’m printing only five hundred copies. Once I sell out they’re not coming back. It’s tough to sell that story on Amazon, even if it’s true. The limited printing gives it a feeling of exclusivity. You’ll be one of only five hundred to possess this information. Your buyer feels a sense of prestige. Oversize The Offer The buyer gets more than just a book. The added bonuses increase the perceived value. You see, the book is just one piece of the overall offer. The onslaught of extras make the price a no brainer. I may even include some limited premium bonuses for the first twenty buyers. Imagine crafting a sales campaign to owners of Catahoula competition dogs. See how specific we can get in our marketing message? You can drill down into the exact needs and challenges they face. Compare that to targeting all dog owners. There’s no way you can reach them on the same personal level. There’s one more advantage of going higher priced with a small audience. I can send a handwritten thank you note to all buyers. Try doing that with a seven dollar ebook.

The social value of a work of art changes as a society change their value systems; thus the changes in artistic styles and in the cultural tastes of the public follow "the manner in which human sense-perception is organized [and] the [artistic] medium in which it is accomplished [are] determined not only by Nature, but by historical circumstances, as well."[7] Despite the negative effects (social, economic, cultural) of mass-produced art-products upon the aura of the original work of art, Benjamin said that "the uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being embedded in the fabric of tradition", which separates the original work of art from the reproduction.[7] Moreover, Benjamin noted that the ritualization of the mechanical reproduction of art also emancipated "the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual",[7] thereby increasing the social value of exhibiting works of art; a social and cultural practice that has progressed from the private sphere of life (the owner's enjoyment of the aesthetics of the artefacts, usually high art) to the public sphere of life, wherein the public enjoy the same aesthetics in a gallery displaying works of art. Regarding the social functions of an artefact, Benjamin said that "Works of art are received and valued on different planes. Two polar types stand out; with one, the accent is on the cult value; with the other, on the exhibition value of the work. Artistic production begins with ceremonial objects destined to serve in a cult. One may assume that what mattered was their existence, not their being on view."[9] The cult value of religious art is in the fact that "certain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the cella; certain madonnas remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the spectator on ground level."[10] In practice, the diminished cult value of a religious artefact (an icon no longer venerated) increases the exhibition value of the artefact as art created for the spectators' appreciation, because "it is easier to exhibit a portrait bust, that can be sent here and there [to museums], than to exhibit the statue of a divinity that has its fixed place in the interior of a temple."[11] The mechanical reproduction of a work of art voids its cult value, because removal from a fixed, private space (a temple) and placement in a mobile, public space (a museum) allows exhibiting the work of art to many spectators.[12] Further explaining the transition from cult value to exhibition value, Benjamin said that in "the photographic image, exhibition value, for the first time, shows its superiority to cult value."[13] In emphasising exhibition value, "the work of art becomes a creation with entirely new functions," which "later may be recognized as incidental" to the original purpose for which the artist created the objet d'art.[14] As a medium of artistic production, the cinema (moving pictures) does not create cult value for the motion picture, itself, because "the audience's identification with the actor is really an identification with the camera. Consequently, the audience takes the position of the camera; [the audience's] approach is that of testing. This is not the approach to which cult values may be exposed." Therefore, "the film makes the cult value recede into the background, not only by putting the public in the position of the critic, but also by the fact that, at the movies, this critical position requires no attention."

The term secular stagnation refers to a market economy with a chronic (secular or long-term) lack of demand. Historically, a booming economy with low unemployment and high GDP growth (i.e., an economy at or above capacity) would generate inflation in wages and products. However, an economy facing secular stagnation behaves as if it is operating below capacity, even when the economy appears to be booming; inflation does not appear. In a healthy economy, if household savings exceed business investments, interest rates fall; lower interest rates stimulate spending and investment, which bring savings and investments into balance. However, an economy facing secular stagnation may require an interest rate below zero to bring savings and investment into balance. The surplus of savings over investment may be generating price appreciation in financial assets or real estate. For example, the U.S. had low unemployment but low inflation in the years leading up to the Great Recession, although a massive housing bubble developed.[8] The idea of secular stagnation dates back to the Great Depression, when some economists feared that the United States had permanently entered a period of low growth.[9] The Economist explained in 2018 that many factors may contribute to secular stagnation, by either driving up savings or reducing investment. Households paying down debt (i.e., deleveraging) increase savings and are spending less; businesses react to the lack of demand by investing less. This was a major factor in the slow U.S. GDP growth during 2009-2012 following the Great Recession. Another possible cause is income inequality, which shifts more money to the wealthy, who tend to save it rather than spend it, thus increasing savings and perhaps driving up financial asset prices. Aging populations (which spend less per capita) and a slowdown in productivity may also reduce investment. Central banks face a difficult dilemma; do they raise interest rates to ward off inflation (e.g., implement monetary policy austerity) assuming the economy is in a cyclical boom, or assume the economy (even if temporarily booming) is in secular stagnation and therefore take a more stimulative approach? An analysis of stagnation and what is now called financialization was provided in the 1980s by Harry Magdoff and Paul Sweezy, coeditors of the independent socialist journal Monthly Review. Magdoff was a former economic advisor to Vice President Henry A. Wallace in Roosevelt’s New Deal administration, while Sweezy was a former Harvard economics professor. In their 1987 book, Stagnation and the Financial Explosion, they argued, based on Keynes, Hansen, Michał Kalecki, and Marx, and marshaling extensive empirical data,[citation needed] that, contrary to the usual way of thinking, stagnation or slow growth was the norm for mature, monopolistic (or oligopolistic) economies, while rapid growth was the exception.[10] Private accumulation had a strong tendency to weak growth and high levels of excess capacity and unemployment/underemployment, which could, however, be countered in part by such exogenous factors as state spending (military and civilian), epoch-making technological innovations (for example, the automobile in its expansionary period), and the growth of finance.[11] In the 1980s and 1990s Magdoff and Sweezy argued that a financial explosion of long duration was lifting the economy, but this would eventually compound the contradictions of the system, producing ever bigger speculative bubbles, and leading eventually to a resumption of overt stagnation.

Many theoretical and empirical analyses of economic growth attribute a major role to a country's level of human capital, defined as the skills of the population or the work force. Human capital has been included in both neoclassical and endogenous growth models.[51][52][53] A country's level of human capital is difficult to measure since it is created at home, at school, and on the job. Economists have attempted to measure human capital using numerous proxies, including the population's level of literacy, its level of numeracy, its level of book production/capita, its average level of formal schooling, its average test score on international tests, and its cumulative depreciated investment in formal schooling. The most commonly-used measure of human capital is the level (average years) of school attainment in a country, building upon the data development of Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee.[54] This measure is widely used because Barro and Lee provide data for numerous countries in five-year intervals for a long period of time. One problem with the schooling attainment measure is that the amount of human capital acquired in a year of schooling is not the same at all levels of schooling and is not the same in all countries. This measure also presumes that human capital is only developed in formal schooling, contrary to the extensive evidence that families, neighborhoods, peers, and health also contribute to the development of human capital. Despite these potential limitations, Theodore Breton has shown that this measure can represent human capital in log-linear growth models because across countries GDP/adult has a log-linear relationship to average years of schooling, which is consistent with the log-linear relationship between workers' personal incomes and years of schooling in the Mincer model. Eric Hanushek and Dennis Kimko introduced measures of students' mathematics and science skills from international assessments into growth analysis. They found that this measure of human capital was very significantly related to economic growth. Eric Hanushek and Smith have extended this analysis. Theodore Breton shows that the correlation between economic growth and students' average test scores in Hanushek and Wößmann's analyses is actually due to the relationship in countries with less than eight years of schooling. He shows that economic growth is not correlated with average scores in more educated countries.[55] Hanushek and Smith further investigate whether the relationship of knowledge capital to economic growth is causal. They show that the level of students' cognitive skills can explain the slow growth in Latin America and the rapid growth in East Asia. Joerg Baten and Jan Luiten van Zanden employ book production per capita as a proxy for sophisticated literacy capabilities and find that "Countries with high levels of human capital formation in the 18th century initiated or participated in the industrialization process of the 19th century, whereas countries with low levels of human capital formation were unable to do so, among them many of today's Less Developed Countries such as India, Indonesia, and China."[60] Here, health is approached as a functioning from Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's capability approach that an individual has to realise the achievements like economic success. Thus health in a broader sense is not the absence of illness, but the opportunity for people to biologically develop to their full potential their entire lives [61] It is established that human capital is an important asset for economic growth, however, it can only be so if that population is healthy and well-nourished. One of the most important aspects of health is the mortality rate and how the rise or decline can affect the labour supply predominant in a developing economy.[62] Mortality decline triggers greater investments in individual human capital and an increase in economic growth. Matteo Cervellati and Uwe Sunde[63] and Rodrigo.R Soares[64] consider frameworks in which mortality decline has an influence on parents to have fewer children and to provide quality education for those children, as a result instituting an economic-demographic transition.

Scientific progress is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of scientific knowledge to accumulate. The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do. From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs. Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of Thomas Kuhn, tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress. Whether other intellectual disciplines make progress in the same way as the sciences is a matter of debate. For example, one might expect that today's historians know more about global history than their ancient counterparts (consider the histories of Herodotus). Yet, knowledge can be lost through the passage of time, or the criteria for evaluating what is worth knowing can change. Similarly, there is considerable disagreement over whether fields such as philosophy make progress - or even whether they aim at accumulating knowledge in the same way as the sciences. Social progress is often improved by increases in GDP, although other factors are also relevant. An imbalance between economic and social progress hinders further economic progress, and can lead to political instability.[12] Where there is an imbalance between economic growth and social progress, political instability and unrest often arise. Lagging social progress also holds back economic growth in these and other countries that fail to address human needs, build social capital, and create opportunity for their citizens. In Italy, the idea that progress in science and technology would lead to solutions for human ills was connected to the nationalism that united the country in 1860. The Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Cavour envisaged the railways as a major factor in the modernization and unification of the Italian peninsula. The new Kingdom of Italy, formed in 1861, worked to speed up the processes of modernization and industrialization that had begun in the north, but were slow to arrive in the Papal States and central Italy, and were nowhere in sight in the "Mezzogiorno" (that is, Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia). The government sought to combat the backwardness of the poorer regions in the south and work towards augmenting the size and quality of the newly created Italian army so that it could compete on an equal footing with the powerful nations of Europe. In the same period, the government was legislating in favour of public education to fight the great problem of illiteracy, upgrade the teaching classes, improve existing schools, and procure the funds needed for social hygiene and care of the body as factors in the physical and moral regeneration of the people.

Jared Diamond and Peter Watson argue that a notable feature of Europe's geography was that it encouraged political balkanization, such as having several large peninsulas and natural barriers such as mountains and straits that provided defensible borders. By contrast, China's geography encouraged political unity, with a much smoother coastline and a heartland dominated by two river valleys (Yellow and Yangtze). Thanks to the topographical structure with "its mountain chains, coasts, and major marches , formed boundaries at which states expanding from the core areas could meet and pause…". Hence, this helps European countries feel "in the same boat". Due to the location of mountain ranges, there were several distinct geographical cores that could provide the nuclei for future states. Another point in Europe’s political fragmentation in comparison to, for example, China is the location of the Eurasian steppe. After horse domestication, steppe nomads (for instance, Genghis Khan and the Mongols) posed a threat to the sedentary population until the 18th century. The reason for the threat is "the fragile ecology of the steppe meant that during periods of drought or cold weather, steppe nomads were more likely to invade neighboring populations". Hence, this stimulated China, which is near the steppe, to build a strong, unified state In his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond argues that advanced cultures outside Europe had developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires. In these conditions policies of technological and social stagnation could persist. He gives the example of China in 1432, when the Xuande Emperor outlawed the building of ocean-going ships, in which China was the world leader at the time. On the other hand, Christopher Columbus obtained sponsorship from Queen Isabella I of Castile for his expedition even though three other European rulers turned it down. As a result, governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly. He argues that these factors created the conditions for more rapid internal superpower change (Spain succeeded by France and then by the United Kingdom) than was possible elsewhere in Eurasia. Justin Yifu Lin argued that China's large population size proved beneficial in technological advancements prior to the 14th century, but that the large population size was not an important factor in the kind of technological advancements that resulted in the Industrial Revolution. Early technological advancements depended on "learning by doing" (where population size was an important factor, as advances could spread over a large political unit), whereas the Industrial Revolution was the result of experimentation and theory (where population size is less important). Before Europe took some steps towards technology and trade, there was an issue with the importance of education. By 1800, literacy rates were 68% in the Netherlands and 50% in Britain and Belgium, whereas in non-European societies, literacy rates started to rise in the 20th century. At the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, there was no demand for skilled labor. However, during the next phases of the Industrial Revolution, factors that influence worker productivity—education, training, skills, and health—were the primary purpose. Economic historian Joel Mokyr has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China. China had both a printing press and movable type, yet the industrial revolution would occur in Europe. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the Republic of Letters. The historian Niall Ferguson attributes this divergence to the West's development of six "killer apps", which he finds were largely missing elsewhere in the world in 1500 – "competition, the scientific method, the rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism and the work ethic".

Relations between Canada and the United States have historically been extensive, given the two countries' shared origins and border, which is the longest in the world. Starting with the American Revolution, when Loyalists were resettled in Canada, a vocal element in Canada has warned against American dominance or annexation. The War of 1812 saw invasions across the border in both directions, but the war ended with unchanged borders. The border was demilitarized, as was the Great Lakes region. The British ceased aiding Native American attacks on the United States, and the United States never again attempted to invade Canada. Apart from minor unsuccessful raids, it has remained peaceful. As Britain decided to disengage, fears of an American takeover played a role in the Canadian Confederation (1867), and Canada's rejection of free trade (1911). Military collaboration was close during World War II and continued throughout the Cold War, bilaterally through NORAD and multilaterally through NATO. A high volume of trade and migration continues between the two nations, as well as a heavy overlapping of popular and elite culture; a dynamic which has generated closer ties, especially after the signing of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988. Canada and the United States share the longest border (8,891 km (5,525 mi)) between any two nations in the world, and also have significant military interoperability Recent difficulties have included repeated trade disputes, environmental concerns, Canadian concern for the future of oil exports, the issue of illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism. Trade has continued to expand, especially following the 1988 FTA, the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the 2020 United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), which has progressively merged the two economies. Co-operation on many fronts, such as the ease of the flow of goods, services, and people across borders are to be even more extended, as well as the establishment of joint border inspection agencies, relocation of U.S. food inspectors agents to Canadian plants and vice versa, greater sharing of intelligence, and harmonizing regulations on everything from food to manufactured goods, thus further increasing the American-Canadian assemblage. The foreign policies of the countries have been closely aligned, yet ultimately independent, since the Cold War. There is also diplomatic debate on whether the Northwest Passage is in international waters or under Canadian sovereignty.[ A short-lived controversy was the Alaska boundary dispute, settled in favor of the United States in 1903. The issue was unimportant until the Klondike Gold Rush brought tens of thousands of men to Canada's Yukon, and they had to arrive through American ports. Canada needed its port and claimed that it had a legal right to a port near the present American town of Haines, Alaska. It would provide an all-Canadian route to the rich goldfields. The dispute was settled by arbitration, and the British delegate voted with the Americans—to the astonishment and disgust of Canadians who suddenly realized that Britain considered its relations with the United States paramount compared to those with Canada. The arbitration validated the status quo, but made Canada angry at London. 1907 saw a minor controversy over USS Nashville sailing into the Great Lakes via Canada without Canadian permission. To head off future embarrassments, in 1909 the two sides signed the International Boundary Waters Treaty and the International Joint Commission was established to manage the Great Lakes and keep them disarmed. It was amended in World War II to allow the building and training of warships.

Tony Reagins, a former scout and GM, has been tasked with bumping those numbers in his role as MLB’s chief baseba  development officer. He’s pledged to build participation at a  levels and has found recent signs of growth encouraging. “Once they have that connection and positive experience with the sport, the chances of them becoming a fan are greatly enhanced,” he said. Baseba ’s biggest hits these days are the numbers found on TikTok and YouTube that have ba ooned the sport to a wider audience. With kids these days holding the attention span of a home run trot, Major League Baseba  introduced a slate of rules designed to speed the pace of play, notably with the introduction of the pitch clock. The average time of game this season is 2 hours, 38 minutes, trimmed from 3:03 last season and 3:10 in 2021. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said the median age of ticket-buyers this season has dipped to 43 years old, which is down from 46 last year and 49 years old in 2021. “We’ve talked a lot about younger audiences and how significant they are for the future of the game,” Manfred said. MLB says national and local TV viewership for teens ages 12-17 is up 11% from last year and noted that 86% of people ages 18-24 and 25-34 said they are more likely to watch MLB games due to the rules changes. Young fans or old ones, ba parks are fi ing up this season with the average attendance of 29,277 up 9% vs. 2022 and total attendance is already 4.38 mi ion higher than 2022. Reagins said the shift in how young people watch baseba  — more in short bursts — has forced the league to adjust at a  levels in how it attracts new fans. “The important part is that they are consuming the game,” he said. Perhaps, though, the addiction to the highlight-reel has lessened the bond between young fans and the need to root, root, root for the home team. Twelve-year-old Grayson Leinart from Waco, Michigan, was also in South Wi iamsport as a fan. The Milwaukee Brewers are his favorite MLB team, but again noted, 2 1/2-hour games or not, “I watch highlights because it’s more interesting.” They’re not alone. Bowman Field wi  be packed with Little Leaguers watching the Phi ies and Nationals but perhaps just as likely catching a sparkling defensive play from an earlier game on their phones. Last year, the Orioles and Red Sox were greeted at the airport by smiling Little Leaguers and they signed autographs -- yes, even the 12-year-olds signed jerseys and ba s for the big leaguers -- and watched some of the early Little League World Series games. Nationals first baseman Dominic Smith wishes he could take more than a day trip to the Little League World Series. The 28-year-old Smith grew up in Los Angeles and is the co-founder of a nonprofit, the Baseba Generations Foundation, that helps provide resources for underprivileged youth involved in the sport. He played in the Little League Classic previously with the Mets and said it’s important for kids to discover that major leaguers are just like them. “Those couple hours that we get to spend with them, I think they’  have a better understanding on how we’re regular human beings, how we have probably the same common interests,” Smith said. “It makes them more hungry, makes them want to work harder so they can get up here and be in our shoes.” Making it to Wi iamsport as a kid was never the top priority for Washington’s 58-year-old, Brooklyn-born manager, Dave Martinez. “I just thought about playing as much as I could possibly play, whether it was Little League, whether it was a pickup game. Back when I was growing up in New York we played a lot of stickba ,” Martinez said. He was excited about the trip and connecting with the next wave of baseba  fans. “I want to pick their brains, too, see what drives kids these days, why they love the game,” Martinez said. He might want to pass his findings on to the braintrust at MLB.

In early 2020, many Canadians noticed the once lush produce sections of their grocery stores were increasingly barren. What many Canadians didn’t notice is the reason for the absence of fresh fruits and vegetables: COVID-19 outbreaks among migrant farm workers across Canada, including in southern Ontario. The outbreaks, and their effect on food supply, reveal the value and vulnerability of the migrant workers, many of whom are hired through Canada’s Temporary Foreign Worker Program. The program, which is set to be altered this September, permits employers to hire foreign workers when no qualified Canadians are available. The initiative has proven wildly popular, and successful applications have increased exponentially in recent years. But so too have accusations of abuse, of workers enduring unsafe workplace and living conditions. Temporary labourers frequently work long hours for low pay and limited benefits, and they often live in employer-supplied, cramped quarters replete with shared sleeping and washroom facilities — the very conditions that increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks and other health threats. Consequently, for the welfare of the workers Ottawa needs to ensure that changing the program doesn't increase the abuse that has long plagued the regime. For its part, the federal government insists the alteration, known as the Recognized Employer Pilot, will do the opposite. According to Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, the pilot will reduce the administrative burden on employers who “demonstrate the highest level of protection for workers,” and allow them to receive permits lasting three years, rather than the current 18 months. The change will come first to employers in agriculture, then to all others starting in January. Rewarding responsible employers could help to protect both workers and ease the paperwork, and Ottawa has also promised to conduct more rigorous assessments before permits are issued. But three years is a long time, long enough for workplace and living conditions to deteriorate dramatically. Government inspectors do monitor employers’ compliance with regulations, but that oversight has itself been substandard. In response to the COVID outbreaks among farm workers, federal Auditor General Karen Hogan issued a scathing report accusing inspectors of failing to ensure employers followed regulations. If the pilot program is to be successful, then, it must be accompanied by improved, vigilant monitoring of employers’ compliance with safety standards throughout the three-year period. That won’t, however, eliminate the problem that makes abuse possible: The power imbalance between employers and workers. That is the product of two factors — employer-specific work permits, and the tenuous immigration status of workers. Employer-specific permits require workers to remain with the employer who hired them, which means some must make the impossible choice of suffering abuse or unemployment. Aware of this, Ottawa introduced the Vulnerable Worker Open Work Permit program, which can grant abused workers a permit that allows them to move to a different employer. But the worker must first complain, something many are loath to do for fear of deportation or reprisals for employers. In any case, by limiting open permits to those who have faced abuse, the program essentially treats abuse as a kind of hazing, an initiation rite workers must endure if they’re to gain entry to the exclusive club of open permit holders.

Home prices posted the second-highest increase ever recorded in a single month after the one observed in July 2006, according to the latest Teranet-National Bank composite index. The index for July was up 2.4 per cent from June, after seasonal adjustments, and marked the fourth consecutive monthly rise. After declining from a peak in April 2022 as the higher rate environment sidelined some buyers, recent rises in the home price composite index have erased some of this correction, the report said. “The deep declines that we saw through 2022 are largely being unwound,” said Douglas Porter, the Bank of Montreal’s chief economist. The Teranet-National Bank index tends to lag other housing market measures in part because it’s more detailed, he noted. Other measures are starting to show some softening in the market over the summer, and Porter thinks that softening will begin to show up in this index going forward as well. “I think what we’re going to see is that this may be the last hurrah for a while for home prices,” he said. July home sales saw their largest annualized increase in more than two years, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported Tuesday. But they were little changed from June as the national housing market showed signs of stabilizing this summer, the association said. Prices could continue climbing in the third quarter of the year, supported by strong demographic growth and low supply, wrote National Bank of Canada economist Daren King in the report. “The deterioration in affordability with recent interest rate hikes in a less buoyant economic context should represent a headwind for house prices thereafter,” King wrote. Porter agreed with King that the housing market will face more headwinds as the year progresses, though high immigration will help support prices. Expectations for interest rates are increasingly that they will remain higher for longer, said Porter, which will be a pressure on the housing market over the longer term. Though mortgage interest costs are contributing to the Consumer Price Index in an “unfortunate side effect” of the central bank’s fight against inflation, Porter said things would be much more dire if the central bank hadn’t raised rates. “You can’t just look at the impact on mortgage interest costs in isolation, you have to look at the overall picture,” he said. “The overall picture is showing that inflation and even underlying inflation has come down over the last year.” Eight of the 11 markets in the Teranet-National Bank composite index were up in July, with Halifax up the most at 4.9 per cent. Vancouver gained 3.9 per cent, while Toronto added 3.5 per cent. Prices fell 1.2 per cent in Quebec City, 0.9 per cent in Montreal and 0.3 per cent in Calgary. Compared with a year earlier, the overall composite index in July was down 1.9 per cent.

In the face of a North American pilot shortage, Canadian discount carrier Flair Airlines is launching a unique training program that will fast-track candidates into the cockpits of the company’s jets. The Edmonton-based carrier says its new airline pilot training program, which will be offered in partnership with Genesis Flight College in Collingwood, Ont., will radically speed up the length of time it takes in Canada for new pilots to get jobs flying large commercial jets. Candidates will enter the program with no previous flying experience and 18 months later will qualify to become first officers on Flair Airlines’ fleet of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, the company said Thursday. A pilot shortage has been brewing across the continent for several years due to a variety of factors including an aging workforce and the rapid proliferation of new discount airlines that are putting pressure on the labour supply. (One of these discount airlines is Flair itself, which had just three aircraft at the start of 2021 but has expanded to a fleet of 21 Boeing 737s, offering service to over 30 cities across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.) But the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated airlines’ already existing labour challenges, delaying and disrupting pilot training across the country while also driving experienced pilots to exit the industry in favour of more job stability elsewhere. International consultancy firm Oliver Wyman has estimated that the North American aviation industry could be short 30,000 pilots by 2032 if nothing changes. “What that means, in my opinion, is it’s the perfect time to introduce a program where we do targeted training to train exactly what we want, how we want, to get the quality that we want for our pilots,” said Grey Cooper, manager of pilot training at Flair. While Transport Canada regulations require a candidate to have at least 250 hours of flying time to qualify for an airline transport pilot license, traditionally, most pilots being hired by major airlines have had far more than that. In fact, Cooper said commercial pilots often spent years flying small planes on regional and northern routes before ever graduating to big jets. “There was more supply than demand for airline pilots. You could end up sitting on a smaller airplane for multiple years before you got the opportunity,” he said. But as pilots become harder and harder to come by, airlines have begun hiring people with less experience — as little as two years flying smaller planes now as opposed to the five or 10 it used to take to get hired as an airline jet pilot, Cooper said. He added Flair’s program meets all of Transport Canada’s regulatory requirements and will adhere to the highest industry standards for training and safety. In addition to pre-screening applicants for aptitude and competence before they ever enter the program, Flair has also partnered with technology company CTS Aero to incorporate state-of-the-art virtual reality tools and flight simulators into the program, Cooper said. While Flair is the first to pioneer the concept in Canada, Cooper said European airlines have many programs that take people with no experience and equip them to get jobs on Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 jets immediately upon completion. “We’re taking proven systems that have worked worldwide and are applying them to Canada,” he said. Flair said it will accept its first cohort of 10 aspiring pilots in January 2024. Students accepted into the program will receive a conditional offer of employment with the airline and transition directly into the airline upon graduation.

When the branch of a Siberian elm tree in Toronto’s Trinity Bellwoods Park broke and fell last month, striking 71-year-old art gallery owner Pari Nadimi, many Torontonians filed this awful tragedy under the category of “freak accident,” what an insurance company might label an “act of God.” After all, terrible events occur every day out of the blue: Nadimi’s death, similar to a 2016 tragedy when another fallen tree branch killed a man in the same park, appeared to be one of these events. But what if these deaths were not inevitable? Not fluke events but the result of chronic mismanagement? In other words, what if the city does a subpar job when it comes to maintaining the city’s vast tree canopy. These are questions that arborists and tree experts are asking in the aftermath of Nadimi’s death—and have been asking for years. Could Nadimi’s have been prevented if the city had better assessed the trees in Trinity Bellwoods Park? Recent reporting by the Star’s Ben Spurr paints an unsettling picture of the tree maintenance program. Months prior to Nadimi’s death, a Toronto resident said he twice alerted city workers in the park to the potential danger posed by the very branch that would later fall and take her life. After the incident, crews removed the tree. City staff later identified a further 16 trees for removal in the park and 21 trees received maintenance including pruning. The city says it gets 40,000 calls related to tree maintenance each year, performs more than 25,000 inspections and prunes more than 20,000 trees. Yet multiple arborists who spoke with Spurr highlighted various problems with the city’s forestry practices from outdated assessment methods to severe over-pruning of mature trees. “There are instances where I turn and I find trees that are pruned in such a way that has me concerned for their health and for their structure because they’re not being pruned to . . . recognized arboricultural standards,” arborist and urban forestry educator Todd Irvine told the Star. The problem with over-pruning, or “lions tailing”—that is the thinning of interior branches, leaving the bulk of a tree’s foliage at the ends of its branches—is that it can weaken trees and make them more vulnerable to dropping limbs in the event of a storm. Other arborists weren’t convinced that was the problem here. It is entirely fair to conclude, in light of recent events, that the city must review how it maintains trees. (It’s estimated there are 4.1 million trees on public land and another 6.1 million on private lands.) Certainly, this latest tragedy underscores the importance of tending to trees, especially as we confront a future of storms made worse by climate change. In 2022, the city saw a significant spike in storm-related calls — 12,701 compared to just under 8,000 in 2020 and 2021. Investing in the proper maintenance of Toronto’s trees is critical not just for the environment but the safety of all those who enjoy city parks and bask in the pleasure of sitting in the leafy shade of a mighty tree.

The dressing-down served up by the British Medical Journal for Canada’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic could hardly have been more scathing. In a series of papers, the BMJ said Canada failed to learn from previous lessons and investigations; left the most vulnerable — particularly in long-term care homes and among marginalized communities — to bear the brunt of illness and death; saw an uncoordinated response within the country and failed to live up to its rhetoric about sharing vaccines with the world. Echoing every parent who ever cut to an erring child’s conscience, the journal expressed disappointment more than anger. “The world expected more of Canada,” said an editorial headline. As of July 18, more than 53,000 Canadians had died of the virus, with lower-income Canadians dying at higher rates. Only public willingness to accept lockdown measures, the report said, and our high levels of vaccination coverage saved Canada from greater calamity. The chief call of Canadian researchers who authored the series was for an independent national inquiry into the COVID-19 response. Few would say the criticism was undeserved and polls suggest most Canadians support a formal probe of the country’s handling of the pandemic. Still, the idea of a formal inquiry may give some pause, especially against the backdrop of the dragged-out wrangling in Ottawa around an inquiry into foreign interference. Some may believe that much of the diagnosis is already well known through myriad existing investigations and studies. Would a full-blown national inquiry delay rather than promote necessary action? Yet there is a strong case for a focused, independent, evidence-based examination that assesses the response to COVID-19 and makes practical recommendations to prepare Canada for the next health crisis. “There are lessons to learn from Canada’s COVID-19 response to ensure accountability for decisions and actions, and to build confidence in the country’s health leadership, which faltered during the pandemic and created a strain on its already beleaguered public health and healthcare systems,” the journal wrote in an editorial. There’s another good reason for an inquiry. In the absence of a fact-based inquiry, other voices not rooted in science or evidence, seeking to revise history in pursuit of other agendas, will take over the narrative. There’s little question that Canada’s imperfect response cost lives and money. If we intend to do better in future, an inquiry would provide an extensive agenda for reform. We need to build stocks of medical gear and protective equipment. We need to streamline mass vaccination plans. We need to refine economic supports, which during the pandemic were developed and rolled out on the fly — necessarily so — at considerable cost. We need to protect long-term care facilities, to address social inequities and imbalances in attention and service, to better plan and prepare and communicate. Many previous investigations have spoken of the need to strengthen leadership, co-ordination, to improve surveillance and risk reduction, and of the importance of stockpiling supplies. The Long-Term Care Commission in Ontario had by 2021 produced a comprehensive critique and to-do list for the province, saying decades of inattention had left such homes chronically understaffed, underfunded, structurally deficient and inadequately regulated. As the late Justice Archie Campbell said in his tragically prescient Ontario report after the 2003 SARS epidemic, the most important lesson learned was that of “the precautionary principle.” That principle holds that “we cannot wait for scientific certainty before we take steps to reduce.” In other words, speed trumps perfection. The greatest error is not to act. Some things of which the BMJ complains are perennials — such as the proclivity of politicians to express grand intentions while delivering limited results as they are distracted by other crises, and the near-certainty of a vast federal nation such as ours finding less than fully coherent answers to any question. The challenge is to keep the issue of pandemic preparedness at the front of government priorities. Both the focus and will must be maintained. That is a political challenge. The scientific case of the high costs of failure, and of the inevitability of another pandemic, is clear. A formal inquiry would point the way to how the country can do better.

The coalition, which includes the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, said the soon-to-be-eight-year gap between reassessments is making it very difficult to produce accurate property tax forecasts for investors who have delayed or cancelled their projects in response to the uncertainty. The reassessment delay may also trigger higher property tax payments for some as municipalities raise tax rates to offset outdated property values, said Raymond Williams, chair of tax policy at the Canadian Property Tax Association, an education and advocacy group that co-signed a July letter to Premier Doug Ford. “In the current scenario where your assessed value doesn’t change to reflect current market trends, then the only option to municipalities who need more revenue is to increase the tax rate,” said Williams, who is also a commercial property tax consultant at Altus Group. News of the government review follows a recent Toronto Star investigation into Ontario’s property assessment system, which found homeowners are paying unfair shares of property tax because the publicly funded Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) consistently under- and over-assesses homes’ worth compared to their sales price. During a reassessment, MPAC will assign new values to properties across the province based on factors such as location, size and construction quality using a valuation date set by the government. Municipalities use the assessment value to figure out how much homeowners and businesses will pay in property tax. The province quietly updated the Assessment Act this week. All assessments conducted in 2024 by MPAC will continue to be based on the valuation date of January 1, 2016. MPAC, a publicly funded non-profit organization that assesses more than 5.5 million properties across Ontario, is responsible for returning an updated assessment roll each year that includes changes such as permitted additions, renovations, new structures or new construction. In 2022 alone, MPAC added more than $37.8 billion to municipal rolls across Ontario through its assessments of new construction and renovated properties. Municipalities pay more than $200 million annually for this service. The City of Toronto alone paid $46.5 million last year. Coalition members say MPAC’s assessment values are becoming “inscrutable” to property owners. The more time that passes between the assessment date and the present, the harder it is for homeowners to figure out their true current value, said Robert Brazzell, a spokesperson for the Greater Toronto chapter of NAIOP, an association representing commercial real estate developers. The link between reassessment delay and inaccurate assessments is real, researchers say. “The most common cause of inaccurate assessments is that too much time has passed with the last revaluation,” states a March 2022 policy brief from the U.S.-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a research foundation whose work informs efficient and equitable tax system policies worldwide. “The longer a jurisdiction goes without reassessing property values, the greater the tax inequities.” The Star’s investigation found that even in 2016, however, when the real estate market was much less inflated, in a sample of 12,000 Toronto homes that sold that year, those who owned the most affordable properties were routinely paying more than their fair share of property tax while those with the most expensive properties were comparatively paying less. Mayor-elect Olivia Chow and the NDP opposition called for a review of MPAC’s assessment system in the wake of the Star’s reporting. MPAC has said it disagrees with the Star’s findings and that several internal and external reviews of its assessments have found that it meets international standards. MPAC says the Star’s reporting is “inflammatory and misleading to property owners when it comes to the quality and accuracy of their assessment.”

Serjiu Juravliov arrived in Toronto from Moldova during the pandemic with a job in hand and the hope of a new life. He’d been promised an hourly wage of almost $35 doing tiling and other renovation work at schools and retirement homes across the GTA. But after racking up hundreds of hours of labour — most of them unpaid — Juravliov knew he needed to take action. So in the fall of 2022, Juravliov filed a claim with the provincial labour ministry. By December, a case officer had ordered his employer to cough up $32,000 in stolen wages. Through freedom of information legislation, the Star obtained a breakdown of every successful claim for workplace violations between April 2020 and December 2022, as well as data on how much the labour ministry recovered of workers’ unpaid money. Similar requests were also made by Parkdale Community Legal Service and Downtown Legal Services, who shared the findings with the Star. Between 2020 and 2022, Ontario workers filed more than 8,400 successful claims for workplace violations such as failure to receive overtime, minimum wage, severance, termination pay, or other entitlements, according to the internal records. The Ministry of Labour found the workers were owed more than $36 million in total. By the end of 2022, government collection efforts had only recovered just under 40 per cent of that money, according to the Star’s analysis of the data. A spokesperson said the Ministry of Labour disagreed with the Star’s analysis, and said the amount of workers’ money recovered is “far higher.” The ministry spokesperson said the internal records the Star analyzed do not include complete data on instances where companies paid orders to compensate workers, one of the tools used to collect unpaid wages. The ministry said it could not provide that information because of how it organizes enforcement data — even though the Star has previously obtained these kinds of figures through a freedom-of-information request. Mary Gellatly, a community legal worker with Parkdale Community Legal Services, said the government’s inability to show how tracks this crucial data is cause for concern. “It makes it much harder to try and have a decent public conversation about what’s happening with enforcement of basic minimum standards in our workplaces.” When workers file wage theft claims, there are several possible outcomes — some much slower than others. Their employer can pay them before the ministry issues a ruling, allowing workers to resolve and withdraw their claim. The two parties can also reach a settlement before the ministry makes any findings, which typically results in workers getting some — but not necessarily all — of their money. If the worker instead pursues a claim and the ministry rules in their favour, the employer can voluntarily comply and pay up. The overwhelming majority of employers choose not to do so, according to the ministry data obtained by the Star. Between 2020 and 2022, less than 10 per cent of workers’ unpaid wages were recovered through voluntary compliance, the data shows. When employers don’t comply, they are issued an order to pay, which they must fulfil within 30 days. These orders to pay are a key part of enforcement, and have long been a sore point for advocates because labour ministry data has previously shown that orders to pay are often unsuccessful. Academic research from 2017 revealed that only 37 per cent of employers fully honoured orders to pay. However, in response to questions for this story, the labour ministry said it could not provide a breakdown of how much money it successfully collected through orders to pay due to how it “stores” enforcement data. Without this information, it is impossible to tell “to what degree the Ministry of Labour is using its enforcement tools to try and force employers to pay unpaid wages,” said Gellatly. When these orders to pay fail, the Finance Ministry takes over collections efforts.

Internal data raises questions The Star’s analysis of the government’s recovery efforts focused on cases in which the Ministry of Labour found a worker was owed money, and how much of that money the province recouped. According to internal data released by the ministry under freedom of information legislation, the province found a total of $36 million owed to workers between 2020 and 2022. It recovered about $3 million through voluntary compliance. When cases where employers didn’t comply were sent to collections, the province recouped another $9 million, according to Ministry of Finance data obtained by the legal clinics and shared with the Star. The Ministry of Finance deemed another $23 million “uncollectable” over that same time period. Altogether, the province recovered close to $13 million of the $36 million it found owing as of December 2022, according to the data. The data does not include any money that may have been recovered after that date. The labour ministry counts the amount it recovers differently. It now includes settled and withdrawn claims in the amount of money it says it has recovered on behalf of workers, which it did not do prior to 2017. Settlements netted workers some $10.8 million between 2020 and 2022, according to the data obtained by the Star. However, neither settlements nor withdrawn claims involve ministry officials making a finding on how much workers are legally owed. As a result, the Star’s analysis treated these as separate categories, as a recovery rate cannot be determined without a finding on how much the worker was entitled to in the first place. Academic research has previously found that settlement outcomes tend to be less favourable to claimants, compared to when a case officer completes an investigation and issues a decision. When looking at settled and withdrawn claims, as well as voluntary compliance, inspections, and Finance Ministry collections, the Labour Ministry says the government recovered a total of $60 million for workers over the past three fiscal years. However, this math doesn’t appear to add up. The ministry included a breakdown of each method of collections in an FOI released to the legal clinics. The breakdown of collections adds up to only $39.6 million. The ministry did not provide an explanation for the $20.8-million gap, except to say the data did not include money that labour officials collected through orders to pay due to its inability to provide that information. The ministry’s breakdown also claims its colleagues at the Ministry of Finance recovered $8.6 million through collections in fiscal years 2020/21 and 2021/22. That’s $1.8 million more than the Ministry of Finance says it collected. Neither ministry provided comment on the discrepancy. In a statement, labour minister spokesperson Sydney Dubin said that “everyone in Ontario should be paid for the work they do” and it uses “every avenue available to pursue the recovery” of stolen wages. “Anyone who thinks they can take advantage of workers is not welcome to operate in our province.”

We needed just two pieces of information to determine that the mansion on the edge of The Bridle Path neighbourhood was taxed as if it was worth considerably less than its market value. Its assessed value pegged it at around $4.6 million. But its sale price was millions more. Finding these pieces of information for this house — and for more than 20,000 other residential properties across Toronto — was far more complicated. It took nearly two years to collect assessment and sale records to build our own data set to see if homeowners are being asked to pay their fair share of property tax. In cities across the United States, property assessment and sale data is readily available to the public at large. Elected assessors share it on government websites. It has been used by researchers who have found U.S. assessors, and the methods they use, assign property values that overtax the working class and favour the rich in many cities. In Ontario, however, that same kind of data is fiercely protected. The agency in charge of valuating Ontario properties, the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC), has a long history of successfully arguing that property owners should be denied their requests to see larger volumes of assessment data and details of its calculations on the grounds that releasing such information would harm its economic interests. The corporation, which is funded almost entirely by taxpayers, has been compared to “the Kremlin” by one Toronto city councillor. MPAC says its work is accurate, fair and easy for the public to access. It says the information it provides online allows homeowners to understand and challenge their assessments. We asked the City of Toronto for a copy of its digital assessment roll — a list of all properties and their assessed values. We were told its licensing agreement with MPAC "expressly prohibits" such data sharing. We wondered if the corporation might be eager to pull back the curtain to show how far it’s come since 2006 when Andre Marin, Ontario’s ombudsman at the time, described MPAC’s valuations as “sophisticated guess work” and noted the “wide margins of error” the industry allows assessors. The agency told us the data wasn’t entirely theirs to give. While sales data belongs to the province, it is licensed to a company called Teranet, which has an exclusive contract to operate Ontario’s electronic land registry. MPAC relies on this sales data to develop property values and said it would need Teranet’s permission to provide the Star with its assessment records. We met with MPAC and Teranet representatives. We explained that disclosure of sales and assessment data was in the public interest. Teranet wanted to know what we planned to report before handing anything over. Until we saw the data, we said, it was impossible for us to speculate on what any story might say. Teranet denied our request. So we found the data ourselves. To see how closely MPAC’s assessed values were to market values, we focused on collecting data on Toronto houses that sold in 2016, the last year MPAC conducted a provincewide assessment update of property values. Ontario’s Assessment Act says assessments must reflect a property’s “current value” as of a specific date set by the provincial government. In Ontario, the current assessment cycle is pegged to Jan. 1, 2016, meaning MPAC’s property assessments should represent prices that unrelated buyers and sellers would agree to as of this date. We sifted through property records to obtain 2016 sales for tens of thousands of residential properties. Finding the assessment value for each of those was trickier. The Star used publicly accessible computer terminals at Toronto City Hall that allow residents to look up assessment records, but only one address at a time. Over the course of a year, we built a data set of roughly 20,000 residential properties. We shared our data with University of Chicago professor Christopher Berry and Illinois-based data scientist Eric Langowski, who have extensively studied the U.S. assessment industry. They analyzed our data set using the same methods they used when studying assessments in thousands of U.S. jurisdictions, including Chicago, New York and Detroit.

As the days get shorter, the nights cooler, this fall’s pandemic forecast is coming into focus. Amid warnings of an earlier-than-expected fall wave and the emergence of yet more fast-transmitting variants, experts say the fourth pandemic autumn is shaping up to be different from previous years. High levels of immunity, gained from a combination of vaccination and previous infection, are helping to protect the Canadian population. And an expected COVID booster, newly formulated to target this year’s most dominant subvariants, will provide a further shield from the virus. While questions remain about how the fall will unfold, experts have given the Star a heads-up on what they know about the new boosters and offer advice on when to get their updated defence. Though we are in a quieter pandemic phase, experts caution that vigilance is necessary as the virus continues to evolve. And, they say, this new round of vaccines remains vital to help blunt a fall and winter wave. “Hopefully we will have vaccines, at least for the highest-risk people, before the real (COVID) activity starts,” said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist and professor of laboratory medicine and pathobiology at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Recent COVID recommendations from national health advisory groups, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI), suggest leading experts believe there will be a substantial COVID season, McGeer said. Updated boosters will target the XBB Omicron subvariants that have been most common in 2023. And it will be a monovalent vaccine, making it different from previous boosters, said Matthew Miller, director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at Hamilton’s McMaster University. “In the past, the boosters have contained both the original SARS-CoV-2 virus — what many people call ancestral SARS-CoV-2 — as well as variants that were circulating at the time,” Miller said. “For example, when the BA.1/BA.2 and the BA.4/BA.5 boosters came out, they contained spike from both those Omicron sublineages as well as the original spike antigen that was in the first generation of vaccines to be approved. “Now, (vaccine) manufacturers seem to be moving away from including that old spike in favour of only including the spike antigen from these more recent Omicron sublineages.” In emails to the Star, Pfizer Canada and Moderna Canada each confirmed they submitted requests to Health Canada in June to update their COVID boosters to monovalent vaccines targeting the XBB. 1.5 variant and are awaiting authorization. The boosters are meant for those six months and older. Neither company — nor Health Canada — would confirm when the vaccines will be authorized in Canada or provide clarity on the approval timeline. However, Moderna stated that, pending approval, the company “will be ready to supply an updated vaccine in time for the fall vaccination season.” And experts, including Miller, agreed with that timing. “Our expectation is that these boosters will likely be available around the time that the seasonal flu shots are available — early- to mid-October-ish,” said Miller, Canada Research Chair in viral pandemics.

The evacuation of nearly 22,000 people from Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories by noon Friday is a shock to the system, not just personally but to every possible system from economic to shelter to firefighting, in the air and on the ground. There is no good news beyond the comparative. In the shocking island fire that destroyed Lahaina in Hawaii, residents were not warned by sirens (in full Uvalde, Texas style, officials are defending the indefensible decision) and had nowhere to run until they hit ocean water, which wasn’t the salvation they imagined. Scientists had warned of the danger from invasive grasses that would feed the fire but little was done. But then scientists had warned about warming oceans too. It is the mini-government American approach, to react rather than plan. So the situation in the Northwest Territories could be worse, one supposes. People were warned. The long chain of vehicles leading out of the city will be able to obtain gas, food and water, all the basics. There are flights for those too fragile to drive 14 hours to Edmonton and elsewhere. The magic of firebreaks — treeless swathes that can halt a fire’s progress — is being made. But on the human side, there is not really anywhere for evacuees to stay for more than a few days. This is the theme of modern times, people on the move because they have no other choice. There is no real way to actively fight these huge fires that have swallowed Canada’s Far North and West. They’re too vast and too fast. Canada needs everything it can throw at the catastrophe but the fires are omnipresent. Margaret Atwood has written that the great historical theme of Canadian life is “survival,” nothing more than that. The Americans can continue their self-destructive quest for boundless freedoms and massive personal wealth. But we know how to contend with a harsh landscape even as we cling to the southern border. Indigenous Peoples have survived quite well until settlers arrived. That huge land filled with trees was a terror that eventually became a form of insurance. On a hot planet turning bakingly hot, we always had the north, we always had somewhere to go. Better yet, it would be cold. Canadians know how to cope with extreme cold. But we may have run out of superlatives. Every Canadian vaguely trusted that they had options should the worst come to pass. We were wrong. We lost the reliable cold. The great treescape is burning. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister convened the Incident Response Group, the emergency meeting designed for extremes. It is quite absurd that most evacuees will stay in Alberta, whose absurd premier has just paused large wind and solar energy projects. Danielle Smith is the sheriff in “Jaws.” There’s no shark! The beach is safe! What will Canada’s forests look like next August? Will there be more roads blocked by landslides, crop damage from drought, insects and disease, intolerable air quality, avalanches, fake snow and houses washed away by floods? Well, yes. Speaking of Danielle Smith and indeed the federal Conservatives, I referred earlier to silent sirens at the Lahaina fire. Officials said Wednesday that the sirens were designed to warn people of tsunamis, not fires and might have sent them driving right into the flames. But the delay meant that that’s where they drove anyway. At that late point there was no good exit.

They were known to each other, the young woman employed at a notorious safe-injection site and the 20-year-old man charged with manslaughter whom she allegedly helped to escape after a lethal gun battle on July 7. That was the day mother-of-two Karolina Huebner-Makurat was slain by a stray bullet outside the South Riverdale Community Health Centre. Any residual trust — and there was little of that — between the community and the centre has been shattered with the shocking arrest Monday of Khalila Zara Mohammed. Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is now before the courts, have told the Star that Mohammed, 23, and Ahmed Mustafa Ibrahim were acquainted, although the exact nature of their relationship is unclear. Mohammed was working that afternoon when three men exchanged gunfire outside the Leslieville facility. Not only did Mohammed allegedly abet Ibrahim’s escape in the chaos immediately after the shooting, but she also assisted the suspect “on subsequent occasions” as he eluded police for five weeks, and “lied” to investigators during interviews, according to one of the sources. So many of the social ills plaguing Toronto have come together in a confluence of harm, violence and outrage in this one horrific incident from a summer’s day: Bail in a revolving-door justice system, useless pledges to abide by conditions for those released on recognizance, brazen street crime, and the cascading impacts of supervised injection sites located within residential neighbourhoods exposed every day to the seedy consequences of malign behaviour. Harm reduction here is harm escalation there. Lives saved here — allowing addicts to use drugs in a controlled and safe environment, under the watch of trained nurses — and a life lost there, even if defenders of this specific safe-injection site claim claimed there was no connect-the-dots link between the facility and the murder of Huebner-Makurat. That is a shaky contention, particularly with the arrest of an employee who, as the centre has confirmed, was placed on leave Aug. 9 for purportedly unrelated concerns. Except nothing the centre’s administrators say now can be taken on faith, any more than their insistence that they share the community’s long-festering concerns. As was evident from community meetings held before and after the shooting, these are not residents with a knee-jerk opposition to safe injection, worried about property values. What they’d sought, pleaded for, was proper management, communal engagement, accountability and assurances of safety. They worry about their kids witnessing open drug use — which does not take place solely inside the centre, as clients can get their drugs to go or bring the substances in for lab testing, amidst an opioid crisis where many street drugs are laced with deadly fentanyl. They worry about dirty needles and other paraphernalia underfoot. They worry about overt sex-for-drugs. They worry about the traffickers who congregate around the facility like buzzards. Fletcher has used her influence to meet some of the community’s demands, such as clearing out a laneway that runs behind the centre, where the drug-addled would routinely cluster. The Toronto Police Service has responded through its Crime Prevention Environmental Design component, which advises on reducing crime in the theory that a built environment influences behaviour. But it’s the centre that has direct responsibility for a 15-metre perimeter around the building. South Riverdale was among the first three federally approved “supervised consumption sites” that opened near the end of 2017. There are now at least eight such sites across Toronto, according to the city’s website. Some are more visible than others, and more problematic. In May, a 40-year-old man was fatally stabbed in front of the Works, an injection site at Dundas and Victoria streets. If the Toronto Board of Health gets its way — they’ve asked Health Canada to decriminalize all illegal drugs for personal use in the city — the emanating social complications will increase precipitously. Just as the drug exemption granted all of British Columbia early this year has proven to be a disaster, especially in Vancouver’s drug- and crime-infested Downtown Eastside..

Summer has a way of flying by, so it may come as a surprise that Saturday marks one month in office for Mayor Olivia Chow. And almost as if to mark that occasion, a meeting at City Hall on Thursday just about concluded the preliminary transition period to her leadership for city council, formalizing her governing team by assigning the members of city council to committees and boards. In her speech kicking off that meeting, Chow recalled her own days on city council in the chaotic early days of amalgamation. She said she approached Mel Lastman — of whom she was expected to be a key opponent — about how they could work together. He asked her what she was passionate about, she recalled, and she said children. So he made her the children’s advocate and let her loose to start projects that would make their lives in the city better. Chow was describing a philosophy of leadership that explains why many of her appointments to important roles may seem to put rivals in her inner circle: Jennifer McKelvie, who was John Tory’s right-hand woman and who endorsed Ana Bailão against Chow for mayor, retains the ceremonial title of Deputy Mayor and continues to chair the pivotal infrastructure committee; Shelley Carroll, who also endorsed Bailão, will be budget chief; Brad Bradford, who at times seemed to be running his own mayoral campaign as a sort of Chow-seeking missile attacking her, will be vice-chair of the planning and housing committee, and got a special shout-out in her announcement for his expertise and commitment to the file. Likewise former police officer Jon Burnside will sit on the police board; veteran wild card Mike Colle will be a ceremonial deputy mayor; Frances Nunziata (who Chow’s allies at Progress Toronto vigorously opposed in the last election) will remain as council speaker, a job she seems to genuinely love, even if no one else really wants it. Each of them endorsed someone else for mayor. As I understand it — and as Chow explained it to the Star’s editorial board when she visited during the campaign — the strategy here is not so much about “keeping your friends close and your enemies closer” as it is about giving potential opponents roles that allow them to pursue the things they are passionate about, which keeps everyone rowing in the same direction. It’s a stark break from how Tory approached appointments, in which councillors like Gord Perks and Josh Matlow were kept far away from any role where they might influence the files most important to them. Speaking of those two councillors, their roles after Thursday may be worth a closer look. Some observers on social media were commenting Thursday that it appeared Matlow — a mayoral candidate against Chow — was being left out by not chairing any committees. But he is on Chow’s executive, and will sit on the TTC board and the planning committee, which were the three things he listed as wanting to do in his formal requests. He’s tweeted he’s grateful to play that role, and Chow says he’s in her “inner team.” Maybe there’s some drama behind the scenes, but from what I see there’s every chance he’ll be a significant player in this government. Perks heading up the housing file is interesting in part because he’s been a vocal skeptic of the private-sector supply-side strategy that has dominated discussion of how to approach the housing crisis for years. That he’s been an advocate of public housing and rent controls actually dovetails quite neatly with much of Chow’s housing platform. But seeing him paired with private-build enthusiast Bradford as the chair and vice-chair of the file sets up a kind of odd-couple scenario: will these two combine like Jack and Mrs. Spratt of the famous rhyme to be a super-pair handling different specialties, accelerating progress with their differing passions and expertise? Or will they fight each other to a standstill?

By rights, the unravelling of the Greenbelt should now trigger the undoing of Doug Ford. Yet for all his wrongdoing, the premier has yet to pay a price for his political sins. Will he now? Will he ever? Not so fast. Consider how, even after an incriminating video leaked out in 2018 of Ford vowing to bulldoze those protected lands, Ontarians still gave him a free pass in that year’s election. Back then, voters took him at his word when he quickly renounced that secret plan, promising to leave the Greenbelt untouched. He has been coasting in power ever since. But after winning his second election in 2022, Ford reversed himself for the second time. Will voters once again forgive Ford’s double talk — and forget his double cross — when they judge his actions next time, as they did in 2018 and again in 2022? There is reason to believe times have changed. And that time is running out for the premier. Political victory is rarely predictable. But defeat is often foreseeable for opposition parties that fail to prepare seriously. Unfortunately for New Democrats, their party has yet to gain traction under its new leader, who won her position uncontested and thus remains unfamiliar (name check: Marit Stiles). Unfortunately for both the NDP and Ford’s Tories, a hotly contested Liberal leadership race is now underway, will soon gain momentum, and will culminate next December. If this is prime time for the Greenbelt scandal, it is also a perfect time for the Liberals to make the most of it — and run with it. The opposition is seizing the opportunity. An auditor general’s report this month condemned the contorted, corrupted process, estimating a potential $8.28-billion windfall for “favoured” private developers. If voters weren’t riled up a year ago, they are raging today, according to Nate Erskine-Smith, the Toronto MP who is one of five candidates for the Liberal leadership. “People shrugged their shoulders in the last election,” he mused. “They said, ‘Ford wasn’t as bad as I thought he was going to be.’” More importantly, Erskine-Smith argues, the Liberals weren’t as good as they needed to be. Voters looking for an alternative to Ford had little to look at — but that’s changed with the Liberal revival and the Tory betrayal. We shall soon see whether voters see any difference as the Liberal race heats up. The first of five official debates begins next month, and all five candidates are coming to the first public debate in Toronto that I’ll be hosting for the Democracy Forum at Toronto Metropolitan University on Sept. 20. When it comes to the Greenbelt, Ford’s political problem is not merely his latest proposal but his past promise. He will not only be weighed down by the burden of a Greenbelt bonanza that is benefiting favoured developers — he will also have to explain to voters how he can be trusted after promising explicitly not to do what he did. Let’s re-examine the secret recording and the public record. In early 2018 while running for the Progressive Conservative leadership, Ford confided behind closed doors that he would “open a big chunk” of the Greenbelt if he became premier. “We need to open that up and create a larger supply.” When word leaked out, Ford gave his word that he would do no such thing. “The people have spoken,” he mused. Spoken like a man of the people. “I’m going to listen to them, they don’t want me to touch the Greenbelt. We won’t touch the Greenbelt. Simple as that.” Ever the populist, he promised the people they had the final say: “There have been a lot of voices saying that they don’t want to touch the Greenbelt. I govern through the people; I don’t govern through government.” Back then, Ford had just won the Progressive Conservative leadership. The premier of the day, Kathleen Wynne, warned Ontarians that Ford was not to be entrusted with a public trust. “When that land is gone, it’s gone forever. You cannot get that land back,” Wynne cautioned. “The point of the Greenbelt is to keep in place the integrity of water systems, the integrity of agricultural land.” Wynne pointed out that there was already enough land in the region “to build two more cities the size of Mississauga” without gutting the Greenbelt. Years later, an advisory panel created by the PC government reached precisely the same conclusion, yet was similarly ignored.

Bo Bichette is back with the Blue Jays and not a second too soon for a team that lost its firm grip on a wild-card spot while he was away. Bichette hasn’t been officially activated from the 10-day injured list, but he rejoined his teammates prior to Friday night’s series opener against the Reds and is expected to play Saturday. Barring any setbacks, it would mark his first appearance since leaving with a right knee injury on July 31. When Bichette got hurt, the Jays had a 3 1/2-game lead over the Seattle Mariners for the final wild card. After the Jays lost 1-0 to the Cincinnati Reds on the eve of his potential return, the Mariners pulled even pending the outcome of their game against the Houston Astros. The Jays went 8-8 without Bichette, whose absence overlapped with injuries to closer Jordan Romano, reliever Trevor Richards, centre-fielder Kevin Kiermaier and third baseman Matt Chapman. Romano returned earlier this week, while Richards and Kiermaier were activated Friday. Outfielder Nathan Lukes and reliever Jay Jackson were optioned to Buffalo to make room. The hope is that the return of the 25-year-old Bichette will help the Jays do more than that. He has been the Jays’ best player this season, and a lineup that has been starved for offensive production much of the year desperately requires his potent bat. Even though Bichette has yet to play this month, he entered Friday as the American League leader in hits with 144. He ranked second with a .321 average and first on the Jays in on-base plus slugging percentage at .846, while trailing Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (18) for the lead in home runs by just one. Chapman has been worth more wins above replacement. But if the vote were held today, few could argue against Bichette being the team’s most valuable player. During a down season for Guerrero, Bichette has become the heart and soul of the lineup and one of its only consistent producers. His imminent return also gives the Jays one of the biggest upgrades possible on the diamond. He’ll bring consistent production to a spot in the order that has become a black hole in recent weeks. Even if Bichette takes time to settle in, his presence alone will provide more value than what the Jays were getting. During Bichette’s absence, fill-in shortstop Paul DeJong was a lost cause at the plate. He was acquired at the deadline from the St. Louis Cardinals to provide solid defence and the seven-year veteran delivered that, but his offensive contributions were non-existent. Since entering the starting lineup on Aug. 2, DeJong had three hits (all singles) while striking out an astonishing 18 times without a walk in 44 plate appearances. He has been as close to an automatic out as it gets. Bichette certainly isn’t that, and the Jays need the boost he figures to provide. The Jays entered Friday ranked 17th in the majors with 63 runs this month. On the season, they’re 16th with 4.48 runs per game, well below expectations. Don’t expect Bichette to be eased back in. He’s here to play and, outside of an occasional game or two at designated hitter, there won’t be too many times when DeJong finds himself back at shortstop. “Bo, if he’s back, he’s going to be expecting to play a full game,” Schneider said Wednesday. “That’s our expectation, too. Within that, whenever he does come back, there will probably be a day when he DH’s or something like that.” Bichette appeared in two rehab games for Triple-A Buffalo. On Wednesday, he went 2-for-3 as the DH and tested his knee by scoring from first on a double by Ernie Clement. On Thursday, Bichette went 2-for-2 with a home run and three RBIs while playing six innings at shortstop. The Jays need that production at the big-league level, and they’ll be hoping to get similar contributions from Kiermaier and Chapman. Kiermaier hadn’t played since Aug. 6 because of a laceration on his right elbow, while Chapman had been out since Aug. 12 with a finger injury.

The most ambitious bid to rescue the global oil industry ever seen has been swept aside by a brutal wave of demand destruction. Less than two weeks ago, the world’s biggest oil producers — in a deal facilitated by U.S. President Donald Trump — agreed to slash output in the hope of defending energy markets against the ravages of the coronavirus outbreak. Yet Monday’s historic slump, in which crude prices fell below zero in the U.S., made the OPEC cartel and its partners painfully aware of the limits of their powers. Some nations in the group are desperately searching for any additional steps they might take to stem the rout, but they have few options. “The OPEC+ leadership is currently engaged in serious crisis management conversations,” said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC. Yet “there is little that OPEC+ can do to arrest the demand collapse.” Early start Algeria, which holds the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ rotating presidency, has proposed bringing forward the supply cuts — due to begin on May 1 — to take effect immediately, according to three people familiar with the matter. But there was no sign that the move was backed by OPEC’s key members, or would even make much difference at this point. Though the production cutbacks pledged by OPEC+ are historically large, at just under 10 million barrels a day or about 10 per cent of world supply, they’re completely dwarfed by the immensity of the demand loss. Consumption will be down by 29 million barrels a day this month, according to the International Energy Agency — more than all the crude pumped by OPEC’s 13 members. The severity of the price collapse is prompting some OPEC ministers to get on a conference call on Tuesday for informal discussions about the market. Saudi Arabia’s cabinet said it is ready for more measures to ensure market stability in cooperation with other OPEC+ nations, echoing a joint Riyadh-Moscow statement last week. But it’s unclear whether the kingdom really has the appetite, or the ability, to cut production deeper. The latest production agreement requires considerable sacrifice from the Saudis, squeezing output to the lowest since 2011 and potentially offering its U.S. shale rivals the lifeline of a price bump. For others in the accord, such as Russia and Iraq, it’s highly uncertain whether they’ll even deliver the ambitious supply curbs already agreed on, let alone commit to further reductions. Both exporters had a poor track record in implementing OPEC+ agreements over the past three years. The Kremlin on Tuesday was dismissive about the implications of the price collapse on Russia’s economy, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov telling reporters “there’s no need to give this an apocalyptic tinge.” Rather than step up its efforts, OPEC and its partners may simply need to stick to the agreed plan and weather the storm. That will push the burden of adjustment onto other producers, such as the U.S., Brazil and Canada, which have so far offered OPEC+ little more than moral support. “We’ve reached the stage where this is pretty much outside the control of anybody,” Martijn Rats, oil analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a Bloomberg television interview. “There is no group of suppliers that can offset this through production cuts.”

Nada and his family live in a palatial $11-million mansion with a basketball court, swimming pool and golf simulator — all indoors. One lawsuit alleges Nada has a Maserati Quattroporte and a Lamborghini Aventador, a “very expensive collector’s car.” Meanwhile, licence plate records show he drives a Lincoln Navigator SUV, while a Maserati with the plate “IDEALDEV” is registered to the firm. Nada said he aimed to build Modern Manors on time and on budget, but he was unable to meet the financing conditions for the loans he took out for the project. He denies accusations of fraud and unjust enrichment alleged by buyers now suing the developer, including some Nada alleges are trying to use the media “to extort more money from me.” Modern Manors — what was supposed to be a Richmond Hill condo and townhouse development nestled into a lush forest off Yonge Street — was a victim of a “perfect storm” of permit delays, skyrocketing building costs, provincial tax legislation on foreign buyers and many other factors, Nada said in an email. This led to the cancellation of 72 purchase agreements, one of which was with Pires. The Modern Manors development — cancelled this April — was just one of nine multi-dwelling projects Ideal has started since 2015. Ideal transferred or sold two to other developers, and three others remain unbuilt. Nada said he expects construction of two of the developments to begin this year. Nada said Ideal lost more than $10 million on Modern Manors and he has used millions of his own money to repay deposits. “That is the type of person I am, and the type of company I operate,” he said. While he did not comment about his or his firm’s luxury cars, Nada said he sold the mansion in 2020 to free up cash to help pay his debts and he now rents from the new owner. Ideal’s website said the 22,000-square-foot, six-bedroom house is the “ultimate of perfection.” The buyer of the $11-million house was Nada’s business associate, and the sale may have been a scheme for Nada to shield assets from creditors, alleged a 2020 lawsuit. Ideal and Nada did not respond to the lawsuit, and a judge ordered he pay the plaintiff $150,000. In an email to the Star, Nada said he did not file a defence because he was already “working collaboratively to negotiate a resolution,” adding that he and the plaintiff settled the case. Nada said the allegations that he was shielding assets from creditors were “pure speculation” and “clearly fabricated to enhance a lawsuit.” Nada also denied the plaintiff’s allegation that “it’s a pattern” of Nada’s to avoid paying debts by “always asking for more time” to pay back while he “has money and lives in luxury.” For Bob Aaron, a Toronto real estate lawyer and a freelance contributing columnist to the Star, “One cancelled project is one too many.” While there are many legitimate reasons for project failures, Aaron said the government should prevent developers from cancelling if they failed to get the construction financing in order. Instead, developers should have a limited time in which they can cancel for financing reasons — a year, 18 months or two years. After that the developer should have to buy the units at fair market value, Aaron added. After arriving in Canada from Sri Lanka as a 19-year-old refugee, Nada said he worked hard to build companies that operate with integrity and provide leadership opportunities for women and people of colour. The sleek website for Nada’s Markham-based Ideal Group presents a multimillion-dollar conglomerate involved not just in development but venture capital and global entertainment. According to Ontario’s Home Construction Regulatory Authority (HCRA), Ideal has completed two condominium projects: a 95-unit development in Toronto in 2017 and a 44-unit community in Scarborough in 2013. Most recently, Ideal constructed and sold nine houses in 2019 and one house in 2020, according to HCRA. Perhaps Ideal’s most ambitious project was Markham Square, expected to have a total of 673 units in Unionville.

If Toronto wants to consider new revenue tools to escape pandemic financial ruin, including a city sales tax, it might have to wait for a new provincial government. Within hours of city staff releasing a report Thursday suggesting a host of targeted levies to erase a portion of the city’s massive budget shortfall, while warning that to be financially sustainable Toronto would still need provincial permission for measures like a sales tax, Premier Doug Ford flatly rejected the call. In a statement Ford said his government is focused on keeping a lid on Ontarians’ expenses, “especially at a time when the cost of living is going up.” If Toronto wants to consider new revenue tools to escape pandemic financial ruin, including a city sales tax, it might have to wait for a new provincial government. Within hours of city staff releasing a report Thursday suggesting a host of targeted levies to erase a portion of the city’s massive budget shortfall, while warning that to be financially sustainable Toronto would still need provincial permission for measures like a sales tax, Premier Doug Ford flatly rejected the call. In a statement Ford said his government is focused on keeping a lid on Ontarians’ expenses, “especially at a time when the cost of living is going up.” Some Ontario Liberal leadership candidates vowed on Friday that, if elected premier, they would give Toronto a sympathetic ear and consider giving it and other cities a new funding framework. Coun. James Pasternak (Ward 6, York Centre) said the only way a sales tax could be implemented without kneecapping Toronto retailers would be to impose it region-wide. “I think if you can get the other municipalities (in the GTA) to come on board .... then there might be something there to support,” he said. Pasternak said a foreign buyer land transfer tax may be worth exploring if it could be applied in a way that didn’t discourage investment. But he wouldn’t back a parking levy. “Our retail and commercial sector is so fragile after the pandemic you don’t want to do anything that could hurt that economic activity,” he said. Coun. Alejandra Bravo (Ward 9, Davenport) said that both Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to reverse the province’s downloading of costly services like transit operations onto the city three decades ago. “It is a broken relationship between the senior orders of government and the municipal level,” she said. Bravo said it would be premature to predict which new taxes council might approve, but argued that “(we) have an obligation to consider all of them.” Coun. Stephen Holyday (Ward 2, Etobicoke Centre) agreed with the report’s recommendations to seek a fairer deal on costs that fall within provincial and federal jurisdiction. But Holyday said new parking or sales taxes would be “short-sighted,” and push business away from Toronto when the city is already struggling to recover from COVID-19.

The United States is now in an era in which its democratic foundations are profoundly imperilled, the work of the agent of carnage known as Donald Trump. Our neighbour is witnessing an unprecedented test of that democracy, one that threatens to become much more dire in the coming months. Worse, it is potentially being normalized because an electorate has been numbed by constant exposure to a man who has made the bizarre, the unimaginable and the criminal part of the daily news cycle for years. In total, Trump faces 78 charges, comprised of 44 federal charges and 34 state charges. He has been criminally charged in New York, Florida and the District of Columbia and pending charges in Georgia will add to the total. His civil trials included a conviction for sexual abuse which the presiding judge defined as “rape.” The most serious of these allegations, of course, deal with his attempts to deny and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and include specific charges of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the congressional confirmation of Joe Biden’s victory) and obstruction of that confirmation, specifically inciting a crowd to storm Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, one of the darkest days in U.S. history. The charges relating to his actions after losing the 2020 election results stand as a seminal moment in U.S. history and deal with what federal prosecutor Jack Smith called a bedrock function of government, to peacefully collect, count and certify election results. “The crimes indicted are an order of magnitude beyond anything that has been committed against this country by any American citizen, let alone a former president,” Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law expert at Harvard University, told the Washington Post. Yet the former president may be president again. He holds a commanding lead of 37 points over his nearest competitor in the race for the Republican nomination for next year’s presidential vote and appears to be running neck-and-neck with incumbent Democrat Biden. Almost seven in 10 Republicans still believe Biden’s victory was illegitimate and those clinging to that lie believe the prosecution of Trump is a Democrat plot to destroy his 2024 presidential ambitions. Should he prevail next year, Trump could either pardon himself if he has been convicted (although it is unclear if he can do that) or direct his justice department to dismiss any outstanding charges. If another Republican wins the White House, Trump would likely be able to persuade him or her to pardon him, given the cowardly fealty most of his competitors give to Trump’s argument that the Biden White House has “weaponized” the justice department to keep him from returning to power. Canadians cannot treat this as a spectator sport. American trends, including the least desirable, have a history of bleeding over the border. We have already had an extended occupation of the capital and there have been too many instances of our political leaders being called the most vile of names and being accused of the most disgusting of crimes during public appearances. Our democracy is facing threats from foreign interference. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been in constant attack mode since he won the leadership, but the responsibility to dial down our political dialogue from venom to healthy debate rests with all our leaders. Our neighbours are on a perilous path. We need not follow. But it will take enlightened political leadership to ensure we don’t hit the same ditch.

Every January 1, my family and I take turns going around the dinner table revealing our new year’s resolutions. Typically, these are well-intended aspirations to try and improve ourselves and the world around us in some small way. We write them out on a piece of paper and discuss how we will hold each other accountable for achieving them. Well, this year, the IPC has made a new year’s resolution too. We’re aiming to improve our privacy and access outreach to children and youth, with a view to empowering Ontario’s next generation of digital citizens. In committing to this resolution, the IPC is starting 2023 with a new Youth Advisory Council! This group of highly-engaged youth will help guide my office in developing education and outreach materials that are more relevant to young people and will hold us accountable for it! I’m very excited to announce the members of our new Youth Advisory Council. I look forward to convening this unique forum where they can share their views about digital literacy, access, and privacy rights in Ontario. We’ve brought together ten incredibly impressive young people, ranging in age from 15 to 24, from different communities across the province, and from diverse backgrounds, experiences, and outlooks. At school, their academic pursuits range from science and technology to business, law, and social justice. Outside of school, they all find time to give back to their communities and participate in sports and other activities. Among our council members, we count a violinist with the Hamilton Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and a founder of a model United Nations club. Others are involved with their local Indigenous Friendship Centre, participate in their high school’s Black student union association, or serve in a mentor role for 2SLGBTQ+ students. Reading their applications, what really struck me, though, was the common thread connecting them all. They each expressed the desire to work with others to make the world a better place, including a desire to contribute to the development of tomorrow’s digital citizens. Children and Youth in a Digital World is one of four strategic priorities guiding the work of the IPC. It’s the foundation of my office’s commitment to championing the digital literacy and digital rights of young people, while holding public institutions accountable for protecting the children and youth they serve. We’ve done a lot recently by engaging with youth advocacy groups, developing materials like Privacy Pursuit! Games and Activities for Kids, and launching a new youth-focused Instagram page. We’ve dedicated several episodes of our Info Matters podcast to privacy and access issues among children and youth, and held our 2022 Privacy Day event on the theme of Children and Youth in a Digital World. But through all of these initiatives, a key ingredient was missing. The voices of young people! Today’s youth have grown up online, and no one knows or understands their needs, desires, fears and challenges better than they do. Their fresh perspectives are an invaluable resource for supporting the IPC’s efforts to promote digital literacy and expand digital privacy and access rights for youth in a way that is relevant and meaningful to them. With the input from the IPC’s Youth Advisory Council, I feel more confident that we can make a real difference in the lives of Ontario’s children and youth. By equipping them with the tools and resources, they will be better able to protect their privacy, safety and dignity online as they grow, learn, and mature into adulthood. Someday when we look back, I want to say that we’ve succeeded in guiding this next generation through the opportunities and risks of the online world. By broadening the conversation and engaging young people with a seat at the table, we can learn from them. Hopefully, by listening and learning, we can achieve our new year’s resolution to make the digital world a better place for our children, and for future generations to come.

Every once in a while, there are privacy investigation decisions that stand out because of their precedent setting nature. One such decision is PHIPA Decision 175, which details an investigation into the sale of de-identified data by a health information custodian to a third-party corporation. My office initially became aware of the situation through an article in the Toronto Star, and we launched an investigation under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA). There are three main takeaways from this investigation. First is that de-identification (the process of removing personal information from a record or data set) is considered to be a use under PHIPA. PHIPA defines the term “use” as meaning to “view, handle, or otherwise deal” with personal health information. Moreover, the use of personal health information for the purpose of de-identification is permitted without the consent of the individual, subject to certain conditions that must be met. This includes the requirement for health information custodians, who have custody and control of personal health information, to be transparent with the public about their information practices by describing them in a written public notice. This brings us to the decision’s second key finding. If custodians are planning to de-identify and sell the de-identified data to a third party for a number of purposes, including for health-related research, they must clearly and explicitly reflect this in their public notice. Patients must be aware of what is being done with their health data, and why, in order for custodians to be held accountable for their actions under PHIPA. The third key takeaway touches on a custodian’s security obligations. PHIPA requires custodians to take reasonable steps to ensure the personal health information they hold is protected and kept secure, including during the process of de-identifying it. Moreover, any sale agreement between a health information custodian and third party must include additional privacy and security controls to ensure the de-identified data remains just that, de-identified. Ultimately, de-identification must be of the highest standard to ensure data cannot be re-identified and the privacy of individuals is protected. A robust de-identification governance process should include ongoing and regular re-identification risk assessments. I urge custodians and public institutions to consult our De-identification Guidelines for Structured Data. These award-winning guidelines introduce the basic concepts and techniques of de-identification and key issues to consider when de-identifying personal information. Interestingly, there are a number of parallels between the main findings of PHIPA Decision 175 and some of the recommendations made by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics (ETHI) in its recent report concerning the federal government’s collection and use of de-identified mobility data obtained from private sector companies during the pandemic. Among its recommendations, the ETHI committee urges the federal government to be transparent and inform Canadians on an ongoing basis of mobility data collection programs by explicitly outlining the nature and purpose of the program. Similarly, we underscored in PHIPA Decision 175 that custodians must be transparent by clearly and explicitly reflecting the purposes of de-identifying personal health information and its intended destiny in their written public statement. The ETHI report also recommends prohibiting the re-identification of de-identified data and introducing a corresponding penalty for doing so. This is something that PHIPA has already done since 2019 by not permitting the re-identification of de-identified information (subject to certain exceptions) and making it an explicit offence for anyone who willfully re-identifies data in contravention of PHIPA. Finally, the ETHI report ushers in a number of recommendations for federal privacy law reform to address the risks inherent with the collection, use, and disclosure of de-identified data. Here in Ontario, the government amended PHIPA in 2020 to allow for the eventual development of regulations under PHIPA that would more explicitly define the expectations around the process and standards for de-identifying data.

Ontario, Canada’s academic and R&D capacity, paired with its collaborative tech ecosystem, attracted the tech company to Waterloo for expansion Since the advent of the internet, Constant Contact has been delivering the tools for businesses to connect with their customers meaningfully. For over 25 years, Constant Contact’s platform has been a leader in email marketing—allowing users to create professional-grade campaigns, grow their customer bases and track their analytics—while expanding to other offerings, such as SMS and social media tools, on its way to becoming a full-service digital marketing platform. Its abundance of features has allowed small businesses and non-profit organizations to have a competitive edge in the market and easily grow their audiences. Last fall, Constant Contact established its first Canadian office in the Kitchener-Waterloo region in collaboration with Waterloo EDC. Its new innovation lab is located at the Communitech Hub in downtown Kitchener, with a goal to conduct research and development in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Constant Contact was founded in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1995, with an aim to enable smaller businesses to compete against larger companies. Since then, the company has helped millions of small businesses achieve that goal. Frank Vella, Constant Contact CEO, says their objective since the early years has remained much of the same: “We exist to help the small stand tall, and we do that by delivering marketing solutions and world-class technology to help them attract the right people to their businesses, engage their customers and grow.” Throughout its history, Constant Contact has been set apart from its competitors in many ways, but chief among them is their reliability. Businesses can depend on their marketing emails, avoiding spam filters and reaching their customers on time. “Our customers need to have confidence that their messages will be delivered as soon as they click ‘send,’ and with a best-in-class deliverability rate of about 97%, Constant Contact helps ensure that happens,” says Vella. Vella also credits Constant Contact’s support team as a major appeal to customers, who can reach an actual human whenever they need assistance. “Whether it’s troubleshooting a quirk or getting advice about a specific industry, we have experts ready to assist—and unlike many other companies in our space, our support team is available to every customer free of charge.” But they aren’t avoiding automation where it counts: artificial intelligence has become a competitive feature on their platform. Earlier this spring, they launched their first AI content generator, allowing customers to write and design professional marketing emails and SMS messages at a keystroke. As one of the leading tech hotspots in North America, the Waterloo region was an obvious choice for the Constant Contact team, who were hoping to recruit from the area’s flourishing student population. And sure enough, they have found a wealth of talent in the region since their expansion: “I can confidently say that the technical talent we’ve seen from Waterloo University students is on par with, and often surpasses, the talent we find in other tech hubs,” says Vella. “Every candidate we have selected from the Waterloo-Kitchener area has exceeded our expectations, whether in front or back-end development or in management roles.” In the long term, Vella wants to further integrate AI and marketing automation into their platform, making it faster and more intuitive for their customers. He sees Waterloo and Toronto as key to their future success as they continue to hire engineers, developers and other professionals in the region to help reach those goals.

Quantum computing leader Xanadu is drawing big international automakers to collaborate within the province on electric battery innovation In a partnership that has caught global attention in the auto industry, Volkswagen Group recently announced it is teaming up with Toronto quantum computing company Xanadu to advance battery technology for electric vehicles. Specifically, the two companies will develop resource-efficient quantum algorithms to accelerate Volkswagen’s adoption of quantum computers, aiming to reduce computational costs and develop battery materials that are safer, lighter and more cost-effective. The news follows Volkswagen’s (VW) launch of a new auto strategy that will see the German multinational transform itself into a software-driven mobility company—with the goal of manufacturing only battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) by 2040. Given that VW’s total BEV sales were just 6% in 2021, there’s work to be done. Critical to success will be developing battery materials that are safer, lighter and more cost-effective—which is where Xanadu comes in. VW is not the only auto manufacturer eager to work with Xanadu. BMW is also working with the company—and, while founder and CEO Christian Weedbrook won’t name names, he does confirm he’s in talks with other car companies. In just six years, Xanadu has set itself apart from competitors like Google, IBM and Intel with a unique photonic approach, which it believes will enable it to become the first company to build quantum computers that are useful and available to people everywhere. On the strength of its innovative science and track record, Xanadu has raised US$200 million in the past eighteen months in two financing rounds from investors that include Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Ontario-based Georgian, as well as BDC Capital, Bessemer Ventures Partners, Forward Ventures, Pegasus Tech Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank. “That kind of continued support from top-tier investors in an uncertain economic climate is a testament to their belief in our photonic technology, our exceptional team and our ability to execute,” says Weedbrook. “Our partnership with Xanadu is a great example of Volkswagen’s commitment to leveraging innovative technologies like quantum computing to accelerate towards 100% electric mobility solutions, optimizing our processes wherever possible,” said Dr. Arne-Christian Voigt, Future Research, Volkswagen AG. “We are excited to push the boundaries of material simulation and build on top of the foundational research we have done so far with Xanadu’s quantum algorithms team.” Plugging into Ontario’s ecosystem With electric vehicles unquestionably the way of the future, more and more automakers are turning to Ontario—and forward-thinking companies like Xanadu—to help give them an all-important competitive edge. That’s because Ontario has an established and respected auto industry that’s been positioning itself as an EV powerhouse for some time. Ontario also has an end-to-end ethical supply chain and a plentiful supply of minerals crucial to EV battery production, such as graphite, lithium, nickel and cobalt. Ontario government focused on building the cars of tomorrow Ontario’s auto industry has the support of the government to make the province a leader in EV development and production. This support includes the well-funded Ontario Innovation Network (OVIN), which is single-mindedly focused on driving innovation and investment in Ontario’s electric, connected and autonomous vehicle sector. Canadian government signs MOUs with Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz In a sign that Canada is quickly becoming a global green supplier of choice for EV battery and vehicle production, both Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz recently signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with the Canadian government to promote electric mobility while enhancing collaboration among the parties. If you’re involved in any aspect of electric vehicle development or production, and you’re not already working here with us, you probably should be.

The pandemic changed many things about our lives, but one of the biggest transformations is in the way that we shop. Instead of walking into a store and browsing before buying something, many of us now lean on eCommerce sites like Amazon and even order our groceries online. According to Statistics Canada, 82% of Canadians shopped online in 2021 compared to 73% in 2018. But for the one million Canadians who are unbanked (don’t have a bank account), and another million or two that are underbanked (do not have access to a wide range of convenient or everyday banking services), shopping online can be tricky if not impossible. As consumers move online, they are still most commonly being faced with a credit card payment option. Fortunately, Payment Source has been able to help with its innovative payment solutions focused on financial inclusion to ensure Canadians can pay using their preferred payment method. Payment Source believes there is a better way to pay, and be paid, for everyday things in our lives. “There’s a social good element that motivates us and drives us,” says CEO Rob Hyde. The Toronto-based company is part of a growing crop of more than 750 fintech companies in Ontario—the largest cluster on the continent behind New York—revolutionizing how we spend money. And Hyde says the company wouldn’t have been so successful without being based in a city like Toronto.  Toronto, a part of Ontario’s innovation corridor, is North America’s fastest-growing tech market, and was recently touted for the biggest “brain gain” in the 2022 CBRE Tech Talent Report. “You’ve got both tech talent in Ontario, and you’ve got financial knowledge with all the big banks in Toronto, so it becomes an incubator for ideas,” he said. Toronto, a part of Ontario’s innovation corridor, is North America’s fastest-growing tech market, and was recently touted for the biggest “brain gain” in the 2022 CBRE Scoring Tech Talent report. A lifeline for underbanked Canadians Payment Source has managed to be a force for good, allowing the eight percent of Canadians who don’t have a credit card for privacy, debt or personal reasons to make purchases online. “We’re not saying you should never use credit—we offer that in some of our solutions as well,” Hyde said. “But we are saying that people shouldn’t be forced to pick one payment method because that organization or that group has just decided that’s the only way that they can do it.” But Payment Source’s cards aren’t just for people without credit cards or bank accounts—they’re also for anyone hoping to manage their spending and stay out of debt. “I can give a card like this to my kids and not worry that I am going to give them blank carte blanche on my credit limit,” Hyde says. As one of 148 Ontario delegates at this year’s Collision conference, Payment Source is a key player Toronto’s bustling tech scene. Toronto’s environment of cooperative support and competitive motivation has helped push Payment Source to develop its innovative fintech solutions: “There’s a large ‘cooperation’ environment here that really helps advance new ideas and create new value,” Hyde said. For Hyde, being based in Ontario has helped the company grow to the heights it has because it contains so many great fintech companies and collaborative associations who understand that competitiveness isn’t the only thing that breeds innovation—it’s also cooperation.

It’s a really exciting time to be in health care, particularly here in Ontario, where we’re driving digital transformation with the goal of improving people’s lives. The province’s innovation ecosystem is the perfect habitat for the biotech giant’s AI centre of excellence Roche is the world’s largest biotechnology company with operations in 100 countries. But when Roche Canada colleagues saw the opportunity to establish a centre of excellence (CoE) for artificial intelligence, they knew the best home would be in Canada—exploring the idea from Roche’s Mississauga, Ontario pharmaceutical headquarters. Why? Because the country is home to a small group of elite scientists who are mapping the future of AI, and Ontario has a robust AI ecosystem primed for innovation. “Long before anyone really understood the potential of AI, University of Toronto emeritus professor Geoffrey Hinton was pioneering the science here in Ontario,” explains Fanny Sie, who heads Roche’s new AI CoE, which launched in November 2020. Thirty-plus years ago, Hinton was focused on making it possible for computers to learn. Back then, the idea was revolutionary. But the federal government was prepared to fund Hinton’s research, and it attracted the best and brightest scientific minds from Ontario and abroad. As Hinton’s AI breakthroughs moved from the lab in Toronto to real-world applications, an innovation ecosystem—including corporate R&D centres and venture capital firms—grew up in the surrounding region. Today, Ontario is recognized worldwide as a leader in the field. Roche’s virtual AI CoE will tap into that exceptional AI expertise. Now collaborating closely with Toronto’s Vector Institute, Roche’s AI CoE, together with the formidable talent at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) and the Quebec AI Institute (Mila) as part of CIFAR’s Pan-Canadian AI Strategy, is driving digital transformation in health. Sie was chosen to lead the Roche initiative because of her background in research and innovation—and her belief that collaboration spurs discovery. She’s excited about the potential for AI in general—and the CoE in particular—to improve and save people’s lives. And she’s driven to see rapid results. “AI helps to make decisions quickly,” she explains. “There’s so much information out there, in so many different formats, we can’t possibly go through it all manually. That’s where artificial intelligence and machine learning come in. We can use the power of computers to collect, sort and analyze data and make sense of it in a fraction of the time it would take humans.” A timely case in point: When COVID-19 hit around the world, Roche Canada assembled the Data Science Coalition—a group of public and private organizations dedicated to working with the global community to bring actionable COVID-19 solutions to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains and governments worldwide. “Everyone in the Roche COVID-19 coalition has a superpower, and everyone recognized that this was a common challenge that couldn’t be solved without the others.” Since its creation in April 2020, the coalition has been using AI to develop a comprehensive overview of what’s happening in different parts of the world. The AI then translates the results to be immediately useful to individual governments, health agencies and scientists. To date, the coalition’s work has contributed to over 100 digital solutions and insights into COVID-19. The first major undertaking of Roche’s AI CoE is the End ALS Challenge, an open data competition that connects the global AI and neuroscience communities. The goal is to improve healthcare professionals’ understanding of the overall biology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and improve diagnosis and drug discovery. It’s the largest and most comprehensive ALS research project in history, producing more combined ALS clinical and biological data than has ever been amassed and openly sharing it with the global research community. ALS is a devastating disease. The AI CoE and its research collaborators are eager to see what data-driven insights the End ALS Challenge produces using AI and machine learning—and what applications there might be for other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s and Multiple Sclerosis. Says Sie, “It’s a really exciting time to be in health care, particularly here in Ontario, where we’re driving digital transformation with the goal of improving people’s lives.”

Canada ranks second in Kearney’s annual Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Confidence Index for 2021, a jump from ranking third in 2019. Although business leaders are relatively less confident about the outlook for the global economy in the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, they remain highly optimistic towards Canada’s economic prospects, proving Canada’s unrelenting strength in today’s global economy. The 2021 Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence report compiles data on global markets, investors’ focus and top-of-mind governance and market asset factors that impact FDI inflows for the top 25 countries according to FDI intentions. Canada remains promising for investors This year, only 57% of investors reported that they are optimistic for the three-year outlook for the global economy—a significant decline from 72% reported before the onset of the pandemic. Despite this, Canada remains a top-three country in the FDI Confidence Index, and investment interest in Canada remains steady. Canada’s advanced economy and political stability continue to encourage new investment from abroad. Investors are optimistic about Canada’s developed markets According to the report, investors focus on the governance and regulatory climate, as well as market assets and infrastructure, when considering a country in which to invest. Due to the pandemic, investors are placing a heavier emphasis on market assets and infrastructure. Research and development (R&D) capabilities break into the top five factors, a significant leap from ranking thirteenth in 2019. Investors continue to prioritize governance and regulations and increase their interest in market assets and infrastructure. Canada remains a promising FDI option due to its high governance and technology scores as well as its low risk of commodity price increases, geopolitical tensions and economic crisis in an emerging market. Investors remain bullish on Canada’s economy Nearly one-third of investors are more confident and optimistic about Canada’s economy this year, leading to a confidence score of 2.10, which is the second-highest rating among the 25 countries ranked by the index. In fact, investors reported greater net confidence for Canada than the United States. The post-pandemic global economy Despite the global economic and financial setbacks from the pandemic, investors continue to trust that FDI will drive corporate profitability and competitiveness in the next three years. Given this continued trust from investors, the FDI Confidence Index remains an accurate predictor of a country’s economic prospects, and Canada’s high ranking reflects the continuation of international investments in the country.

When COVID-19 arrived on Japan’s shores via the Diamond Princess cruise ship about a year ago, the tension brewing around me at the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo was familiar. I was also working at the Embassy almost 10 years ago during the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, and just like then, I could feel that our lives were about to be turned upside down, for a while at least. In 2011, at the outset, most of us shifted our work to focus on the initial crisis response, including by helping Canadians in Japan in need. As was the case 10 years ago, we then wiped the board clean, cancelled our previously planned initiatives and soon after started to adapt our business plans to the changed realities on the ground. Ontario's Representative in Japan, David Perdue As the head of Ontario’s Trade and Investment Office located in the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, I am now leading a small team that focuses on promoting trade, investment and science and technology linkages between Ontario and Japan. Japan has long seen Ontario as a good place to invest and as a quality source of imports. That said, achieving success here is rarely straightforward, not least because of the cultural and language differences, but also because of the importance of developing relationships through face-to-face contact despite the long travel times, and the time-consuming process of building of consensus before deals are done. I thought that in the absence of business travel in both directions and the related loss of face-to-face contact due to COVID-related restrictions, our work would fundamentally suffer. In many ways, the pandemic has made our work more difficult, but it has also accelerated some positive trends and changes that were starting to gain momentum before the global crisis. From my perspective, the most important of these changes, and the one that may offer the most opportunity for Ontario, is the change in the way that Japan is approaching innovation. It is well known that Japan is a hub for innovation. Whether it is how we listen to music at home or on the go, record our memories through photos and videos, drive and navigate our cars or even use the washroom (I am thinking of those miraculous toilets), Japan’s innovations have changed countless people’s lives across continents and generations. When I was here 10 years ago, Japan’s mega-companies were almost exclusively using a “closed” model of innovation that relied on in-house teams of engineers or programmers to create new ideas and technologies, which they then incorporated in products sold under their brands to consumers around the world. Japanese companies also used mostly fixed supply chains consisting of trusted domestic partners even in overseas locations, which meant in many cases that it was next to impossible to get our foot in the door. However, what has started to change Japan’s innovation dynamic is that disruptive technologies, like artificial intelligence and the connectedness of everything and everyone, have meant that almost no company, no matter how large or insular, can stay competitive in the long term without taking a more “open” approach. Even conservative Japanese companies have come to recognize this. What this means is that Japanese firms are becoming more open to collaborating with innovative foreign companies large and small and investing overseas to benefit from innovation-driven ecosystems. While places like California and Israel have been the focus of initial attention, there has been increasing awareness of what Ontario has to offer. The province is known for having an innovation ecosystem that is just as dynamic as our most famous competitors, but with lower costs and other distinct advantages—from easy access to skilled and diverse talent to quality of life and more. Despite COVID-19, or maybe in part because of it, we have noticed that the demand from the Japanese business community to connect with Ontario’s start-up and innovation ecosystems is now higher than ever.

Welcome to Invest in Ontario’s inaugural regional spotlight. Ontario has an array of incredibly diverse municipalities spread across its vast geographical landscape. Each month we will post a feature highlighting a unique region and what makes it special from both a business and lifestyle standpoint. What’s more, it will be in their own words. Here’s what North Bay, Ontario had to say about its wonderful city: The perfect balance for business growth and quality lifestyle Even during a pandemic, the City of North Bay is making headlines and earning a reputation as a place for businesses and families to call home. In September alone, North Bay was featured as one of Ontario’s most affordable real estate markets and by another publication as among Canada’s top 20 business environments. We would like to think that this kind of attention hasn’t happened by accident. Throughout the pandemic, we’ve continued to make economic development a priority, recognizing that attracting new investment and assisting our existing businesses during this time is more important than ever. While there’s no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted businesses in North Bay and around the world, it has also underscored the importance of lifestyle and the need to work safely and productively from anywhere, making our city that much more appealing. “People are able to work remotely in a place that’s not only more affordable and offers more space, but has all of the amenities of a larger centre – everything from public transit and recreational facilities to a performing arts centre and ski hill,” says Mayor Al McDonald. With this in mind, we have retooled some of our economic development initiatives, including an intensified business retention and expansion program and recently launched package of incentives offered through a Growth Community Improvement Plan. We will be using these programs and others to build on recent successes such as the construction of Norgalv Limited, a new galvanizing plant at our Airport Industrial Business Park. After an extensive search, Norgalv chose North Bay as the site of their new $21-million facility, and now calls the city home. “As a group of investors from South Africa, we investigated various business opportunities across the globe ranging from Europe to Australia, but ultimately decided on North Bay,” said Andre van Soelen, Managing Director of Norgalv Limited. “I can honestly say that the decision was made easy due to the hard work, drive and assistance from all levels of government. It is absolutely amazing that Canada and North Bay have welcomed us with open arms.” Our efforts to attract new residents and businesses will be coupled with the Federal Government’s soon-to-be-launched Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot; and, in partnership with the province, we will continue to focus on assisting local businesses and sectors in recovering from the COVID-19 shutdown. North Bay marked its second highest construction year on record in 2019 and celebrated a record year for film and television activity – and we want to keep the momentum going. “We look forward to once again reaching similar milestones,” says Mayor McDonald. “It is our priority to create new job opportunities, not only to attract new residents, but to enable more residents to stay in North Bay and make it their home.”

Farnborough International Airshow (FIA) is moving to the web instead of taking to the skies this year, and Ontario companies are along for the ride. Attended by over 80,000 participants from across the globe, FIA is one of the world’s leading aerospace and defence shows. This year, due to COVID-19, FIA is now FIA Connect, a free online-only event described as “five days of high quality content, collaboration, thought leadership and industry insight.” Ontario has a long history of attending FIA due in no small part to our reputation for excellence in the fields of aerospace and defence. Held bi-annually in England (and alternating each year with their partner event, the Paris Airshow), FIA 2018 was attended by just a handful of Ontario companies. FIA Connect gives more firms an opportunity to join in, so this year Ontario is pleased to be bringing over 30 innovative aerospace and defence companies to FIA Connect’s online showcase. Home to Trusted Suppliers Did you know that made-in-Ontario parts are aboard nearly every passenger aircraft in the world? With over 200 dedicated aerospace firms and $6 billion in annual sales, it’s not difficult to believe. From aeronautical systems to landing gear, there is an Ontario company for practically every part of a plane. International companies have set up shop in Ontario too, creating and benefiting from an integrated and diversified supply chain with far-reaching global connections. Big names that have found a home in Ontario include Airbus, Bombardier, Precision Castparts Corp., Honeywell, Raytheon Technologies, L3 Harris, Leonardo, Safran, De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and MDA. Where Innovation Soars Ontario is much more than parts and OEMs. The province’s robust innovation ecosystem – comprising world class research institutes, innovation labs and universities and colleges – drive breakthroughs every day in AI, robotics, precision manufacturing and advanced engineering. With over $500 million spent on research and development here annually, Ontario is leading the way to the future of aerospace and defence. Ontario is home to tech hubs like the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, The Perimeter Institute for Quantum Technology, MaRS, Communitech, and the Creative Destruction Lab. Attracting the brightest talent from across the globe, these facilities are fostering new thinking and advanced ideas that take the power of innovation out of the lab and into the skies.

Oakville, Ontario, based Shoplogix was founded in 2002 on the premise that better information could lead to improved outcomes in the manufacturing sector. 18 years later, Shoplogix is one of Ontario’s leading Industry 4.0 companies, helping global Fortune 1000 manufacturing companies to visualize, integrate and act upon production performance in real-time to uncover hidden potential on the shop floor. With international offices across Latin America and Europe and with customers across 32 countries, Shoplogix is a global player. Their customers are major players in the automotive, food & beverage, consumer packaged goods, industrial packaging and steel services industrial sectors. The ROI of Industry 4.0 Shoplogix transforms the way manufacturers see data by connecting machine data with people, processes and assets, allowing manufacturers to find opportunities to reduce operating costs and increase profitability. And along the way, they’ve also learned that by putting ‘real-time’ productivity displays on shop floors for operators to see and track their performance makes a significant impact on productivity. “When we first put Shoplogix on the floor, one of the things we noticed right away was that the employees took great interest,” says Dan Vinson, Operations Manager at IAC and customer of Shoplogix. “We actually saw an immediate impact even before a single insight was shared through the platform. Downtimes dropped and breaks shortened. It gave our people on the floor some skin in the game.” By connecting Shoplogix to IAC’s machines, they were able to monitor and track machine downtime details in order to pinpoint areas of improvement, helping them achieve an 11% increase in ‘uptime’ and thereby realizing a savings of $30,000 within the first month of using Shoplogix. Other customers report similar increases in productivity: Fareva SA, a contract manufacturing company, attributes Shoplogix to a 13% decrease in setup time and a 14% decline in downtime. The savings add up to better ROI. Leveraging Ontario’s talent to fuel future growth Shoplogix’s Magnus Sandberg, President and CEO, cites their location within Ontario’s tech corridor as a big part of their success. “Ontario’s technology sector is leading the way when it comes to IIoT development... [and] there are many advantages of operating in North America’s fastest-growing tech market. One of them is that [Ontario is] a hub for highly skilled IIoT developers and innovators. We have had great luck hiring local talent. It really is the people that continue to propel our product forward.” The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to grow substantially in the next few years: Global spending on IIoT platforms for manufacturing is set to grow to $12.44B in 2024, with manufacturing accounting for the largest market for IIoT platforms with an expected value of $438 million by 2021. Shoplogix will be ready, with plans to leverage AI to tackle new challenges as they emerge. They recently acquired Ontario-based ERP software company, IndustriOS, to significantly benefit their customers across operations by providing a one-stop-shop for all smart manufacturing software applications. “Being strategically located close to the talent pool that drives our business’ success, we’re well-equipped to help companies make their smart factories even smarter.”

Ryerson University’s Fashion Zone fosters growth in multiple sectors through its startup support The word “Fashion” might evoke images of clothing, shoes and accessories for some, but Andrea Romero, manager at Ryerson University’s Fashion Zone, explains why it’s so much more: “Fashion is everything you touch. The design process is alive in all kinds of products, including furniture and even cellphones.” Located in the heart of downtown Toronto, the Fashion Zone has been inspiring design innovation since 2013. This incubator has member companies with products across the fashion spectrum, and throughout the product, service and technology sectors. It is part of Ryerson University’s approach to experiential learning – providing members with mentorship opportunities from over 40 industry professionals, and access to a network of 160 companies within the Fashion Zone “family.” “We have a community of like-minded entrepreneurs who help each other,” says Romero. Members are instructed in the skills necessary to launch a company, and given 24/7 access to a workspace equipped with prototyping tools. And as an additional perk, members have access to the University’s student talent pool through the Fashion Zone’s Associate and Apprentice program. Beyond the Runway The Fashion Zone provides special programming, specific to its unique group of entrepreneurs, including branding/storytelling, growth marketing, retail operations and sustainable design. “You can’t sell a product without a good brand story because customers will question the legitimacy of the company,” explains Romero. However, no matter how innovative or unique the brand, companies can run into trouble quickly if their strategies aren’t yielding growth. A reality, all too true in fashion – an industry where funding cycles move faster than they do for even technology or software companies. That’s why Romero believes Fashion Zone’s biggest value to students comes from identifying the most commercial piece in their collection, by looking at the production costs and processes. “We think beyond the runway show,” says Romero. “The show may create buzz, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t always convert to a sale.” The “Alumni” Label With a 31 per cent increase in applications over the last year, Ontario fashion start-ups clearly recognize the value the Fashion Zone holds for their companies’ future. When selecting members, Fashion Zone looks for candidates who are coachable, driven and passionate about what they do. Many of these applicants go on to become successful alumni, including Inkbox, Knixwear, Soxy, 2020 Armor and Encircled. By maintaining relationships with its alumni, the Fashion Zone broadens its network for past, current and future attendees – keeping alumni as an integral part of the incubator’s collaborative environment. “If we can’t answer a member’s question, we connect them with an alumni who can.” It’s advantageous for the alumni as well, as the incubator and the university’s talent pool is an added benefit for start-ups. “Toronto is a top destination for tech talent, and we have design talent from Ryerson University – the top fashion school in Canada,” says Romero. “Access to diverse talent in a world-class city is key for us.” Fueled by Technology Last year, the Fashion Zone graduated 18 companies, while the revenue from companies currently in the accelerator experienced a 69 per cent increase. Poised for growth, the Fashion Zone moved into a new building on Ryerson’s campus, shared with both the Design and Fabrication Zone and the Trans-Media Zone. The Design and Fabrication Zone will prove to be a handy neighbour as the accelerator focuses on interior design, architecture and the making process. The Trans-Media Zone specializes in radio, television and broadcasting, which ties in nicely as influencers and virtual reality technology are becoming a large part of fashion. The Fashion Zone also has its eye on new global partnerships. “Ryerson University has ties all around the world and we are always looking forward to our next collaborator,” says Romero. “Internationalization is top of mind for us.” In the future, the incubator aims to keep more fashion companies in Canada, and increase their ability to scale up in Ontario. While traditional fashion markets are larger abroad, Ontario companies exploring the worlds of jewelry, cell phones and tattoos – to name a few – find a foundation in Canada that allows these companies to succeed.

Imagine a future where you can walk into a hotel, train station or tourism centre and a virtual concierge provides you with personalized, local recommendations based on how you’re feeling in real time. That future exists now. Chillwall’s deep learning AI provides a human-like visitor discovery experience based on a user’s location, interests and mood, connecting people from their digital interface to the real world. Chillwall AI is a data intelligence firm located in Toronto. Its founders Michael Campanelli MBA and Dr. Ian Knowles have developed remarkable machine learning algorithms to power Chillwall AI’s artificial intelligence platform. Their proprietary AI, named BETTY, learns from numeric and linguistic data; to find patterns and identify personalized opportunities. Our AI platform knows what each person wants before they realize they want it.Dr. Ian Knowles Discovery My Way, Chillwall AI’s new disruptive Virtual Concierge enables personal discovery by how the user feels. “Growth will be focused around creating a transformational visitor experience for hotels and tourism, increasing revenue spend followed by retail,” says Michael Campanelli. This service takes the form of a concierge widget that can be embedded into any digital platform, including a business’s website with only a couple of lines of code. We have focused on the part of the personality that drives curiosity, and on converting that curiosity into desire to go experience and enjoy. The service has the potential to revolutionize the way people search for unique local experiences such as festivals, cooking classes or new restaurants, which is conventionally done by scrolling through endless lists of blog posts or event calendars in the hope of finding one that seems interesting. The founders at Chillwall AI understand that the majority of experience-based purchases are carried out on an emotional level, so they have designed their concierge to discover and interact with users. From there, BETTY’s deep learning capabilities develop an understanding of the visitor’s interests and passions just as a human concierge would, in order to recommend experiences tailored to how they feel. Michael Campanelli describes this process as “discovery without search” and the way forward for experience-based discovery platforms. The Experience Economy Chillwall’s AI innovation fits in seamlessly with the shift towards an experience-oriented economy. According to a study conducted by Expedia and the Center for Generational Kinetics, a staggering 74 per cent of Americans now prioritize experiences over products or things. Spending money on travel, concerts, and other tourist related activities brings more lasting joy and fulfillment than spending money on material possessions. Experiences are also easier to share with friends over social media, which is important to younger generations. For example, it is more engaging to share pictures and stories from a hike or cooking class than it is to show pictures of a newly purchased TV. Chillwall’s founders are looking towards the shifting consumer landscape and aligning their business model with this new trillion-dollar experience-focused market. Chillwall’s ability to meet the needs of this new consumer economy is made possible through their proprietary AI, which allows them to “process millions of calculations very quickly through light data models.” Chillwall acknowledges the support they’ve received from various accelerators as well as the Ontario government. The company is a graduate of the World’s Top 5 Accelerator: University of Waterloo linked AC Accelerator. “There is tremendous support from the Ontario government, which means that you can get your business launched and supported by experts,” states Campanelli. Predictive AI scaled down to a personal level will have a disruptive effect on the way we interact with our living spaces and bring about a new era of augmented reality. In the case of Chillwall AI this means “a better visitor experience, more visitors, longer stays, and for the very first-time, real insights into how people feel when they’re discovering their cities.”

Toronto rises to 3rd in the CBRE’s 2019 Scoring Tech Talent report based on strong job growth and low costs. Ottawa placed 19th, while Hamilton and Waterloo rank among North America’s top three up-and-coming tech markets. Toronto is the fastest growing tech market in North America. With 80,100 tech jobs created, Toronto’s tech job growth was greater than the job growth in New York City,Seattle, and Boston combined. This comes from the CBRE’s 2019 Scoring Tech Talent report, which ranked Toronto as the third strongest tech market overall, rising the ranks from last year to surpass Washington, DC. Ottawa also scored on the ranking, placing 19th. Toronto, San Francisco and Seattle… are attracting the best in the industry “We hear about tech more and more, but in a thriving city like Toronto, the impact of tech companies and the growing influence of tech talent cannot be overstated. Tech job growth has a multiplier effect in the economy,” says CBRE Canada Vice Chairman Paul Morassutti. “Toronto, San Francisco and Seattle are comfortably mentioned in the same sentence and are attracting the best in the industry.” According to the report, Toronto also offers high quality talent for a fraction of the cost. Comparable tech talent in Toronto costs less than half that of San Francisco and about 50% less than either New York or Seattle. Toronto had the third lowest cost of doing business overall, and both Toronto and Ottawa are in fact more inexpensive to do business in than any American city listed. This is due to large savings on both office rents and talent costs. Toronto leads the ‘brain gain’ While some cities on the list did not produce enough jobs for all their graduates, Toronto created over 57,000 more jobs than graduates over the previous five years, making it the number one “brain gain” destination in North America. Ottawa ranked as having the second highest tech employment concentration. 9.9% of Ottawa’s workforce is employed in the tech sector, only 0.1% behind San Francisco, while Toronto ranked third. Hamilton and the Waterloo Region were also identified as two of the fastest growing opportunity markets. Hamilton’s tech employment grew by 52% over the past five years while Waterloo’s grew by 40%. “Opportunity markets offer quality labour pools and affordability that supports rapid scalability,” Morassutti said. “These markets can be ideal for small-scale operations, startups and tech jobs with non-tech employers like banks, media and services firms.”

ELECTRIFYING THE REGION: HOW THE TORONTO REGION CREATES END-TO-END EV INNOVATION The Toronto Region is not only electric in atmosphere, but transportation as well. Canada as a whole is diving headfirst into building more sustainable transportation methods for the good of the planet and the Toronto Region is leading the way by investing in a robust electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. Canada’s energy is 82.5 percent emission-free, double that of the United States and 20 points better than the European Union. However, transportation still accounts for 25 percent of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions. Ontario’s proportion of CO2 emissions generated from electricity has declined from 17 percent to 2 percent in a 15-year period, and the province is taking steps to continue this momentum. As part of the federal 2023 budget, The Government of Canada unveiled a $120 billion clean economy plan. At the centre of it all is the Toronto Region. EV companies in the Toronto Region leverage an end-to-end EV supply chain to easily source talent, materials, and facilities to create an electric vehicle. What the Toronto Region lacks in quantity of minerals, we make up for in high-tech research and development facilities, an abundance of skilled talent, and a strong supply chain connecting companies to manufacturing facilities across the country. With the recent announcement from the Government of Ontario that strengthens the trade relationship between Ontario and Michigan, the Toronto Region continues to grow its ties with major EV manufacturing hubs across Canada and internationally. You could build an electric bus from beginning to end right here in the Toronto Region. The quality and size of manufacturers in the Toronto Region is another major contributor to the strength of the industry. EV companies in the Toronto Region have access to a community of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that choose to stay due to the high volume of EV companies, as well as government incentives. Each OEM’s presence creates a snowball effect that only builds a stronger EV sector for companies in the Toronto Region. MAGNA: Magna International recently expanded its Brampton, Ontario facility. This expansion includes a new 490,000 square-foot facility to manufacture battery enclosures for electric vehicles in Brampton, supporting the Ford F-150 Lightning and other future OEM programs. Ford’s presence in the Toronto Region was a key factor in Magna’s expansion. TESLA: Autonomous vehicles are the future of electric mobility and Tesla’s automation manufacturing facility in Markham, Ontario is making the Toronto Region a major player in this fast-growing field. “Tesla Toronto Automation” has scaled up production of machinery for battery cell production by expanding their facility to 110,000 square-feet. STELLANTIS: The world-leading automotive manufacturing corporation, Stellantis, invested $3.4B in its Brampton and Windsor plants to increase EV production. Stellantis’ Brampton plant is recognized globally, having received the World Class Manufacturing award. Additionally, Stellantis’ Windsor branch creates an easy and quick supply chain solution to one of Northern Ontario’s mineral hubs. NOVA BUS AND NEW FLYER: The electrification of public transportation is top of mind in the Toronto Region and Canadian corporations Nova Bus and New Flyer are helping us get there. The City of Toronto is set to shift to all zero-emission Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) vehicle procurement by 2025 and to have a 100 percent zero-emission fleet by 2040. The TTC operates one of the largest electric bus fleets in North America and the electrification of this fleet will make a sizeable dent in the country’s overall emissions. The Government of Canada supports this mission by allocating $140M in funding toward the procurement of electric buses and building infrastructure for EV charging. Nova Bus is located in Montreal, Quebec and New Flyer in Winnipeg, Manitoba – demonstrating the strong interprovincial supply chain operating within the Toronto Region.

A LARGE TALENT POOL: Toronto boasts the third-largest tech talent pool in North America, ranking just behind the San Francisco Bay Area and New York Metro. The city has become a magnet for skilled, high-quality tech workers. Particularly, the occupation ‘Software Developers and Programmers’ experienced remarkable growth, rising by 58.3 percent from 2017 to 2022. This surge in talent showcases Toronto's appeal as a tech hub, attracting developers and programmers from all over the world. It is important to note that Toronto’s tech talent pool dipped slightly in 2022 to 285,700 tech workers, compared to 289,700 workers in 2021. The dip in employment is partially due to the economic uncertainty faced in 2022, coupled with tech layoffs and flexible work structures that allow tech professionals to work from anywhere. Although there was a decrease in tech employment in 2022, the city maintains its position as the third-largest tech talent workforce in North America. With Canada’s friendly immigration programs, Toronto’s tech workforce will continue to remain strong. A notable characteristic to analyze within tech talent is the diverse, young population. Compared to other large tech markets* in North America, Toronto experienced a significant population growth in the 20s and 30s age groups between 2016 and 2021. Individuals in their 20s grew by 11.1 percent, while those in their 30s grew by 14.7 percent. This growth is among the highest across large tech markets, serving as evidence of the city’s growing tech workforce and innovative potential. As for diversity, Toronto’s tech talent workforce across all industries is made of 68 percent visible minorities, where Asians make up the majority. Women in tech amounted to 27 percent of the workforce, a steadily growing percentage. STRONG TECH TALENT GROWTH Toronto experienced the second-largest tech talent growth in North America between 2017 and 2022, just behind San Francisco Bay Area. During this period, Toronto added 63,800 tech jobs, a growth of 29 percent over the last five years. In fact, Toronto was recognized as the fastest-growing tech talent market in last year’s edition, showcasing the city’s promise in the industry. To sustain the city’s tech talent growth, Toronto is growing its tech talent pipeline. Toronto ranks in the top 10 among its U.S. counterparts for tech degree completions, which grew by 41.7 percent between 2017-2021 – a higher growth than the national average. TECH INDUSTRY DOMINANCE Toronto's tech talent is primarily concentrated in the tech industry itself, followed closely by the FIRE (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) industry. Around 43 percent of the tech talent in Toronto works within the tech industry, while 20 percent is employed within the FIRE industry. The concentrated workforce in the tech industry has fostered a robust innovation ecosystem, supporting Toronto’s rise as a global hub for AI. Moreover, the large share of tech workers within the FIRE industry complements Toronto’s reputation as the nation’s leader in financial services innovation and a top destination for fintech investments. Toronto is the second-largest financial centre in North America, and the largest in Canada. All five of Canada’s largest banks are headquartered in Toronto, as well as many notable fintech companies such as Wealthsimple and Borrowell. TECH 'JOBS' MARKET Toronto has firmly established itself as a thriving tech job market. The city's strong growth in tech talent, coupled with the presence of leading tech companies and a wide range of job opportunities, has created an ideal environment for tech professionals. Toronto was ranked as the top job market, creating 31,405 more tech jobs than graduates. On top of supporting the growth in the city’s tech talent pipeline, Toronto-based companies hire large amounts of tech professionals. Recognizing the potential in Toronto, tech leaders such as Snowflake and Oxbotica have invested in the city’s tech ecosystem by establishing a presence here. To complement Toronto’s tech ecosystem, the Government of Canada has launched a ‘Tech Talent Strategy’, introducing additional immigration programs to support Canada’s status as a leader in global tech talent recruitment and attraction. Among these programs includes a streamlined work permit for H1-B visa holders in the U.S. The program was so successful that it reached its target of 10,000 applicants within just two days – a testament to how attractive Toronto is for jobseekers.

THE RISE OF THE TORONTO REGION AS A GLOBAL AI HUB With the recent expansion of Salt Lake City-based bio tech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals in Downtown Toronto, and Salesforce’s announcement of their $250 million Generative AI fund, AI is top of mind in the Toronto Region. In recent years, Toronto Region has become a global hub for artificial intelligence (AI) due to a combination of factors, including its world-class education system, talented workforce, industry support, and the presence of top AI companies. This has led to a thriving ecosystem of startups, multinational enterprises, and research institutions that are pushing the boundaries of AI innovation. A key factor contributing to the Toronto Region's success in AI is its world-class education system. The region is home to several top-ranked universities, including the University of Toronto, which consistently ranks among the top 10 universities in the world for computer science. These institutions attract top talent from around the world, with a 61 percent increase in international student enrolments over the last five years. Within STEM disciplines, that figure is even higher – 78 percent. One-fifth of immigrants to the Toronto Region have a STEM degree, making it a magnet for global talent. Toronto Region’s talented workforce is also a major contributor to its success in AI. According to CBRE’s annual Tech Talent report, the city boasts the most tech employment growth in North America from 2016-2021, and over 110,000 people immigrate to the Toronto Region each year, twice as many as the San Francisco Bay Area. The presence of AI leaders in the region has played a significant role in the city's rise as a global hub for AI. Many multinational enterprises have chosen Toronto Region as the home for their AI R&D (research and development) centres, such as Samsung, Sanofi, and Nvidia. With nearly 50 percent of Canada’s CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) AI Research Chairs based in Ontario, and the presence of leading AI research institutions such as Vector Institute and the University of Toronto, establishing in the Toronto Region offers companies a strategic advantage. From access to leading AI researchers to partnerships across academia and industry, the possibilities are endless. Toronto’s strong network of incubators and accelerators, such as MaRS and NextAI, have also supported the growth of world-renowned AI companies in the region. Deep Genomics, a leader in AI-powered drug discovery, Radical Ventures, a Venture Capital organization dedicated to investing in AI, and Cohere, a generative AI firm specializing in natural language processing (NLP). The AI ecosystem expands across the region through academic institutions like Durham College’s AI Hub and Vector recognized AI Master’s programs at York University, Ontario Tech University, Toronto Metropolitan University and the University of Toronto. Postsecondary institutions like this breed innovation. For example, a Toronto-based startup  led by a UofT alumni and Co-founder of the Vector Institute called Signal 1 AI Inc, has developed a machine learning tool called CHARTWatch, which analyzes commonly collected hospital data to predict patients’ diagnoses that are likely to deteriorate. Trillium Health Partners in Mississauga has recently adopted this technology to improve patient care and identify when a patient is ready for their next stage of recovery. This will help hospitals establish and prioritize proper patient flow activities. This demonstrates how a supportive ecosystem such as this one, spans far and wide. A solution developed in a specific jurisdiction is not limited to that area and accelerates other players in the entire region and beyond. Industry support and government initiatives have been instrumental in building out Toronto’s AI ecosystem. The Canadian federal government has invested heavily in AI research, with a $125 million investment in the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy, which aims to position Canada as a global leader in AI. Collision Conference brought on the announcement of new AI-focused funding by the Government of Ontario, who have committed $77 million in funding for the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Ontario Centre of Innovation, to support a new Critical Technologies Initiatives program. This funding will help companies in the Toronto Region adopt, develop and bring to market critical technologies, with a focus on Ethical and Responsible AI. These new government and industry support initiatives allow the Toronto Region to stay ahead of the curve and continue to set itself apart as a global leader in AI innovation.

HOW MULTICULTURAL IS THE TORONTO REGION? LET US COUNT THE WAYS... AGAIN Torontonians and 905ers often boast about their multiculturalism, so in 2019, we took it upon ourselves to back up this claim with some facts. Now over four years – and some pretty world-changing events – later, we wanted to take another look at the stats and prove once again that the Toronto Region is home to the most diverse population in the world. Our commitment to multiculturalism is enshrined in the City of Toronto’s official motto: “Diversity, Our Strength.” Observers from renowned chef Anthony Bourdain to Amazon have highlighted the Toronto Region’s unique advantage in having so many people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. BBC Radio even crowned Toronto as the most multicultural city in the world in 2016 after London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan offered up his city for the title. A bold claim, to be sure. New York, London, Sydney, and Los Angeles – not to mention cities like Singapore, Jerusalem, São Paulo and Mumbai with multiple, distinct cultural and ethnic communities – are all exceptionally vibrant, diverse places. But the Toronto Region’s diversity still stands apart in several ways. For one thing, the proportion of Toronto’s foreign-born population remains higher than just about any major city worldwide. In the Toronto Region, half of the population were not born in Canada. This is higher than any other North American metro region and greater than London, Sydney, Melbourne, Paris, and Amsterdam. Compared to other Canadian cities, Toronto consistently ranks far beyond in terms of ethnic diversity – only Vancouver comes close. More than 128,000 new permanent residents came to the City of Toronto in 2022, making up 30 percent of Canada’s newcomer total. Montreal, which welcomed the second-largest number of newcomers, had nearly 53,000 – less than half the number of people who moved to Toronto. Over 250 ethnicities and 190 languages are represented in the Toronto Region - in addition to English and French, the official languages of Canada, one can hear a myriad of languages such as Mandarin, Punjabi, Tagalog, Urdu, Tamil, and many more. Roughly half the population identifies as a visible minority. But the numbers only tell part of the story. Spend some time in the Toronto Region, and you’ll quickly realize that our multiculturalism is woven into every aspect of our way of life, whether it’s our food, art, festivals, or businesses. The Toronto Region is home to numerous neighbourhoods that represent different ethnic communities. From Chinatown, Little Italy, Greektown and Little India in Toronto to communities like Markham and Brampton in the 905, these vibrant enclaves preserve and promote their cultural identities, offering a taste of their respective cuisines, traditions, and languages. Exploring these neighbourhoods provides a glimpse into the multicultural tapestry of the city. These events highlight the city's multicultural heritage and offer residents and visitors a chance to experience a global array of cultures. At these festivals, one can sample an extensive array of international cuisines. From Thai to Ethiopian, Korean to Lebanese, a vast range of dining options cater to diverse tastes and preferences. Multiculturalism is also a driving force in the Toronto Region's business ecosystem. From a diverse workforce and multilingual customer service to international trade and cultural entrepreneurship, businesses in the region actively embrace and leverage the opportunities its multicultural population presents. Companies who expand here view the region’s multiculturalism as an asset, recognizing the value of diverse perspectives, experiences and cultural backgrounds. The Toronto Region's inclusive policies foster a sense of belonging and ensure equal opportunities for all its residents. The region takes steps forward by actively promoting diversity and tackling discrimination through legislation and initiatives. Inclusive policies address issues such as employment equity, 2SLGBTQ+ rights, accessibility, and immigrant integration. The Toronto Region's commitment to inclusivity is reflected in programs that support marginalized communities, provide language services, and create safe spaces for diverse populations. These policies promote social cohesion, empower individuals, and contribute to making the Toronto Region a welcoming and inclusive city.

The report outlines why Toronto is so attractive to young people to move to, but questions why they choose to stay. Well, we have the answers. Here are five reasons why young people flock to the Toronto Region for good. EDUCATION: There is no shortage of top-notch education in a wide variety of fields with 18 colleges and universities in and around the Toronto Region. Whether it’s a Bachelor of Commerce at University of Toronto’s renowned Rotman School of Management or a Bachelor of Animation at Sheridan College – also known as the “Harvard of Animation” – there is something for everyone at postsecondary institutions in our region. More than 370,000 international students choose to learn their desired skill in the Toronto Region, and Canada’s favourable student immigration policies make it easy to stay. In 2022, over 46,000 international students in the Toronto Region held a Post-Graduate Work Permit, allowing them to work in Canada for any employer for up to three years. After the three years is up, many choose to apply for permanent residency to continue their career that was built here. DIVERSITY: The Urban Work Index marks that diversity is the fourth most important trait that young people value in their place of residence, even more than education. If young people are looking for diversity, there is nowhere in the world more diverse than the Toronto Region. The cities of Brampton, Mississauga and Toronto all ranked in the top three spots for equity diversity and inclusion. Roughly half of the Toronto Region is foreign born, with over 250 ethnicities and 190 languages represented. Residents of the Toronto Region feel at home here because they can find a small piece of their home wherever they go. Mississauga has the largest number of Japanese companies in Canada, Brampton’s population is 38 percent of South-Asian descent, the most common language in Markham is Cantonese. All these communities are the reason why young people from all over the world feel comfortable staying in the Toronto Region. TRANSPORTATION: The formerly stated cities and more make up the Toronto Region, which means that they are all accessible by GO Transit, our regional transit system comprised of over 1,200 kilometres of transit routes and over 6,000 services per week. GO trains and buses allow young people to live anywhere in the Toronto Region while working elsewhere with ease, as GO trains travel beyond the region into the cities of Hamilton and Waterloo. Climate action was noted as an important factor for young people, which goes hand in hand with public transportation. GO Transit’s operator, Metrolinx, announced in 2017 a target of having electric trains running every 15 minutes in both directions within the most heavily travelled sections of the GO train network. With GO Transit across the region and TTC in Toronto, young people may never have to drive again – and if they do, they will be living in the region that produced Canada’s first zero-emission vehicle. It’s safe to say the options are endless when it comes to transportation in the Toronto Region. ECONOMY: The Toronto Region is the second-largest financial centre in North America, and the largest in Canada. As Canada’s financial centre, the Toronto Region’s diverse industrial make-up contributes about 20 percent to the country’s total GDP. In an age of economic uncertainty for young people, the Toronto Region’s economy is resilient. We surpassed pre-pandemic levels of employment by the end of 2021 and our job numbers continue to grow steadily. With 38 percent of Canada's multinational headquarters and nearly half of Fortune 500 companies located in the Toronto Region, there is ample opportunity for young people to enter the workforce and join an economy they can count on. ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT: Young people want to be in the room where it happens, and at the risk of boasting, that room is most often in the Toronto Region. For example, Sheridan Animation grad, Domee Shi, became the first woman to solely direct a Pixar film and went on to win an Academy Award for her 2018 short film Bao. Shi is just one of countless students from the Toronto Region who use their experience here to innovate, inspire and do something that has never been done before. In the Toronto Region, we believe that quality of life plays a role in innovation and entrepreneurship. Home to five major professional sports teams, countless theatres and event venues – including the oldest operating theatre in North America, the Royal Alexandra Theatre – young people in the Toronto Region can enjoy their five to nine after their nine to five.

THE SURGE OF CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE TORONTO REGION: The Toronto Region is renowned globally for three main traits: tech, creativity, and quality of life. Yesterday, Interactive Ontario – with a number of partners, including the City of Toronto – released a report focusing on the first two attributes and how they intersect to create the Creative Technology sector. It is no secret that tech is booming in the Toronto Region, but how does this impact creative industries like film, animation, and gaming? “Ontario’s Next Gen Industry” report answers this question and shows businesses how they can tap into the fast-growing Creative Tech industry in Ontario. WHAT IS CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY? The Creative Technology industry covers a range of sub-sectors, including animation, film, virtual and augmented reality, VFX and other forms of virtual production. The Toronto Region belongs to the top three largest screen-based industries in North America, employing more than 30,000 people in the film sector alone. A staple contributor is Pinewood Studios in Toronto, home to iconic creations such as The Little Mermaid (2023) Stephen King’s IT (2017-2019), Star Trek: Discovery (2017-2019) and many more. Studios in the City of Markham have produced makings such as The Boys (2022) and Women Talking (2022). Continuing this streak, Markham is building the largest studio in Canada funded in part by Ryan Reynolds, equipped with 20 sound stages. The City of Mississauga is planning for a 450,000 square foot studio to create around 5,000 long-term jobs in the film industry. Studios are making television history across the Toronto Region. Facilities like these utilize tech innovations from the over 289,000 skilled professionals employed in the Toronto Region tech industry and beyond, furthering the creative tech industry. The Toronto Region’s Animation/VFX industry alone has had a 42 percent growth in the past five years. In the 2020-2021 academic year, postsecondary institutions enrolled over 1,200 students in a game and interactive media program, while 1,400 students enrolled in an animation-related program. With tech advancements happening here every day, and some of the most generous tax incentives in the world, it is only natural that our bustling media industry takes hold of these opportunities to innovate and inspire audiences around the world. KEY FINDINGS: We took away 4 main findings from the “Ontario’s Next Gen Industry” report. 1.	Creative technology talent demand is apparent for senior and mid-level positions, and immigration is the solution. Due to the fast-growing nature of the tech industry, the creative tech field is still relatively new, therefore entry-level talent is more abundant than senior level. Despite having a robust and highly skilled creative tech talent pipeline, domestic experienced professionals in this field are seldom in the market for work. Increased clarity on immigration pathways will help creative tech studios hire senior-level talent from all over the world. 2.	A focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion is vital to talent attraction, with a focus on inclusivity. Current demographic trends point to a future where 40 percent of Canadians will be from a racialized group. In present day, 50 percent of the population in the Toronto Region self-identify as a visible minority. Despite a diverse talent pool and comparatively diverse tech sector, there are still opportunities to promote inclusivity in creative tech fields by closing the gender gap, battling systemic biases, and improving participation in leadership positions from underrepresented groups. 3.	Local postsecondary institutions provide high-quality programs but still require further adaptation to meet evolving market needs. Tech is fast moving; Ontario postsecondaries are ahead of the curve in offering a diverse array of studies surrounding creative tech. However, educational programs across the board need to be more tailored to real-world trends in digital media. Micro-credentials is a great way to do this, which has already been implemented by Ontario Tech University. 4.	Ontario’s creative tech sector is a healthy blend of small studios and large multinationals. The Creative Tech sector in Ontario has been very resilient, especially during the pandemic. The key to keeping the industry resilient and maintaining steady growth is attracting large multinational studios while supporting the growth of startups with government incentives. Attracting large-scale companies also creates a ‘spillover effect’ for senior-level talent attraction for small studios, which is currently in demand.

MANUFACTURING MATTERS: THE LONG-AWAITED MANUFACTURING RENAISSANCE? “Is this the moment?... Is this the tipping point?” These are the immediate questions I asked myself when I read the announcement that Volkswagen was going to build a battery cell plant in St. Thomas, Ontario. Put another way, the top OEM in the world is building a leading-edge manufacturing facility along Ontario’s existing automotive corridor, which will help spur a structural industry transformation. I couldn’t have been more thrilled at the news! We haven’t had an OEM of this size enter Canada in over 35 years. So, the idea of adding a second electric battery plant almost one year after Stellantis and LG Energy Solutions made their landmark announcement in Windsor put a shockingly large smile on my face! The decline of the manufacturing sector in Ontario is well known and documented. Offshoring really started to become a trend in the late 1990s and the financial crisis of 2007/08 seemed to have accelerated it even more. Many of my family members have made and continue to make a living from manufacturing, in particular the auto sector, so I have an understanding how this downward slide has impacted not just families but whole communities as well. For years now I’ve been reading about the possibility of a “manufacturing renaissance” in Canada, but I haven’t really been able to envision how it would take hold… let alone begin. This idea really picked up steam during the pandemic, with reshoring being a possible solution to all the calamitous supply chain disruptions we were experiencing. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always been a proponent of a domestic manufacturing sector, but I still didn’t fully buy into the idea of a large-scale reindustrialization taking place given how cost-centric global supply chains tend to be. I had many thoughts after the Volkswagen announcement, which made me start to believe that this is indeed the beginning of something much bigger. But two ideas in particular have been the locus of my thinking since I read the news: The industrial commons is a collection of resources that a manufacturer in a given industry can draw upon to maintain or improve its competitiveness as well as drive innovation. This collection consists of, but is not necessarily limited to, the skills and knowledge of the labour force, supplier networks, customers, trade schools, colleges and universities and even competitors. Having the world’s largest OEM enter Ontario’s existing automotive ecosystem, by adding what will be a second gigafactory, is an unprecedented addition to the industrial commons.  No doubt the majority of the impact will be noticeable in the automotive sector, but skills and knowledge gained here will transfer to some degree into other manufacturing sectors as well. It can be easily argued that the automotive industry is undergoing its largest transformation since factory electrification. The irony here is palpable. But, I believe we have a real differentiator in Ontario when compared to what I see happening in the U.S. auto sector. All of Ontario’s OEMs are effectively contained within a 550-kilometer corridor of major highways. But, when you look at a map of the assembly plants in the U.S., it is a virtual scattershot all over the eastern half of the country. Proximity is important for two reasons. First and most obvious, the closer your shipping and final delivery points are to each other usually translates to lower transportation costs. But it’s the second reason that I find much more interesting. There’s still a great deal of innovation taking place and with that, having suppliers in closer proximity to their customers allows for more effective (and more frequent) in-person collaboration between the two. This can be crucial when there’s a need to be first-to-market and when dealing with a great deal of manufacturing precision required for final assembly. A manufacturing renaissance is something that has been discussed for decades. It’s always seemed that no matter how many great ideas have been developed, there has never been enough real traction in order to make these ideas come to fruition. But, given what I’ve seen over the last year, combined with Volkswagen’s recent gigafactory announcement, I can’t help but feel optimistic that now is the moment where our regional manufacturing sector really starts to take off. I can’t wait to find out if I’m right!

REGION TO ACCOMMODATE RAPID GROWTH: Enable is a rapidly growing software tech company that specializes in cloud based B2B (business to business) rebate management solutions. B2B companies can run into obstacles when managing the data that shows which customer deserves what value rebate at what benchmark. This obstacle is what Enable aims to solve. Enable expanded to the Toronto Region just last year and has experienced tremendous growth in that time. Enable recently landed $94 million in funding to add to its Toronto team and maintain its high-quality services. We sat down with Enable CEO and Co-founder Andrew Butt to discuss how the Enable team is managing this growth and what brought them to this point. At this time last year, we had 25 employees in Toronto, and were making a bet on the city as our North American operational headquarters. Now we just onboarded our 128th Enablee (Enable employee) in the Toronto office. The growth has been astonishing, and Toronto’s talent pool has helped us keep pace. Overall, by the end of this year we’ll have 435 employees throughout the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. We will continue to hire and build the team across all departments and geographies in the coming year. This has been a big year of growth for us. In Toronto specifically, we’re hiring for sales, product, engineering, marketing, finance, people, customer success, information technology, and workplaces. At the start of the year, we had one floor in our building at 545 King Street West and had no idea how we would use all that space. Fast forward to today, and we’ve just taken on an additional floor in Toronto, giving us a total of nearly 15,000 square feet. We selected Toronto as the headquarters for our North American operations because of its amazing tech talent pool. This combined with the overall quality of life, the walkability of the city – especially in the downtown area where we’re based – and the unique cultural aspects the city exudes. Finally, it’s such an easy place to get to and such a lovely city to spend time in. Our global teams regularly gather in Toronto because of how easy it is for us to travel and connect there. We want to keep creating an immense amount of value for our customers so that we can continue to help ease the friction that exists in today’s supply chain. If we can do this well, not only is this good for Enable and our continued growth in the rebate management category, but it’s also good for businesses overall. The more seamlessly they can serve as an extension of one another, the easier it is to build a healthy, thriving ecosystem at every stage of the supply chain. When this happens, it’s great for the partners in the supply chain, the businesses and consumers that are on the buying end of the supply chain, and the overall diversity of the supply chain. The more diverse, local, and seamless we can make our supply chain, the more resilient it will be. That’s what we want to solve, and we’ll keep building with our clients and increasing their collaborative partners until we get there. Our North American revenue and customer success teams operate out of Toronto, so we’re always looking for more candidates to support our efforts there. We also have members of our product, engineering, marketing, finance, people, information technology, and workplaces teams in Toronto. Each of these teams has grown quite a bit in Toronto already this year. Always talk with your customers, those who you’d like to be your customers, those that look like your customers, or those that are around them. I aim to meet new people every day. Some of this happens naturally when helping to sell the value of Enable and when meeting with customers, there’s almost always a new face in the room. Meeting new people in general can be very helpful to understanding your market, your fit, and what additional problems you might be able to solve. So, it is important to think of investors, customers, other founders and CEOs, thought leaders, and yes, prospects. I’ve experienced the most success in the least likely connections. It’s serendipity, and it’s fueled a lot of Enable’s success.

Microart is an electronic manufacturing and design services company based in Markham, the unsuspecting home of an evolved and concentrated ecosystem of global hardware tech players and specialized talent, bred from one generation to the next. How did this hub come to be? As one of the fastest growing municipalities in Ontario and a key economic driver of York Region, Markham has a history of contract manufacturers setting up shop. We sat down with Charles Tonna, Executive Vice President at Microart, to talk about the development of the local hardware technology ecosystem and why its future is in the Toronto Region. WHAT DOES MICROART DO? Our company is a contract manufacturer that provides printed circuit board (PCB) layout, PCB assembly, PCBA test development, and box build/ general manufacturing services  for proto-type and low-to-mid volume production. Since Microart’s inception 40 years ago, we’ve provided complete circuit board assembly services to Canada and the U.S. In our Markham location, we have more than 300 employees working on up to a thousand different products in an advanced manufacturing facility that includes the latest in design, production, and testing equipment. Every piece of tech has a different PCBA in it – your phone alone has three! To put it simply, Microart starts out with a raw circuit board, places components on the board (such as microchips and semiconductors), and designs around the populated board to produce hardware for a range of customers across North America, bringing household tech to people like you and me. WHAT’S THE HISTORY OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURING IN MARKHAM? Well, it all started with IBM. Since 1983, IBM’s Canadian headquarters has been based in Markham, making it the cornerstone of our tech community since then. With IBM’s reputation, the local population were incentivized to join its workforce – more and more people became trained and certified in hardware engineering, gaining specialized experience in advanced manufacturing. Once IBM brought attention to the pool of untapped talent in York Region, other large companies like Celestica (who I call the mothership of Canadian contract manufacturing) came to the region. However, once these manufacturers started downsizing a few decades later, they were left with a large amount of experience in technology, giving rise and opportunity for even more companies to arrive and start tapping into the region’s hardware tech space. Players like SMTC, Creation, Artaflex, Radient, Bittele, you name it – they came. And that’s how IBM turned the global manufacturing industry’s attention to Markham, Ontario. IS THAT WHY MICROART CHOSE MARKHAM? Microart’s President and CEO, Mark Wood, was born and raised in Markham. He wanted to give back to the community, creating jobs for the local economy and nurturing the labour pool of thousands of people who were already educated, certified, and highly experienced in the legacy of electronics manufacturing. Moreover, the quality and diversity of Markham’s workforce can’t be found anywhere else. We have a workforce largely comprised of immigrants and mature workers with decades of experience on the production floor. At Microart, we are focused on culture as the best way to retain talent – treating our people like family and an integral part of our team, with an understanding of our shared history in York Region. HOW DOES MICROART LEVERAGE THE TORONTO REGION’S TALENT POOL? One of our mottos: “Turn your job into a career.” The best thing about our industry is that you don’t need a college degree to join the Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) industry. For those looking for an entry-level job, you can start on our production line and in 5 years’ time, you can grow into a program manager – because we invest in our people first and foremost. This is why Microart works closely with postsecondary institutions across the Toronto Region to develop our domestic talent. I myself am on the board at Durham College, and Microart has an apprenticeship program in conjunction with Canadore College, based out of North Bay, Ontario. Our 4 apprenticeship routes include: hardware technicians, network technicians, microelectronics manufacturers, and Surface Mount technicians. HOW DOES MICROART CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUTURE OF HARDWARE TECH IN CANADA? Organizations, like ventureLAB, partner with us to grow our talent pipeline and connect us with those who are looking to grow a career. By participating as a partner in ventureLAB’s Accelerate AI program, a 6-month program funded through Scale AI (Canada's AI Global Innovation Cluster), we give back by supporting, growing and scaling AI startups in the supply chain industry. The manufacturing industry in Markham has an interesting history of being very reciprocally connected, and that has not changed. We are glad to have the opportunity to make partnerships and find the best talent in York Region.

Rising temperatures, melting glaciers, treacherous storms—the impacts of climate change are real and happening right now. It’s no longer a question of whether or not to take action. This global crisis needs immediate, effective resolve, and it’s imperative that governments, businesses and industries work together to figure out how. That’s where the Brookfield Sustainability Institute comes in: providing smart solutions to make it happen. “We attract the best people from around the world to work on applied projects that assist companies, governments, non-profits or foundations doing work in sustainability, and try to create solutions that transform the marketplace,” says Luigi Ferrara, BSI’s chair and CEO. This first-of-its-kind college-based centre of excellence in Ontario tackles challenges posed by climate change, bringing together knowledge and expertise from a wide range of professionals, business leaders, scholars, community activists and climate change experts to develop viable ways to achieve net zero. And as Canada’s target is to reach zero emissions by 2050, with Toronto aiming for 2040—one of the most ambitious goals in North America—partners are eager to collaborate with BSI to pursue their own sustainability initiatives. “They need people who can help provide and teach them new approaches, new techniques, new ways of doing things,” says Ferrara. Tackling real-world issues: Companies like the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) are already tapping into BSI’s wealth of talent and resources. RBC’s Climate Action Institute recently worked with BSI on a new report on how to reduce emissions created by the housing industry. “Decarbonization of the built environment is an enormous task,” says Ferrara. To demonstrate the types of buildings that must be constructed in order to reach Toronto’s net-zero goals, BSI will soon be headquartered at George Brown College’s Limberlost Place. The 10-storey structure on Toronto’s waterfront will be the first mass-timber and low-carbon building in Ontario. “Limberlost Place has pioneered a new structural system for wood buildings with a passive mechanical design that performs at net-zero carbon,” says Ferrara. BSI is also currently working on such sustainable projects as developing a circular-fashion apparel brand, creating portable energy solutions for remote communities and designing eco-conscious neighbourhoods. The aim is to apply these real-world solutions as soon as possible. Empowering future leaders: Each of these projects benefits from George Brown College’s agile academic environment, as BSI is able to train workers on the latest technologies. The integrated program helps equip new graduates with the skills they need to confront climate change. Students apply what they have learned in the classroom to solve real-world problems for companies. “If you bring students together with employers to work on solutions for communities, innovation happens in the companies themselves,” says Ferrara. “It’s a learning paradigm with tremendous power—a new type of innovator that we need moving forward.” For George Brown, BSI strengthens its commitment to providing graduates with the ability to innovate, adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world. “The Brookfield Sustainability Institute is one of the many exciting new developments underway at George Brown College, both in terms of its innovation and its environmental impact,” says Dr. Gervan Fearon, president of George Brown College. “The institute highlights the college’s aim to be a sustainability leader and a force for positive environmental change locally and globally.”

Municipal World: Ontario municipalities and their citizens are marking an important anniversary with the arrival of this new year. It has been exactly 10 years since they embarked upon what was heralded as a “new era” in municipal accountability – an era that is still evolving. On January 1, 2008, the transparency and accountability of local governments was enhanced considerably. Although the Municipal Act, 2001 required local councils and board meetings to be open to the public (with certain limited exceptions), the only way to challenge a closed meeting prior to 2008 was through the courts, a costly option open to few. That year, changes to the law enabled members of the public to complain about closed meetings of municipal councils, local boards, or committees – and have their complaints investigated. For many in the municipal sphere, 2008 was also when a new word entered their vocabulary: “Ombudsman.” Under the Act, the Ontario Ombudsman was the default investigator for complaints about closed meetings. If a municipality did not appoint its own investigator for such complaints, the Ontario Ombudsman would conduct the investigation, free of charge. If the investigation deemed the meeting illegal – that is, if it didn’t fit within the narrow circumstances outlined in the Act, under which closed meetings were permissible – there would be a public report and recommendations. Ten years later, municipal accountability has continued to grow. On January 1, 2016, the office’s mandate was expanded to include not just closed meetings, but oversight of all aspects of municipal government and services.[1]  As of New Year’s Day 2018, new amendments to the Act further refined the open meeting rules, adding four new exceptions and a much-needed definition of “meeting.” And ... in 2019, every municipality will also be required to have a code of conduct and provide public access to an integrity commissioner. The introduction of the closed meeting investigator regime in Ontario was not always smooth sailing. The Ombudsman’s Office was unfamiliar to many at the local level, despite four decades of experience in resolving complaints about the provincial government. Not only that, enforcing the open meeting rules – narrowly defined by law – took some getting used to for an office like ours, whose key role has always been informal resolution. While the open meeting regime is quite different from the office's regular oversight activities, it nonetheless adds value though validation of processes or constructive feedback on how municipalities and local boards can improve governance through enhanced transparency. Despite the challenges and learning curve for all stakeholders that came with the 2008 amendments, many benefits have surfaced. And the feared flood of complaints did not materialize. As the investigator for almost 200 of Ontario’s 444 municipalities, the Ombudsman's Office receives roughly 100 complaints per year (related to a still smaller number of meetings). The only year that bucked this trend was 2013, when high-profile closed meetings in just two cities – London and Sudbury – accounted for more than 100 complaints from concerned citizens. Those cases demonstrated the strong public interest in open meetings, which was later amplified in local elections. But overall, the complaint rate remained steady. A little-known fact about the received complaints is that many were from council members themselves. They often turned to the office in confidence, driven by concerns or confusion about whether they and their colleagues were following the open meeting rules. This turned out to be an excellent educational opportunity as clerks, CAOs, provincial officials and, of course, Ombudsman staff developed and spread the word about best practices for transparent and publicly accountable meeting procedures. And, it ultimately paved the way for improved accountability mechanisms at the local level, including codes of conduct and integrity commissioners, and even local Ombudsman services, all of which are increasingly being embraced by municipalities now. Slowly but surely, municipalities have also begun to record their closed meetings – a recommended best practice. This is a remarkable change, given that, back in 2008, it was not uncommon to discover councils where the mistaken belief was that even taking minutes in closed meetings was against the law. (In fact, the reverse is true, and recordings contribute to an accurate record and efficient investigations.) Today, the most common concerns heard from municipalities are not that different from those of 10 years ago. Fears persist that a sudden flood of complaints to the Ombudsman or to local accountability mechanisms will tax their limited resources. This, too, is an important educational opportunity.

The role of an ombudsman is to promote accountability, transparency, and fairness in the public sector. This mandate is fulfilled by receiving citizens’ complaints about a branch of government or a public sector body, determining whether the complaint has merit, and if so, working collaboratively with stakeholders to get the problem resolved. As an independent and impartial officer, it is important for the ombudsman to have credibility with, and the trust of, all stakeholders. The ombudsman’s office is not an advocate for the complainant nor a defender of the public sector bodies within its jurisdiction. Demonstrating impartiality and fairness is essential to building the productive and appropriate relationships necessary for the ombudsman to be able to effect positive change. That sometimes involves validating the work done by a public sector body or branch of government (giving credit where credit is due), as much as shining a light on instances of maladministration or lapses in administrative fairness. The work done and the relationships established in the day-to-day interactions between the ombudsman’s office and public sector bodies in resolving individual complaints will have a tremendous impact on the ombudsman’s effectiveness in reporting on systemic issues and making recommendations for changes in policy and procedure. If ombudsman offices only look at individual complaints in isolation, they miss the opportunity to address root causes of complaints and recommend corrective actions designed to prevent them from recurring. This is why systemic investigations are so important and why they provide an opportunity for the ombudsman to have such significant positive impact on society. The ombudsman is uniquely positioned to propose solutions to problems that affect vast segments of society. The key to adding maximum value is getting the ombudsman’s recommendations accepted and implemented. The Office of the Ombudsman of Ontario has successfully deployed several techniques for doing this, which we describe later in this paper. What I want to underscore, however, is what comes first: The process of getting recommendations accepted begins before they are even presented. START FROM A POSITION OF TRUST: It begins with relationship building. That involves establishing credibility and trust with all stakeholders, including the public sector bodies the ombudsman oversees. Trust and credibility are gained in large measure by employing a fair and credible process. If an ombudsman is going to promote procedural fairness, he or she must “walk the talk” and be fair in the investigative process. This involves providing advance notice of the systemic investigation – ideally by the ombudsman meeting with the head of the organization, to explain the reasons for the investigation, to pledge a fair and impartial investigative process, to underscore that a collaborative approach is preferred, and to invite input and commentary from the organization at any time. DEMONSTRATE VALUE: Whenever possible, it is helpful to demonstrate to the organization that the ombudsman’s systemic investigation will provide value; it serves not only the public interest, but can be in the best interest of the organization as well. Either the organization’s work will be validated by an independent third party – which can be a great boost for internal morale – or constructive feedback will be provided that will enable it to address the root causes of complaints and prevent recurrence. One of the things I try to impress upon the leadership of public sector bodies is that they should not fear or try to discourage complaints. Rather, progressive and forward-looking organizations should embrace complaints as opportunities to enhance relationships with stakeholders and improve operations. As Microsoft’s Bill Gates had said, “a dissatisfied customer is your best source of feedback.” If people think an organization is unfair or not concerned about treating them properly, they will be less likely to engage with it and accept its decisions. Then the organization has to devote time, energy, and money to dealing with appeals, litigation, and the costs of non-compliance. Conversely, if stakeholders feel they have been heard and treated fairly, they are more likely to accept the organization’s actions and decisions. By being responsive to complaints, and accepting and implementing the ombudsman’s recommendations to address systemic issues, a public sector body can demonstrate that it puts a priority on fairness and sound administration. That in turn will enhance the public's faith and confidence in that organization. Quite often, an ombudsman’s systemic investigation addresses an issue that middle management is aware of and would like to rectify, but cannot secure the resources to address adequately. Once the ombudsman’s report becomes public, it is not uncommon for resources to become available and for the leadership to be grateful for the ombudsman’s intervention. I call this a “win-win-win” result.

Municipal World: On January 1, 2016, citizens of Ontario will finally be able to bring their municipal complaints to their provincial Ombudsman. For readers in B.C., New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon, this won’t seem like news – their ombudsmen have long had jurisdiction over municipalities, dealing with complaints about everything from misuse of public funds to bylaw changes. But in Ontario, New Year’s Day will mark the start of a new era of accountability at the local level. The passage of “Bill 8” – the Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act, 2014 – opens the broader public sector to independent oversight for the first time. For those who may not know, “Ombudsman” is a Swedish word meaning “citizen’s representative,” and is an independent official who investigates complaints from the public about maladministration in government. In Ontario, the Ombudsman is one of seven independent officers of the legislature who oversee various aspects of the provincial government. Last year, the Ombudsman’s office handled more than 23,000 complaints, helping citizens with everything from incorrect tuition, to receiving medical care in correctional facilities, to wrong and confusing hydro bills. However, complaints about the so-called “MUSH” sector (municipalities, universities, school boards, hospitals, long-term care, police and children’s aid societies) have remained outside of the office’s jurisdiction since Ontario’s first Ombudsman Arthur Maloney was appointed in 1975. Mr. Maloney had barely been in office a year when he observed that it was a mistake to leave the broader public sector out of Ombudsman oversight, because “these bodies have important decision-making powers and take actions which affect the lives of all of us.” Since 2005 alone, the Ombudsman’s office has had to turn away more than 24,000 “MUSH” complaints. More than 10,500 of those were about municipalities, making them the most complained-about area of the sector by far. Complaints about municipalities ran the gamut from garbage collection and snow removal to conflict of interest and the conduct of council members. Many citizens expressed the view that they had nowhere else to turn for independent review of their local concerns. As of January 1, that will change. With that in mind, now is the ideal time to address some of the most common questions that have come from the public and municipal officials about what Ombudsman oversight will mean to them. HOW THE OMBUDSMAN’S OFFICE WORKS The Ombudsman’s office accepts complaints through email, fax, web form, telephone and in person. It does not charge fees to complainants; in fact, all services are free of charge (the office is funded through the provincial treasury). Complaints made to the office are strictly confidential and all investigations are conducted in private; complainants are never identified without consent. Ombudsman staff will treat municipal complaints just as they do provincial complaints: Assessing each one to see if they are able to help, and referring them back to existing accountability mechanisms wherever possible. If the problem cannot be solved at the local level, then they may step in to ask the municipality for more information. Where needed, the Ombudsman’s team will conduct independent investigations of individual and systemic issues, and issue recommendations to help improve government administration, service and accountability. Many Ontarians are familiar with the Ombudsman’s large-scale systemic investigations, which have resulted in published reports and recommendations for significant changes – almost all of which have been accepted and implemented by the provincial government since 2005. For example, in 2006, the provincially-run Municipal Property Assessment Corporation was overhauled according to the Ombudsman’s recommendations in the wake of a systemic investigation into almost 4,000 complaints. And in 2015, Hydro One agreed to fix its billing and customer service problems after the Ombudsman’s systemic investigation into almost 11,000 complaints. Still, the vast majority of cases brought to the Ombudsman team are resolved quickly, informally and usually within two weeks. Numerous cases have been resolved this way at the provincial level, with Ombudsman staff proactively working with senior bureaucrats to alert them to serious problems, often addressing them to the satisfaction of all concerned. The Ombudsman’s office has a strong record of working constructively and co-operatively with government bodies to resolve issues, and plans to continue that trend when working with municipalities. In cases where a formal investigation is necessary – that is, the issue can’t be easily resolved – the municipality in question will be given notice and a chance to respond before any report is finalized.

AN IMPACTFUL YEAR Despite the challenges of working remotely, we continued our compassionate and impactful work this past year, as the stories and statistics in this report demonstrate. We received 25,161 cases – complaints and inquiries – between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022, an increase of 25% over the previous fiscal year. A substantial number of these continued to be driven by the COVID-19 pandemic – such as vaccine mandates in universities and colleges, and ongoing delays in many of the provincial programs we oversee. But a large portion involved the sort of complex administrative issues that have always been our forte – such as helping families access developmental services or social benefits. As usual, we resolved the vast majority of these cases without formal investigation, and most of them (52%) within two weeks. As always, helping vulnerable people with difficult or unfair systems was a priority. For example, we escalated the complaints of Ontarians with disabilities who were not able to renew their health cards online because they did not have driver’s licences, and the system has since been changed. Our staff helped numerous inmates access health care services. Recently, we even made sure that Ukrainians fleeing the war in their country were able to cut through red tape and obtain Ontario driver’s licences quickly. We published two investigative reports this spring – one on French Language Services Commissioner Kelly Burke’s investigation into cuts to French-language programs at Laurentian University, and the other on my investigation of the sudden closure of youth justice programs in Northern Ontario. All of our recommendations in both cases were accepted. Our work on two highly complex systemic investigations – into delays at the Landlord and Tenant Board and the government’s monitoring of long-term care homes during the pandemic – also progressed substantially, and we look forward to their completion in the coming months. In the municipal sector, we received a record number of complaints as municipalities dealt with, and sometimes struggled with, the legal and technical aspects of holding virtual and hybrid meetings while respecting the open meeting requirements of the Municipal Act, 2001. We issued dozens of reports and letters to help municipalities follow these rules, adding to the rich database of decisions available in our Open Meeting Digest online. General issues about municipalities – part of our mandate since 2016 – also continued to generate more cases than almost anything else. Questions about the role of the Ombudsman are not new, of course. The good news is that the past few years have seen remarkable progress in international recognition of this role as essential to democracy, and a clear set of principles to define it. Following the 2019 proclamation of the Venice Principles – a set of 25 global standards to ensure stable, independent and effective ombudsman institutions around the world – the United Nations General Assembly endorsed those principles in December 2020 in its Resolution on the Role of Ombudsman and Mediator Institutions. These declarations – which we have set out in detail in the next section of this report, About our Office – are important steps in setting global standards and protections for the ombudsman institution. They enhance the ability of offices like this one to promote fair administration, human rights, good governance and the rule of law. Collectively and individually, my international colleagues and I continue to work on ways to inform our governments, citizens, and stakeholders about those principles, as well as put them into practice through self-assessment and peer review. In May 2022, I was pleased to be able to join my fellow members of the International Ombudsman Institute’s Board of Directors at our Annual Meeting in New York – our first in-person meeting in three years – where we had productive sessions with several missions and permanent representatives to the United Nations to promote the Resolution and the Venice Principles, and strengthen our ties with the UN. Such progress is a hopeful and fitting sign for a world that is yearning to overcome the heavy challenges of the past two years. Throughout this time, we have demonstrated through reports like this one that independent oversight of public services is essential for the protection of citizens. It is equally important that the concept of independent oversight itself be protected.

Translating Global Goals into Pragmatic Projects New York City was the first city in the United States to align its ambitious sustainability goals with those of the world. Our purpose is to support NYC in its work to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — “localizing the SDGs.” Launched in 2019 at the Center for Sustainable Business (CSB) at the New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business, Invest NYC SDG is a multi-year initiative designed to help build a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban economy in New York City. Using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) as a framework, we catalyze projects by engaging government, the private sector, and community stakeholders to tackle some of the major challenges of our time, such as reducing carbon emissions, supporting equitable and sustainable urban mobility, and addressing food insecurity. While housed at an academic institution, Invest NYC SDG is not primarily a research project. Research provides the basis of this project, but our main goal is to leverage the convening power and influence of NYU to inspire collaboration between the public, private, philanthropic, social, and academic sectors to accelerate the development of new, sustainable businesses and organizations in New York City. As the first city in the world to systematically align its sustainability goals with the UN SDGs, New York City has created an important foundation with its sustainable development plans. Invest NYC SDG builds upon that foundation and helps pave the way for progress. We are working to identify the best private-sector business and finance opportunities where there are significant interested key players, realistic business incentives, alignment with government policies, partnerships with communities, and significant impact in meeting the SDGs. Through concrete projects in NYC, we are also identifying government policies and/or finance innovations needed to be successful. With this work, we are creating a road map and tool kit for other cities, both in the U.S. and internationally, to take on the SDGs with strong private-sector support. Government Needs the Private Sector New York City's long-term strategic plan and Green New Deal, OneNYC 2050, was created in alignment with the UN SDGs. Systemic change, however, requires engagement and collaboration between the private and public sectors, at both regional and local government levels. The opportunities are myriad: the UN Business and Sustainable Development Commission's 2017 Better Business, Better World report identified $12 trillion in business opportunity through multi-stakeholder interaction. The Private Sector Needs Government Effective private-sector investment in advancing the SDGs means understanding that the focus areas in this project are largely supported by public infrastructure, and owned and operated by public entities. This infrastructure requires ongoing management and maintenance within changing physical and financial environments. Real constraints exist for governmental action, particularly as agencies are pushed to do more within the SDG framework. Government entities also face regulations that can inhibit their ability to partner with the private sector in developing innovative projects and policy. But systemic policy and operational change can take place. NYU Stern CSB Creates the Space and Supports the Conversation The NYU Center for Sustainable Business is creating the platform for multi-stakeholder engagement. As a major research university, trusted by public- and private-sector stakeholders, NYU brings a broad academic community with many departments engaged in SDG issues. Leveraging these resources, NYU Stern CSB connects important stakeholders among the public sector, interest organizations, and the private sector (including both the corporate and finance sectors) to develop a shared vision of how private-sector investment can be stimulated in partnership with the public and non-governmental sectors.

These days, the traditional wheat fields that make up the “breadbasket of Canada” – the Canadian Prairies – are more likely to be sharing space with another crop: pulses. “Increasingly, it’s not a breadbasket. I’d call it a bean pot. It’s more about a wider range,” agribusiness industry expert Rory McAlpine conveyed during an event at Future Food-Tech Alternative Proteins in New York City recently, hosted by Invest in Canada. Wheat is still a large crop, especially in western Canada, but pulses are growing in size and significance. Now accounting for millions of acres of cropland in Canada, pulses are a big contributor to Canada’s agricultural revenues. Mr. McAlpine, who has worked in senior agricultural roles in both the private and public sector in Canada, knows firsthand the very positive economic benefits created by this diversity into pulse crops. Pulses – the dry, edible seeds that include beans, peas, and lentils from the legume family – are a foundational crop for the rapidly expanding plant protein industry.  And Canada is the world’s largest exporter of pulses. Pulses are leading the way toward future food that is healthy, delicious and sustainably produced. At the Future Food-Tech Alternative Proteins Summit, held June 27–28 this year in the heart of Manhattan, Mr. McAlpine joined Invest in Canada CEO Laurel Broten to dig deeper into the alternative protein advantages that are making Canada a preferred location for future-looking agri-food investors globally. How Canada has achieved 39% of global market share in pulses Asked by Ms. Broten to explain how Canada has been able to lead the world in pulse exports, Mr. McAlpine described sustainability as one of the reasons. “Adding pulse crops has created a real sustainability benefit,” Mr. McAlpine said, pointing to the climate resilience of pulses. He also addressed how pulse crops improve carbon sequestration: “When you talk specifically about climate change, there’s some really great new data actually measuring on a life-cycle analysis basis, what is the carbon sequestration of specific pulse crops in Canada.” “Pulse Canada has done this work and it’s pretty cool. They can calculate a carbon-negative number associated with key pulse crops in Canada and equate that to so many million cars taken off the road. And that’s based on real hard data – actual production data on specific farms in various commodities in Canada.” Canada’s labour force advantages Harvesting the right crops is vital for industry prosperity and environmental sustainability, but there is an even more important component opening up value-added agriculture opportunities. “In many ways we talk about this as all about ‘What are the critical ingredients for the future?’” said Mr. McAlpine. “Well, the single biggest ingredient, actually, is people. The workforce, the talent pool built off that history of agrifood and science and innovation is extremely important.” In response to Ms. Broten inquiring about labour force challenges, Mr. McAlpine acknowledged that labour shortages are global, but Canada has a dual advantage: strong population growth along with high-quality education to fill all the different types of positions the industry needs. “What’s important in this space to remember: it’s not just about high-skilled,” Mr. McAlpine said. “It’s about semi-skilled, low-skilled too. If you’re going to have a value chain approach and need the labour at all stages, you need all three.” In addition to an educational system that the OECD ranks the best in the world in terms of tertiary education, Canada is also seeing the highest population growth among G7 countries. “In one year, one million new Canadians,” Mr. McAlpine said. “The rate of immigration is, frankly, extraordinary…. The attractiveness of Canada to the global talent pool is unquestioned.”

As 2022 came to a close, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Canada remained steady with Statistics Canada reporting quarterly net inflows of $17.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, a figure 21.5% higher than the 10-year quarterly and 17% greater than the five-year quarterly average. Total net inflows for the year reached $68.5 billion, the second highest level since 2014. Breaking down Canada’s FDI numbers In what has become a welcome trend over the past few quarters, global companies are proceeding with significant reinvestment into the country. By category, Reinvested Earnings accounted for no less than 77.2% of all flows, by far the largest portion. At $13.3 billion, total reinvested earnings are up 11% over last quarter. This result signals that global companies continue to demonstrate long-term faith in the Canadian economy. Mergers and Acquisitions was the second largest by investment type, comprising $5.8 billion of net FDI inflows in the quarter. Top sources of FDI Almost 75% of FDI inflows came from two countries: the United States (44.4%) and the United Kingdom (30.1%) together account for 74.4% of all Q4 inflows. The United States’ share of overall FDI increased by nearly 20% in Q4 2022 after a decline between the second and third quarters. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom outperformed its historical averages, recording its second highest quarter for FDI in the last decade at $5.2 billion. Investment from the U.K. was 367% higher than its five-year average and 728% higher than its 10-year average for this quarter. Leading industries seeing fdi strength in q4 In terms of sectors, four of them accounted for the bulk of FDI inflows this quarter. Finance and Insurance, after a dip last quarter, came back to the top spot this quarter with $4.8 billion, followed by Trade and Transportation ($4.3 billion), Manufacturing ($3.9 billion), and Energy and Mining ($3.2 billion). On the right path Overall, the numbers from Q4 experienced a decrease of 5.6% from Q3 2022 levels. Yet the numbers are still higher than Q2 2022 by 14.3%, and Canada continues to outperform 5- and 10-year historic averages. For Canadians, this should be further reassurance that our country – with its strong fundamentals – remains an attractive place for global companies to invest, therefore continuing to provide growth and innovation opportunities to communities across the country. For Invest in Canada, seeing these numbers reinforces the importance of attracting growth-minded global companies and helping them achieve success in communities across Canada.

Developing systems and supports" As for what Dal is trying to achieve with AI, that’s a conversation with Dr. Blouin right at its centre. For the next couple of years, a portion of his time will be spent consulting with staff and faculty, answering their questions and helping the university develop policies and guidelines with respect to the use of AI and machine-learning systems in the classroom, in research and in administrative work. “AI is not really a technology question — it’s more a people question,” explains Dr. Blouin. “Where is it appropriate or ethical to delegate automation or decision-making to algorithms and software systems — and where is it not? Especially within a university, a place where we disseminate knowledge, it’s important that we empower everyone to be part of that conversation.” Dr. Blouin already hosted meetings and delivered presentations with many Faculties and faculty councils on the subject, with more to come. His initial focus is on putting together a guidance document for fall courses on how these AI tools (such as large-language models) should be considered. “People want to know the boundaries of what they can and can’t do, and September is coming soon for faculty who may be looking to adjust their course plans or their syllabus,” he says. “The idea is a mix of pedagogical support and guidance-level advice — a working document that gets folks talking about it and feeling like they can start to get engaged in the subject.” Review: Working draft: Guiding principles for large-language models - 2023-24 academic year [PDF] Longer term, it’s about helping Dal prepare itself for an AI-informed digital future in which the pace of change is accelerating. Dr. Blouin wants to ensure the university isn’t caught off-guard by new developments but, instead, has the processes and people in place to carefully consider opportunities and challenges as they emerge. Most importantly, that we get better at coming together and make nuanced decisions in a multi-disciplinary and collaborative manner. The human element While the term “AI” is still perhaps best known for its sci-fi context in popular fiction like Terminator or The Matrix, its current application isn’t about artificial consciousness akin to actual human thinking. It’s about computer processes that consider massive amounts of data, whether words or numbers, to perform certain tasks very quickly. What makes it seem “intelligent,” though, is that the tasks being performed have, traditionally, been distinctly in the human domain such as writing complex text in particular styles or creating realistic-looking images. Through AI tools, computer software can now perform these functions — and can do so at a much higher quality level than ever before. Scary stuff? It can seem that way. “The first time someone uses a tool like Chat GPT it can be pretty overwhelming,” says Dr. Blouin, referring to the text-generating software developed by OpenAI that, since its launch just seven months ago, has become the standard-bearer for what modern AI can do. “These systems designed to generate language exercise quite a bit of analytical skills, and that’s disturbing, because we thought we [as humans] had a monopoly on that.” But these sorts of big-data systems can also be incredibly helpful. They work so fast, and on such a huge scale, that they can accomplish easily automatable tasks or processes that take up significant amounts of time — particularly ones that don’t require or benefit from creativity and analysis. Dr. Blouin cites an example of being asked to summarize a 90-page proposal: a large language tool can review that and provide back bullet points in seconds, versus taking hours to read through it and take notes. “It gives me the ability to scan so much more information more quickly,” he explains. “But we should never make critical decisions based on that work alone.”

How a controversial US drug policy could be harming cancer patients worldwide: In August 2021, Amol Akhade, an oncologist at Nair Medical Hospital in Mumbai, India, received an e-mail from the Swiss drug manufacturer Roche recommending the use of a drug named atezolizumab to treat a specific kind of breast cancer. Akhade was surprised. That month, Roche had withdrawn the drug for this purpose in the United States (although it is still approved to treat other kinds of cancer). For the type of breast cancer in question — known as triple-negative because it lacks three key protein markers — atezolizumab was made available in 2019 through the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Accelerated Approval Program. Accelerated approval is a fast-track process designed to place desperately needed drugs in the hands of patients quicker than is possible with conventional drug approval. But a follow-up study found that atezolizumab made little difference to tumour growth, and that people who received it were less likely to survive up to two years after treatment than were those not taking it1. When the FDA received these data in 2021, it indicated that accelerated approval was no longer appropriate, and Roche withdrew the drug for this form of breast cancer. The same thing happened with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), based in Amsterdam, but not everywhere else. In India, for example, where the drug was still approved for triple-negative breast cancer, Roche continued to promote the treatment until at least September, a fact that Akhade says he found “quite shocking”. “It’s not like patients with triple-negative breast cancer are different in the United States and outside,” he says. “We cannot have such differential treatment.” When asked about its responsibility to patients, Genentech, the Roche subsidiary in San Francisco, California, that developed atezolizumab, said that the drug is still approved in 100 countries for triple-negative breast cancer. “All of our medicines strictly adhere to the regulatory and promotional requirements of all local healthcare authorities,” said an e-mail from the company. Accelerated approvals in the United States are granted on the basis of clinical studies that suggest a health benefit without necessarily demonstrating it fully. The process prioritizes speed over certainty, and it requires companies to complete follow-up studies to confirm a treatment’s benefits. This is a “very reasonable compromise”, says bioethicist Holly Fernandez Lynch at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, “so long as we can get the confirmatory evidence quickly and reliably”. But there are complications that have made the programme controversial. Companies don’t always conduct studies in a timely manner, and the FDA hasn’t always been great about enforcing them. Researchers have noted that the median time to withdrawal for a drug that fails to hold up in confirmatory studies is four years2; sometimes it takes decades. And some high-profile accelerated approvals have raised eyebrows. Experts worry that the evidence used to support the approval of the Alzheimer’s disease drug aducanumab was insufficient; three FDA advisers resigned in protest. Other specialists have complained that the process allows companies to market expensive drugs for rare childhood diseases to desperate parents without sufficient evidence. There are currently nearly 200 cancer treatments approved through this pathway. Follow-up studies have led to the withdrawal of 26, and 68 are still awaiting confirmatory evidence (see ‘Cancer drugs on the go’). A lot of prescriptions can be made in the time between a drug’s accelerated approval and the publication of follow-up results. If those results are negative, the drug can still be prescribed to many people before its eventual withdrawal, and even afterwards — particularly when professional medical bodies recommend its use. And accelerated approvals have an effect beyond US borders, thanks to the fact that many countries use FDA decisions to guide their own regulatory policies. At the heart of the problem, says Lynch, is a failure of communication — both in the outcomes of follow-up studies and the nature of accelerated approval itself. “Clinicians and patients often view FDA approval as an on–off switch — either a drug is approved or it’s not,” she says. But it’s not that simple.

Resting on a long metal table and surrounded by more than a dozen students lay a species that has captivated researchers and the public alike for generations, but in many respects remains a scientific mystery. In a Dalhousie lab, about 40 people gathered to witness a necropsy on a young great white shark that was found on a beach near Parrsboro, N.S., at the end of June. The discovery gave students in the Seaside Summer Shark Course an exceptionally rare opportunity to see up close one of the ocean's most endangered and mythic creatures, while helping in the search for clues as to what led to its death. "It is so fascinating to be able to see it and be in this room with all of these amazing experts doing their thing," says Emma Martin, a fourth-year marine biology student who was drawn to Dal from Ontario because of the Biology and Conservation of Sharks, Skates and Rays class. "I've never seen a great white in person before and it's so cool to see what the anthropogenic causes of death are and what we can do about it. This is one of the main reasons I came to Dal." The shark — a 2.76-metre male estimated to be about seven years old — was retrieved by the Marine Animal Response Society (MARS), a charitable conservation group that works to protect marine species through education, research and responding to reports of dead or distressed marine animals. Tonya Wimmer, the group's executive director and a graduate of Dalhousie's Marine Biology program, received a call on June 24 about the shark and, with the support of scientists from the University of Windsor, were able to collect the endangered species under their Species at Risk Act permit. MARS then arranged to do the necropsy for the Dal shark class with the support of Chris Harvey-Clark, Dal's veterinarian and one of the course's instructors. For more than two hours, the team carefully dismembered the animal and checked it for any indications of the cause of death, while also giving students a highly detailed view of the shark's anatomy. They were able to hold the heart, help dissect certain organs, get an inside view of the liver, check the pancreas, spleen and thyroid, and see the thumb-sized recession that holds the brain. The shark's stomach — distended and full— also disgorged a small harbour porpoise that was bitten into large, identifiable and mostly intact pieces. "To have hands-on experience with a very endangered animal is really awesome — it's such a large specimen, so we get to see so much," said Adam Bouma, who is entering his fourth year in in marine biology and came to Dal from Belleville, Ont., largely for the shark course. "This will give me a better understanding and will help with job interviews because I now have experience with this. I have seen a great white shark cut open — not many people in undergraduate studies would get to do this. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!" It will also be an important resource for researchers from various organizations who were given dozens of tissue samples to study for insights into shark health and other issues since they don't often have the chance to examine great whites post-mortem. In an unusual occurrence, two white sharks were also reported to MARS when they washed up in the region last fall and were necropsied, but the causes of death have not yet been determined. Before that, it would be more typical for researchers to hear of a dead white shark every five years or so. Manuel Dureuil, one of the course instructors, has studied various sharks for years including in areas off South and West Africa, but this was the first time he witnessed a great white necropsy. "We are doing something that even not too many shark researchers would be able to participate in, so I'm just glad the students get a chance to see this up close," he said, watching as Dr. Harvey-Clark guided the class through the dissection organ by organ. "This is the entire motivation of why we are doing this -- to give 18 super interested young, up-and-coming marine biologists this once-in-a-lifetime experience. It also connects real hands-on science to the sharks." Wimmer, who did her Master of Biology at Dal, says the opportunity to witness such a necropsy could be the spark that leads some students to pursue certain marine studies. "For many people, there can be this one moment in their academic career where they go, 'Oh that — that's what I'm really interested in,'" she says. "It doesn't surprise me at all that there are so many students who come to Dalhousie because of the opportunity to do something like this, especially for a university that has such an ocean lean to it to also have these field courses is huge. It really does enhance the learning experience when you get to do these hands-on things."

Halifax-based space startup Galaxia Mission Systems will receive $1.7 million from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The funds will help Galaxia build and launch the first two of its intelligent nanosatellites into orbit — part of Atlantic Canada’s first commercial satellite ‘constellation.’ Galaxia, a space computation company, was founded in 2020 by Arad Gharagozli (BEng’20) and is developing technology that allows groups of satellites to communicate more effectively and efficiently using edge computing. (With edge computing, data is stored closer to its source, which allows the data to be collected and processed faster and use less bandwidth as compared to cloud computing.) Galaxia’s shoebox-sized nanosatellites, each weighing less than 10 kilograms, will be used to observe Earth in a variety of ways, according to the company’s website, from infrastructure monitoring to maritime security or processing time-sensitive intelligence during harsh weather. Gharagozli, who is both CEO of Galaxia and founder of the Dalhousie Space Systems Lab, is thrilled with the funding. “As you can imagine, space industry is one of the most expensive industries to grow in,” he says. “The up-front capital required to bring a concept into reality is high, and [the] associated risk is even higher. CSA’s funding will enable us to de-risk our ground-breaking technology and demonstrate its capabilities in space.” But most importantly, he explains, it shows that Galaxia’s vision dovetails with the Canadian Space Agency’s. (The two agencies are no strangers to one another, and last year Gharagozli and Tony Pellerin of the CSA co-presented an Open Dialogue Live lecture at Dalhousie called The Space Race of the 21st Century.) This isn’t the first time Gharagozli has broken new ground. In December of 2022, he and several students with the Dalhousie Space Systems Lab built and launched LORIS (Low Orbit Reconnaissance and Imagery Satellite), the first satellite ever designed in Atlantic Canada, from NASA in Houston, TX. It will remain in orbit, being studied by and sending images to Gharagozli and his team, until approximately December 2023. “LORIS has been an exceptional learning opportunity on so many levels,” Gharagozli says. “LORIS carried several high-tech systems that were all designed and manufactured here in Nova Scotia and were tested in space.” LORIS was built from scratch during a pandemic, with limited resources and a continuous turnover of staff and volunteers, says Gharagozli. “I would like to thank Dr. Kevin Plucknett, the principal investigator (PI) of the LORIS mission for his leadership. His continued support of the DSS led to the success of this mission and further helped me to establish GALAXIA at its early stages.” It ended up being a symbol of what a united vision can accomplish when people focus on a common goal. “I can say with confidence it is by far one of the most daring and ambitious undertakings that we have done at Dalhousie, [and it] cleared a path for a whole new industry to blossom in our region.”

After 50 years of service in the Faculty of Health, Dr. Jean Hughes is most excited by how much the School of Nursing has grown. When she started working at Dal, the school’s only program offering was the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN). Today, the school offers a bachelor’s program, three master’s programs, and one PhD program. “When I look around in our school, we’ve got so many areas of research that students can study, it’s totally different now,” she says. Dr. Hughes began teaching at Dal a few years after graduating from the Faculty of Health’s BScN program. She remained a faculty member in the Faculty throughout the rest of her post-secondary education, including a Master’s in Psychiatric Nursing at Boston University and a PhD in Nursing at McGill University. Recommended reading -- Milestones worth marking: Dal celebrates long service awards for 2021 and 2022 As Dal’s School of Nursing grew, Dr. Hughes worked to create various interprofessional education (IPE) opportunities for students across the Faculty of Health. Long before the Collaborative Health Education Building (CHEB) was constructed, Dr. Hughes and various faculty members created videotapes demonstrating collaborative patient-centered and interprofessional interactions for students. They equipped trained actors to perform different scenarios, including mental health dilemmas, student/faculty conflicts, grieving, anger, job interviews, post-abortion home visits with patients, and more. To help ensure that Faculty of Health students learn the strengths of different health disciplines, Dr. Hughes is one of the supervisors in the interprofessional education programs involving students from the Faculty of Health, medicine, and dentistry. These collaborations focus on a range of health concerns and aid students to develop patient-centered interactions and empathy skills along with enhanced understandings of what each discipline offers, ultimately aiding them in future professional interactions. “It’s not until you work together that you start to realize the different strengths of your own, and other, disciplines. We need to be more open-minded and holistic in our approach to care,” she says. Recommended reading: Largest ever gift to Dal's Faculty of Health aims to improve access to quality care Despite her satisfaction at seeing more mental health education being integrated into core BScN curriculums across the country, Dr. Hughes believes that master’s-level nursing programs need to incorporate more mental health education than what is currently being offered. To remedy this, she has recently developed a program with five master’s-level nursing courses in collaboration with Charlene Murphy, manager of Rural Services and Community Supports — Mental Health and Addictions — Eastern Zone at Nova Scotia Health Authority. While the program is still going through the approval process, Dr. Hughes will be teaching one course during this upcoming winter semester. “Dr. Jean Hughes’ positive outlook and support for faculty and students is infectious. Numerous graduate students have benefited from her supervision, to complete their own research that has also impacted the health care system,” says Dr. Megan Aston, professor in the School of Nursing, associate director for Research and International Affairs and director of the Centre for Transformative Nursing and Health Research (CTNHR).

From Bohdana Bila's perspective, international research experience is more than just an add-on to her academic experience. For the Ukrainian student, it's essential. “We need to understand that people in Ukraine, especially those who study there, need help from supervisors and teachers all around the world to be able to satisfy their dreams in a practical way,” says Bohdana. Bohdana is a summer research intern working with Dr. Richard Price and his team at Dalhousie's Faculty of Dentistry to research differences in dental curing lights. Dr. Price is a leading researcher on dental curing lights and a professor in the Department of Dental Clinical Sciences and School of Biomedical Engineering. Following her graduation from dental school in Ukraine, Bohdana began her master’s degree and decided to seek research opportunities abroad. Her friend, Yaryna Tylchak, informed Bohdana that Dr. Price was looking for a summer intern. After Bohdana expressed her interest in the opportunity, Dr. Price offered Bohdana the internship and successfully applied for funding through Mitacs Globalink and Research Nova Scotia’s Ukrainian Emergency Research Support Program. “I’m very appreciative of the support from Dr. Price, the people in the lab, Research Nova Scotia, and Mitacs because this is a great opportunity to grow,” explains Bohdana. “For me, it’s really important to make not only an impact on science, but also impact to the practical work for the people who are going to use it.” Dentists use curing lights every day in their offices to cure adhesives, harden white fillings, cement crowns, and bond brackets onto teeth. An estimated 800 million fillings that required the use of a curing light were placed in 2014. These fillings need a good curing light to prevent inadequate polymerization and premature failure. This internship opportunity has allowed Bohdana to see and test the wide range of curing lights available in Dr. Price’s laboratory and to learn how to effectively plan and implement a research project. Bohdana has seen first-hand that not all curing lights are the same and they produce different results. Surprisingly, most dentists are unaware of the tremendous differences between curing lights, and how this can have a significant impact on how the filling material, cements, and resins are cured in the mouth. The results from a survey Bohdana conducted in Ukraine showed that most dentists believe all curing lights are equal and often make purchasing decisions based on useability, brand and marketing, cost, and the warranty period. Only two to three per cent of respondents said they look at the irradiance or the power, the emission spectrum (colour of light emitted), and beam profile (uniformity) of the curing lights. Dr. Price reports that this result doesn’t surprise him because every study published has shown that most dentists know very little about curing lights. Research Nova Scotia’s Ukrainian Emergency Research Support Program has supported Bohdana’s three month stay in Nova Scotia and has helped fund the equipment she needs to conduct her research. “We implemented the Ukrainian Emergency Research Support Program to support Ukrainian researchers’ work while they are in Nova Scotia. This project not only supports a Ukrainian researcher; it is producing important research results,” says Stefan Leslie, CEO of Research Nova Scotia. “Bohdana’s research has the potential to inform better dental practices and improve patient outcomes in Nova Scotia, Ukraine, and beyond.” Working with Dr. Price, she has learned how to measure the output from lights, analyze their differences, and test outcomes. Dr. Price and Bohdana plan on submitting at least one article for publication based on her work in Canada. On her way back to Ukraine, Dr. Price has arranged for her to visit a major dental company, Ultradent, in the United States where she will present her research results. She will then return home to Ukraine to complete her master’s program and she hopes to submit another paper. Bohdana is looking forward to bringing her research findings back to Ukraine and to share her work at student dental conferences because she already has a lot of experience in organizing such events. “These three months here in Canada, at Dalhousie with Dr. Price, is a great opportunity to grow professionally and to bring greater investments to the industry when I go back to Ukraine,” explains Bohdana. “In Ukraine, it doesn’t matter if you are a scientist, a student, or a worker; everything you do, every day, you do for a better future.”

Kelly Lepo likes to joke that she’s a real-life Lisa Simpson. Like the famous cartoon character known for her intellect and activism, the alumna of the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Arts & Science is a self-proclaimed “nerd” who will share her love of science with anyone who will listen. “I love blowing people’s minds,” says Lepo, who earned her PhD from the David A. Dunlap department of astronomy and astrophysics in 2015 and is now an education and outreach scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. Lepo supports the James Webb Space Telescope by communicating the observatory’s discoveries to the world. She works at the same institute that oversees the famous spacecraft’s systems, schedules telescope time for scientists and records data. Lepo says U of T was the perfect place to hone her public outreach skills as a TA and receive media exposure as a trusted expert in Canada’s largest astronomy department. She also learned how to educate large audiences and communicate complex theories about the universe. “It’s an extraordinary experience learning from some of the top astronomers in a prestigious, yet nurturing environment,” says Lepo. “I remember the first time I landed in Toronto and it all sunk in that I was at one of the top universities in the world.” During her PhD research, Lepo investigated stars that will explode as one type of supernovae to determine whether they were caused by two white dwarf stars colliding, or one star transferring its mass to another. She directed telescope operators in Chile and Australia to gather data from thousands of stars in the Small Megellanic Cloud, a tiny galaxy orbiting the Milky Way. In the end, she couldn’t find proof of supernovae caused by mass transfer, but her work was an important contribution to research in the field. “In other studies, astronomers have used these supernovae to figure out the expansion history of the universe. They discovered our universe is not only expanding, but also accelerating in this expansion,” Lepo says. “Eventually, all galaxies are going to be so far away from each other that we're all going to be living in island universes.” Her PhD adviser, Professor Marten van Kerkwijk, says Lepo was an efficient and driven astronomer. “She has ample reason to be proud of her research,” says van Kerkwijk. “And I always appreciated the work she did while completing her PhD.” In 2013, Lepo was a key organizer of the first ever West African International Summer School for Young Astronomers, a program partly sponsored by the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA). Lepo also cultivated her reputation as a trusted astronomy voice amid media coverage of the ancient Mayans' doomsday prophecy of 2012. Lepo debunked myths about killer solar flares and mysterious runaway planets on a collision course with Earth. The experience complemented her TA duties in an Arts & Science class on the apocalypse, which took an interdisciplinary approach. “We had someone from astronomy, someone from English and someone from sociology collaboratively teaching the course,” says Lepo. “That was really interesting to see how you could approach the same topic across several subjects.” For her achievements inside and outside the classroom, Lepo won the Fieldus Award in 2014, given to one graduate student each year for excellence in leadership, teaching and research. After graduation, Lepo taught physics at Gonzaga University before becoming the first co-ordinator of the McGill Space Institute at McGill University. But she always ties her passion for public outreach back to U of T. “One of my favourite memories is being in the middle of the St. George campus with a big inflatable sun and trying to get people to look at the sun safely through some solar telescopes; we must have come off as some kind of sun cult,” Lepo recalls. “We explained to one person that the sun was much larger than the moon and they honestly had no idea, and this completely blew their mind. Those were the moments I really loved.”

The redevelopment of Toronto’s downtown Regent Park neighbourhood has won praise from some observers for taking a neglected housing project and turning it into a successful mixed-income area with impressive public amenities. But the ongoing $1.5-billion redevelopment has also disrupted lives, suffered major financial and political difficulties and now faces mixed reviews from the very residents it was designed to help. “There continues to be contention around whether or not this redevelopment was better or worse for the community,” says Shauna Brail, an associate professor and the director of the Institute for Management & Innovation at the University of Toronto Mississauga. “I am on the side that says that Regent Park today is an improved neighbourhood beyond what it was in 1999, or in 2006,” she says. Yet, she acknowledges the project has faced a host of problems since it was first proposed and agrees it hasn’t done everything it set out to do. Brail is an economic geographer and urban planner interested in how economic, social and cultural change transforms cities. She’s been studying the Regent Park redevelopment since the project broke ground in 2006. Along with Toronto journalist and U of T alumnus John Lorinc, she recently published an examination of the project in the Journal of Planning Education and Research. Regent Park was originally built as a public housing in the late 1940s, with 2,083 subsidized units on 69 acres. By the 1990s, the housing was in poor repair and the neighbourhood was experiencing problems with crime and stigma. At the same time, the federal government had decreased the funding available for social housing. Land values, though, had gone up. The Toronto Community Housing Corp. (TCHC) decided to pay for redevelopment through “financialization” – building and selling some housing at market prices and using the profits to finance new subsidized housing. The vision was to create a mixed-income neighbourhood with a strong sense of community and amenities shared by everyone. Existing tenants were relocated during reconstruction, but were offered a right to return – and so far about half have come back. One of the things Brail was interested in was how low-income community residents would be able to influence the redevelopment process. She says they empowered themselves, giving input on planning and insisting that money and resources be dedicated to the community for things like parks, social centres, jobs and training. But the community is also divided on the outcomes so far, she says. “There are some who say, without a doubt, this is better,” Brail says. “On the other side is the narrative of destruction of community – the sense that this is a very patronizing kind of approach to redeveloping public housing.” In their paper, Brail and Lorinc outline the political, financial and social complications of the nearly 20-year-long project, which has been delayed by a number of factors, including the election of the late mayor Rob Ford and his promise to slash spending. Redevelopment is now five to eight years behind schedule, with two of five phases unfinished. Brail says she’s interested in how the rising value of downtown real estate changed how planners thought about public housing: Rather than relying on public funding, the projects could finance themselves. Financialization, however, didn’t cover the full cost of Regent Park’s redevelopment. The three levels of government have collectively kicked in about $500 million so far. One of the major lessons of the project is that redevelopment doesn’t come free, Brail says. “The financialized model on its own is not sufficient. Governments still need to continue to think through just how to fund public housing, and they need to continue to be pushed to do that.”

Nuclear medicine was first developed in the 1950s as a cancer treatment before shifting to primarily being used as a diagnostic tool, using tiny amounts of radioactive substances to image different parts of the body. Now, nearly three quarters of a century later, the field is coming full circle as researchers like Raymond Reilly, a professor in the University of Toronto’s Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, explore options for new cancer therapies. Reilly is a leader in developing radiopharmaceuticals that combine radioactive isotopes with highly specific targeting agents to precisely deliver radiation to tumours. His work focuses specifically on radiopharmaceuticals that have “theranostic” properties – useful for both the imaging and treatment of cancer. “Radiopharmaceuticals are unique in that you can use the radiopharmaceutical for diagnostic imaging purposes, but you can also use the same agent, sometimes at a higher dose or labelled with a different radioisotope, to treat the cancer,” says Reilly. “And you can then use that same radiopharmaceutical to image the patient again after treatment to see if that patient responded to the treatment.” Cancer researchers and pharmaceutical companies have become more interested in the field after two radiopharmaceuticals  were developed and used to successfully treat neuroendocrine cancer and prostate cancer. “These are the vanguard or leading edge of this type of radiopharmaceuticals, but they are really  just the tip of the iceberg of what is possible with radiopharmaceuticals,” says Reilly. “Radiopharmaceuticals used to be a specialized area of medical research with a small group of  dedicated scientists, but it’s starting to emerge as a new cancer treatment that could overcome resistance to other treatments.” However, Reilly explains that the current availability of  radioisotopes suitable for cancer therapy is extremely limited. The project is led by François Bénard, an internationally recognized leader in nuclear medicine, at the BC Cancer Agency, and includes 16 co-investigators across Canada,  including Reilly, who is the sole U of T co-investigator on the project. The team includes researchers at TRIUMF, Canada’s world-leading particle accelerator centre in British Columbia that  creates medical isotopes, chemists who will study ways of attaching the isotopes to targeting agents and clinical trials specialists who will study the radiopharmaceuticals for the first time  in patients. Health economists on the team will try to understand how best to implement the radiopharmaceuticals into Canada’s health-care system. Reilly is leading one component of the research that aims to develop radiopharmaceuticals to image and treat recurrence of head and neck cancer. His team is collaborating with researchers at University Health Network to test the new radiopharmaceuticals in preclinical models and find ways to detect recurrence early so that it can be effectively treated with radiopharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceuticals have potential to treat breast and brain cancers In addition to the work being done through the NFRF project, Reilly and his team have made significant advances with other radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. For example, Reilly’s team developed a radiolabelled version of the breast cancer drug Herceptin, which was used in a small clinical trial that examined its treatment for brain metastases of breast cancer. In the trial, the researchers studied whether high-intensity focused ultrasound would allow Herceptin to more effectively cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumour. Reilly’s radiopharmaceutical was key to imaging if – and where – the drug accumulated in the brain. His team has also been working on developing radiation nanomedicines, which combine radiopharmaceuticals and nanotechnology. They have recently developed radiolabelled gold nanoparticles that, in preclinical models, are able to precisely deliver radioisotopes to brain tumour cells and kill them without harming normal tissue. They have had promising results with these first-generation radiolabelled nanomedicines and are continuing to develop and improve them. As the field grows from a niche specialty to a more widely studied potential cancer treatment, Reilly says he is excited about the potential for radiopharmaceuticals to have a significant impact in improving patient outcomes. “One of the transformations that has emerged in recent years is a tremendous resurgence of interest in radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment – not just for imaging – and now combining them into this theranostic concept,” says Reilly.

Tune into a recent Hart House Stories podcast and you’ll hear students, educators and a social worker talk about the climate crisis. What should governments, corporations and individuals do? With all the alarming news, how do we manage our anxiety? The host is energetic and passionate. The group’s opinions are heartfelt. The person who wrote, produced, interviewed and made the music for the episode – Elijah Miller – is justifiably proud. And Miller is not a U of T professor, administrator or undergrad, but a Grade 12 student. “I came up with questions, edited – everything,” says Miller, who got the opportunity through a program called Support, Engage, Experience U of T – or “SEE U of T” – which gives youth from historically under-represented communities a sense of what university is like. “It was super-awesome.” Developed with the Toronto District School Board, and run by Woodsworth College since 2019, the program – which has recently expanded to cover all three campuses – invites local Grade 11 and 12 students to complete a first-year U of T course at no charge. Participants also do a co-op placement, receive mentoring from a senior-year undergrad and explore the university’s facilities and services. In the process, they earn two high school co-op credits plus a half-credit toward a university degree. “This is about removing barriers that are created as a result of structural and historical inequities and creating pathways to post-secondary education,” says Ann Lopez, U of T’s provostial advisor on access programs. “Not only does U of T want to attract students who are traditionally under-represented, but we want them to see the university as a place where they belong.” (Lopez collaborated on the creation of the SEE U of T concept with Woodsworth’s then-assistant principal and registrar, Cheryl Shook, and principals and staff at the participating high schools, Runnymede Collegiate Institute and Downsview Secondary School.) U of T has recently intensified efforts to create a more welcoming environment for Black students. In 2020, the university established the U of T Institutional Anti-Black Racism Task Force, whose report the following year made 56 recommendations to promote Black inclusion and excellence across the tri-campus community. The university has accepted all of the recommendations and implemented many of them; it continues to work on others. Participants in “SEE U of T” can choose from up to 16 courses. For help with assignments, they can turn not only to their course instructor and teaching assistant, but also to an academic advisor dedicated to their cohort and a learning strategist at Woodsworth’s Academic Writing Centre. Co-op placement options are available at up to 24 academic and administrative sites. U of T covers tuition fees and books, and the school board typically provides student supports such as bus tickets and meals. The program “plays an important role in levelling the playing field for learning opportunities” and “contributes to a more inclusive society,” says Natasha Jesenak, director of access programs and registrarial services at Woodsworth. To date, more than 50 high schoolers across three cohorts have taken part. Fewer participated during the pandemic when activities moved mostly online, but the program will be fully in-person this fall. U of T Mississauga piloted its own version of “SEE U of T” this past fall in partnership with the Peel District School Board and its two participating schools, Fletcher’s Meadow Secondary School and Meadowvale Secondary School. “SEE UTM” offers a course about critical thinking in science and technology. The students also pick up some valuable life skills. “You learn how to manage your workload, and how to communicate if you’re falling behind,” says Grade 12 participant Abby-Gayle Isadora Allen. “I learned so much that I can apply to my future.” Like St. George, UTM offered workshops in areas such as discovering your strengths, and personal finance. Participants were offered 20 hours of one-on-one mentorship by an undergrad. Mentor Tobi Mohammed, who was also the teaching assistant for the science and technology course, helped her mentees with skills such as time management, creating a LinkedIn profile and applying to university. “We talked about their ambitions and goals, their personal struggles – we talked about everything,” says Mohammed, a fourth-year student in biology for health sciences. As someone who is Black, she adds, “I wish I’d had something like this in first year.”

Often, behind every great scientist is … another great scientist. So, when Christina Guzzo was finishing her PhD and needed a mentor to further her training, she decided to seek out the best. “I wanted to experience what it’s like to be on the cutting edge,” she says. “Working with Anthony Fauci’s research team was my goal.” Before Fauci became the public face of the U.S. government’s COVID-19 response, he led the world-renowned HIV research centre at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Guzzo, whose research focused on HIV infection, approached him at an AIDS conference. Since Guzzo already had a solid body of published research, Fauci agreed to interview her for one of the research centre’s fiercely competitive post-doctoral positions. He was immediately struck by her intelligence, energy and commitment. Fauci says today, “Right from the very beginning, you get the impression that besides being extremely bright, Christina has a sense of purpose – to do good things with the science, with the ultimate purpose of alleviating suffering and death.” He hired her. Guzzo hit the ground running, quickly acclimating to the intense pace and long hours of the lab and furthering HIV research over the next five years. “It was always clear that she wanted to return to Canada,” Fauci says, “but I can tell you that if she’d wanted to stay in my lab indefinitely, I would have welcomed that. She’s a productive, insightful, creative scientist.” And now she’s a mentor herself. Since leaving the National Institutes of Health in 2017, Guzzo, 38, has been running her own lab as a professor in the department of biological sciences at U of T Scarborough. “I see how pivotal mentorship can be in shaping opportunities for people entering the sciences,” she says, “particularly young women who may feel excluded or biased against, since I too went through those feelings. And still do.” While Guzzo encourages all her students to seek out mentors, she makes a point of telling her female students, “I believe in you” or “I know you can do it.” She says, “I feel like young women don’t often hear that others really believe in them, and it’s important for them to hear those words.” She volunteers for Sparking Science, a program designed to help high school girls learn about science and technology careers from female scientists, offering the kind of early mentorship Guzzo never had. And she’s open with her students about her need to take time off for family issues, so they too will feel comfortable taking time off when necessary. “You still need to work your butt off,” she says with a smile, “but it’s easy when you love your job.” Mentorship hasn’t always figured so prominently in Guzzo’s life. Throughout her high school and undergrad years, she had no science mentors. She almost didn’t become a scientist at all. She was going to be a basketball player. The child of blue-collar Italian immigrants who settled in Caledon, Ontario, northwest of Toronto, Christina was a teenage sports star and kids’ camp counsellor. While she had always thought science was cool, she was leaning toward varsity basketball. But as an undergrad at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, in the mid-2000s, she heard about a student-run charitable organization doing HIV-AIDS education for youth internationally. Travel, kids and science? For Guzzo, it was a perfect fit. For the next three summers she headed to Kenya, teaming up with local university students to prepare curricula on HIV and youth empowerment for schools in the massive informal settlements around Nairobi. She didn’t realize it at the time, but she was learning how to teach. Back at Queen’s, despite her new interest in HIV, Guzzo didn’t volunteer in a lab. “And then I met Katrina Gee.” Young and friendly, Gee was a newly hired professor in the department of microbiology and immunology. They met when Guzzo was presenting her self-directed undergrad thesis project. The two clicked, and Guzzo now had her first science mentor. Over the next five years, while Guzzo produced some significant research – she published five first-author scientific papers and six co-authored ones – Gee also taught her the importance of having fun along the way. Together, they celebrated not only the big accomplishments, such as an award, but the smaller things too, such as an experiment going right.

A unique collaboration between University of Toronto engineers and hospital physicians is pioneering the use of artificial intelligence – similar to an AI that helps detect earthquakes – to diagnose heart rhythm abnormalities at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children. The innovative approach, which combines specially trained AI with the expertise of SickKids clinicians, could lead to significantly better health outcomes for critically ill children by providing faster and more accurate diagnosis of heart problems, the researchers say, as well as easing demands on clinicians’ time. “This could help some of our most vulnerable patients, while also reducing stress on the health-care system,” says Mjaye Mazwi, a staff physician at SickKids and an associate professor at U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine. When the heart is functioning as it should, it beats to a regular rhythm – the familiar vertical spike followed by ripples that appear on a heart monitor. A heartbeat that is too fast, too slow or chaotic can cause severe complications and death. Almost one in three children admitted to an intensive care unit experience a heart rhythm anomaly; at SickKids this affects as many as 700 children a year. These patients require constant monitoring, which places a high demand on hospital staff who are typically caring for other patients at the same time. “The challenge is that clinicians cannot continuously monitor every bedside,” says Sebastian Goodfellow, an assistant professor in U of T’s department of civil and mineral engineering and a principal investigator at the Lassonde Institute of Mining. This can lead to a delay in detecting or diagnosing an abnormal heart rhythm, resulting in a worse outcome for the patient. He and Mazwi, who is SickKids’ director of translational engineering in critical-care medicine, are developing what they believe will be a game-changing solution. Prior to joining the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, Goodfellow worked at a mining startup where he helped build AI models to scan geological data for certain patterns. In 2017, he was invited to enter a “computing in cardiology” challenge with a team from Laussen Labs, a research group at SickKids. There, he met Mazwi, who was interested in using AI to detect heart arrhythmias and was looking for help with the complex challenge of deploying it in the hospital. Goodfellow’s experience made him a natural collaborator. The AI they are developing is being trained to recognize the warning signs of impending arrhythmia based on clinicians’ expertise and more than 10,000 electrocardiogram readings – a far greater number than even the most experienced clinicians would encounter during their career. Before being deployed with patients, the AI needs to be able to match or exceed the performance of a clinician, and accurately sound the alarm when one of these arrhythmia warning signs appears. “We want this AI to partner with the best of human intelligence in a kind of collaborative intelligence,” says Mazwi, who is also research co-lead at the Temerty Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research and Education in Medicine. “We don’t believe that AI will replace clinicians, but we do believe that clinicians who use AI will outperform and replace clinicians who do not.” The researchers are initially focusing on a specific type of irregular cardiac activity called Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia, or JET, that is especially tricky to detect because it involves subtle changes in the patient’s electrocardiogram. In those who have recently had corrective heart surgery, JET poses a significant risk of injury or death. Detecting and treating JET early reduces this risk, which is clearly crucial for the patient. It also helps shorten the patient’s hospital or ICU stay, benefiting the entire health-care system, says Mazwi. Eventually, the researchers hope to develop AI models for detecting every kind of heart rhythm anomaly. Although AI is making rapid inroads into many areas of life, including medicine, Mazwi says the process in health care is necessarily slower and more careful. An AI model must be tested and retested to ensure it will improve both patient outcomes and overall performance in the health-care system before it is used on actual patients. “We’re held to a much higher standard,” he says. “You don’t deploy an AI until you are perfectly sure it will provide gains over the current process.” The research team at U of T and SickKids is collaborating with clinicians and researchers at other pediatric hospitals in England, Israel and Australia to test the AI models being developed in Toronto. Their two goals: to ascertain if the models work as well on similar patient populations in other hospitals and to sow the seeds for expanding far beyond Canada.”

Anyone who has seen a tree stump will have noticed the rings in the wood and, at some point, learned that counting these rings can tell you the age of the tree. This unique growth not only tells us how long a tree stood, but it also holds clues to past weather patterns. Trevor Porter, a professor in the department of geography, geomatics and environment at U of T Mississauga, is tapping into this natural archive to create a detailed picture of how Canada’s climate has changed over the past 1,000 years. With a network of research sites that span the Yukon and Northwest Territories, his goal is to build a chronology that stretches back long before weather records such as thermometer readings were kept, and to better understand what a future, warmer Arctic may look like. Trees are sensitive to precipitation and temperature, which affect their annual growth. Porter, who is a paleoclimatologist, analyzes the individual rings, examining their width and the density of the wood and then subtracting the natural pattern of growth to see how the environment has changed. “What we learn from tree rings is valuable,” he says. While there are records that go back 10,000 years or more from other sources – ice cores, sediment and ground ice, for example – tree rings provide detailed, annual information that is exactly dated. One of Porter’s long-term aims is to create a comprehensive record from the region that goes back a millennium. So far, his team has managed 913 years. “I really want to push this farther back in time,” he says, which means looking for dead trees buried in lakes or mud deposits where the wood is preserved. Porter describes the process of reconstructing the past climate using tree rings – a field known as dendrochronology – as a painstaking exercise. Going back further in time requires matching the pattern in a sequence of rings from a dead tree with a section of rings of a living tree from the same geographic area. With a match, the dead tree can be accurately dated. “It’s a bit like solving a jigsaw puzzle,” he says. Researchers can determine the date of tree rings on dead tree samples with help from living trees, where the dates are known. By lining up rings on a dead tree with samples from living trees, researchers can compare the pattern of growth on the outer most layers of the dead tree. Once they find a match in the sequence, they can extend the tree ring chronology.

For many Canadians, climate change is nothing but bad news: wildfires, flooding, icebergs melting and heat waves. Worse still, for many, the solutions can seem more painful than the problem: drive or fly less while paying more for gas and energy. It’s no wonder then, that Canada’s progress on climate change is incremental at best. But recently, activists and progressive politicians have breathed new life into climate politics by proposing a Green New Deal: a massive mobilization of government resources to decarbonize society while providing workers in carbon-based industries with the services and support they need to prosper. This reframing of climate change solutions as a win-win, rather than a lose-lose, has gained traction with people of diverse interests – from politicians to labour union leaders to rabbis. Ideas related to the Green New Deal have been floating around for a decade or so, and centre on the idea that environmental problems are not just about “the environment.” They are about people too. As such, the environment is linked to problems of economic inequality and social injustice, for two reasons. First, families living in poverty, people of colour and Indigenous peoples suffer disproportionately from pollution and fossil fuel extraction. For example, in Canada, many Indigenous peoples have objected strenuously to the Trans Mountain Pipeline on the grounds that it could harm waterways and wildlife, disturb sacred sites and foul the land they seek to protect. Low-income communities are also more likely to suffer environmental harms. According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, one-quarter of Canada’s poorest live within one kilometre of a pollution-emitting facility. Second, linking climate with justice and equality – by creating more opportunities for people to earn a living wage and correcting the radical income inequality that has surged over the last few decades – can help build broad political coalitions to support aggressive action. In contrast to the U.S., where the Green New Deal is a resolution in the House of Representatives, there is no single Green New Deal for Canada. Instead, it is a patchwork of proposals coming from different corners. The NDP has crafted “A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs,” which calls for urgent action on climate change as well as the creation of 300,000 green jobs across the country. It promises other financial benefits such as reduced energy expenditures through efficiency upgrades and cheaper (and perhaps even free) public transport. However, the NDP plan is conspicuously silent on what to do about fossil fuel production beyond pledging to “support workers” so that “the changing economy works for them.” Finally, activists and civil society have their own proposals. In May 2019, more than 100 groups launched a Pact for a Green New Deal, which sets the ambitious goal of halving Canadian emissions in 11 years “while protecting cultural and biological diversity.” The centrepiece of Canadian climate policy is the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. While carbon pricing is central to the framework, it has proven controversial: Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney were quick to repeal carbon pricing laws once elected. And Premier Scott Moe will challenge its legality in Saskatchewan. Recent court rulings indicate that carbon pricing is here to stay, but in the meantime, it has become a political football. Moreover, Justin Trudeau has said that the price will be capped at $50 per tonne, which is too low to drive the kind of change we need. To meet Canada’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, we need to make a wholesale economic transition. The Green New Deal offers ideas for this transition that are both environmentally sustainable and economically and socially just. Federal policies are needed to help create new jobs for those who would be affected by closing the tar sands. These policies could take a variety of forms. Federal procurement policies could drive demand for carbon-neutral electricity and buildings, and the production and installation of the requisite technology. New standards for generating renewable electricity would create incentives to build more capacity. Investments in grid upgrades would also create more jobs. At the same time, tightening emissions regulations would slow the use of fossil fuels. Of course, not all workers can be retrained. In these cases, the federal government must be honest and generous. Buyouts will be needed, and pensions should be guaranteed. Provinces have neither the incentive nor the capital to implement such policies, so the federal government would have to step in.

Early in January, Jair Bolsonaro was sworn in as the president of Brazil. He ascended to the highest office of South America’s largest country through a visceral campaign that targeted political elites, minorities, women and members of the LGBTQ community, and used social media to rally support from far-right nationalists. On his first day in office, he issued a number of executive orders to restrict the rights of minority groups. With a few significant variations, Bolsonaro’s story is similar to Donald Trump’s in the U.S., Viktor Orbán’s in Hungary, Marine Le Pen’s in France, the Five Star Movement’s in Italy and Brexit. Protectionist, anti-immigrant nationalists are tearing down the post-Second World War consensus on the importance of pluralism and the free movement of goods and people. Around the world, liberal democratic values are in retreat. To understand why, we must look to the working and middle classes, who are concerned their jobs may be automated or moved to lower-cost countries. To calm these fears, nationalist politicians are offering to protect jobs with seemingly simple solutions such as trade barriers. 1 At the same time, they’re painting the political, business and media elites as puppets of foreign interests, reinforcing the idea that only they can protect the less-educated workers. Only they can protect citizens from the impacts of free trade and migration. 2 They stoke anxiety about migration 3– to the point that their anti-immigrant position is their defining feature. These nationalist leaders have become experts at getting this message out. Using largely anonymous platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, they craft posts that tap into the emotive power of nationalism – unique in its ability to mobilize people to act in constructive but also irrational and frightening ways. Nationalism is one of the few ideas, along with religion, that moves people to fight – and even die – on behalf of people they have never met. As part of a research project, a colleague and I read all of Trump’s tweets – more than 5,000 in total – during the 2016 election campaign. In almost half of them, he presents himself as the protector of “true Americans” against Mexican migrants, Muslims and political elites. In comparison, he tweeted about policy issues such as health care, taxes and the Supreme Court fewer than 100 times each. This strategy was central to his success: 57 per cent of white Americans voted for him. Beating back the rising forces of ethnic nationalism won’t be simple. It will require long-term, fundamental social and political changes and also short-term adjustments to how we participate in politics. We can start by reducing the anxieties of the working and middle classes through policies that bolster the social safety net, reduce inequality and help prepare and retrain workers for jobs in the information-based economy. Pilot studies testing the effects of a universal basic income show promise. These programs provide workers with a guaranteed level of income regardless of their employment, which allows them to withstand losing a job and gives them support to retrain for a new one. What continues to motivate support for Brexit is the view that the European Union doesn’t adequately represent the interests of the regular British citizen. A similar mistrust of government, or cynicism about politics, exists in many other countries. Advocates for immigration need to convey to the public how logical, managed and well-resourced selection and settlement policies benefit both migrants and the host society. In Canada, there’s broad support for immigration largely because of our long-standing points-based model and a commitment to language training for recent migrants. America and many European states face high volumes of refugees and irregular immigration. But there, too, a process that selects highly skilled migrants could help alleviate fears that they weaken the economy and could buy public support for a more generous immigration policy. Governments should hold social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter responsible for the content their users post, just as they do mainstream publishers and broadcasters. In other words, social media should be regulated. Some suggest that to defeat nationalism, we should partly embrace what nationalists are saying. Supporters of this approach call for protectionist economic policies, less immigration, and more programs aimed at boosting the national culture. 4 They believe we need to take what nationalists are saying seriously in order to effectively address the grievances of many majority groups around the world, including Trump’s “true Americans.”

In 1998, OpenText was in the business of Internet search when a small startup called Google came along. Below, Jenkins – at the time the company’s CEO – writes about how OpenText’s failure against Google allowed the company to “pivot” and become one of the world’s largest software and cloud companies. OpenText originally set out to be the primary search engine of the Internet and it failed. From a Canadian point of view that’s very important, because part of the dilemma we have in Canadian innovation, invention and competition is that we shy away from failure. If somebody fails, we avoid looking that person in the eye. It’s a stigma. OpenText’s stock price collapsed from $20 to $2 in less than six months. It was a very public failure. At the time, articles about the collapse of our business model and the abandonment of our search engine were appearing in various newspapers – not unlike the articles that have been published about the decline of BlackBerry, Nortel and Valeant. My friends in Waterloo, Ontario, my family, and other people I know in Canada lost large amounts of money on OpenText stock. When you take the garbage out to the end of your driveway, and realize that many of the homes you see belong to people who lost a good chunk of their money because of your failure, it’s very personal and very painful. What came out of that failure? OpenText turned to business-to-business applications, which was a less competitive market but no less lucrative than the public-facing business of search engines we moved out of. OpenText was far more profitable in the long run. However, if we had not failed with our first strategy, re-¬evaluated and pivoted when we did, we never would have realized this success. This is, I hope, the single most important learning: no matter what happens, you must stick it out, adapt, evaluate and pivot with confidence because, on your 131st try, it’s going to work. Successful entrepreneurs are actually serial failures. Thomas Edison is perhaps the greatest serial failure in the modern era – but we don’t think of him that way. We think of him as a successful entrepreneur and as a successful inventor. In fact, he failed time after time. He used his failures as opportunities to learn what didn’t work. Failures are part of the journey toward success. As Edison and so many other innovators have proven, to fail is not the worst thing that can happen. But Canadians are myopic about it. Canadian companies such as Nortel and Research in Motion have had very public collapses. So have many others. The reality is that failure is going on all the time, and it is part of the innovation process. At OpenText, we were fortunate to change direction in the nick of time. OpenText was able to take some of its resources, some of its money, and the technologies that it had built, repurpose them to a different market and a different application, and succeed. Our failure was only temporary, since the pivot proved to be the right decision. That would not become apparent, though, until many years later. OpenText began to grow in its new business and went on to be the market leader in designing and building software for corporate intranets and the cloud. Today, OpenText is one of the largest software and cloud companies in the world and never left its home in Waterloo. Today its headquarters for more than 12,000 people is located just a few steps away from where its first Internet search product, OpenText Index, was created in 1995.

On June 12, a Muslim man named Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people and injured 53 others in an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando, Florida. From Toronto, there was not much I could do except condemn the shooter. But what was meant to be a simple gesture on social media made me the target of hate from hundreds of Muslims around the world. Such is the life of an openly gay Muslim. “I’m sad you weren’t in the club in Orlando,” one man wrote in a tweet, adding at the end “Have a nice day” with a smiley. “Please get hit by a bus,” another said. “I’ll be among those to stone you to death,” one Muslim tweeted. “Please prepare for hell,” warned another politely. As an openly gay Muslim, I am terrified of the Muslim community. As a Muslim, I know that acts of terror do not reflect Islam. With more than 1.6 billion Muslims on this planet, I know the vast majority of them are non-violent and peaceful just like me. As a gay man, I find no comfort in this fact because I know firsthand that hatred of LGBTQ people runs rampant within the Muslim community. Muslims cannot claim that Islam is the Religion of Peace if it is the Religion of Homophobia. We cannot be both because to be the religion of homophobia means people die. Not just by the people that ISIS throws off the roofs of buildings, not just by people shot in cold blood by Muslims such as Omar Mateen, nor by the people hacked to death inside their homes. Muslims also kill people with the homophobia in their hearts and on their lips because that homophobia leads LGBTQ Muslims to hate themselves. This self-hate leads many to take their own lives. This is a truth that is all too familiar to me and nearly cost me my life. Growing up, I found it was easy to deny that I was gay. My immigrant parents did their best to raise their children in line with their traditional Bangladeshi Muslim values. Pork, alcohol, even (heterosexual) dating were all forbidden. In high school, I dismissed my lack of interest in girls as me being a good and obedient son. Moving out for the first time, to be an undergrad at the University of Toronto, I tried to bring those traditional Muslim values with me to the dorm. This included the homophobia I learned from the Muslim community. Moving onto campus was like entering the belly of the beast. Throughout the hallways were rainbow-coloured “positive space” stickers. I was disgusted. How could there be so many queers? Did they have no shame? Why did they have to be so open? What I did not know then, and what many Muslims still do not understand, is that being an LGBTQ person and being openly proud forces you to empathize. In the Muslim community, few people are brave enough to come out so most Muslims see LGBTQ issues as a distant “Western” problem. It’s easy to hate in the abstract. By being brought face-to-face with open and proud LGBTQ people, I had to choose between hate and love. I chose love. I chose love even when I did not love myself enough to accept that I was gay. I chose love because Allah has 99 names and bigotry, hate and homophobia are not among them – but love is. Many Muslims are proud of their racial and religious identity even though openly embracing this identity can lead us to be targets of racism and Islamophobia. What many Muslims don’t understand is that this same pride lives in the hearts of LGBTQ people even though we face homophobia, transphobia and biphobia. Omar Mateen’s act of terrorism shows us that being openly gay and proud can still cost us our lives. As a proud and openly gay Muslim, I know that I am a target within the Muslim community. Maybe one day it will cost me my life. But by being open and proud of who I am, Muslims are forced to choose. They must choose between loving me or hating me. If they choose love, they will see that both the gay community and the Muslim community have shared truths. Both believe that life is precious and both want to live in a world with tolerance.

Several years before I arrived at U of T for graduate school, I had left my hometown in Philadelphia and begun travelling the world: studying development projects in Sri Lanka, taking courses in classical history and archeology in Italy, teaching in England and making art in Portugal. Boastful of my sojourns, I placed pins on a broad world map marking each new destination that I had “conquered.” But I also became intrigued by the idea that this map wouldn’t exist if there hadn’t been bold explorers who first headed out into the unknown and recorded what they saw. Alex Jones, a classics professor I met when I arrived at U of T in 1988, must have sensed this curiosity when he told me: “The history of cartography – that’s the subject for you.” And so, during my studies at U of T’s Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, I had the opportunity to carry out several years of research on the history of maps and exploration in the medieval period. Early maps are pictures of lands and seas, but they are also pictures of how earlier civilizations perceived the world. They did so in ways often very different from us, building maps based on exploration but also on myth, hearsay, speculation. Some years after graduation, I tracked down a set of obscure early maps and texts owned by a private collector. These maps intrigued me because of their background. They had been brought to the U.S. by an Italian immigrant named Marcian F. Rossi, and were now held by one of his descendants. Rossi had traced his lineage in Italy back to an admiral who had known Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant who trekked the length of Asia between 1271 and 1295. The maps had been discussed in an article from the 1940s, but no detailed study had been done, so I seized the opportunity. Thus began years of investigation and analysis, including the arduous task of translating obscure bits of Latin, medieval Italian and even Chinese on the documents. The documents themselves, done in ink on vellum, recount a previously unknown history of the famous Polo. One text speaks of a “land of frost” and “sea lions,” and refers to the far reaches of northeast Asia, which is also what some of the maps apparently depict – a region not found in the traditional Polo narrative. This same text also speaks of a “remote peninsula washed by the seas, where the people, because of the extreme cold, live in caves…” Such descriptions, and some renderings on the maps themselves, are suggestive of early knowledge of the western shores of North America, some two centuries before Columbus. The documents also imply a charting of the northern Pacific Ocean and maybe even part of Alaska 500 years before the Russians first sent expeditions there. The quantity of the materials (some 14 maps and texts in all), and the number of connections within and among them, added to the intrigue of the case and the complexity of the investigation. With the recent publication of my book, The Mysteries of the Marco Polo Maps (2014), a much wider audience has the chance to understand the beauty and complexity of these and other maps, and the role that merchants and explorers such as Marco Polo had in expanding our knowledge of distant lands. I like to think that somehow my own travels – which, after graduate school, finally included several years in Asia – are an echo of Polo’s curiosity about the world beyond his humble origins.

I was raised in a somewhat religious family. My parents jumped around from church to church, trying to find one that fit; never staying at one for more than a couple of years. Every Sunday morning, my parents struggled to convince me to go. I’m not sure if this was because of my adolescent rebellious streak or my genuine dislike of church, or both. Either way, I grew up dismissing religion in general and, at times, even resenting it. Yet, I remained curious about those for whom religion is deeply important. I never thought that I would become a journalist who covers this topic. In 2008, I began my undergraduate degree at Trinity College. I took a course on religion and human rights that included material on the Dhammayietra – annual peace walks led by Cambodian Buddhist monks that began in 1992 as a means to restore order to a nation devastated by the Khmer Rouge. Learning about the Dhammayietra challenged my preconceived notions about religion and brought to light the complex forces behind religious belief and its powerful potential for cultivating peace in times of despair. After the course ended, I replaced my English major with one in religion and reconsidered my lifelong dream of going to law school. All I knew was that I wanted a career with some tie to religion, still unsure as to what exactly that would look like. In my final year, I interned at the Tony Blair Faith Foundation (a group that uses religion to combat extremism) assisting with Faiths Act, its international interfaith fellowship program. People from different faith and non-faith backgrounds worked in pairs on projects in their communities related to the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. While Mr. Blair has received much criticism, especially lately for his involvement in Middle East affairs and the News of the World phone hacking scandal, I’m still convinced that his aim to foster religion as a force for good is valuable. Inspired by the foundation’s work for human rights, I began my master’s degree in human rights at the London School of Economics in 2012, writing my dissertation on Christian efforts to combat human trafficking in the U.S., where there is a huge amount of attention and money directed at the issue, and an even greater debate around whether this actually solves the problem. In my field research I heard compelling and sometimes heart-wrenching stories from human trafficking survivors and people working at anti-human-trafficking groups. I was able to recount some of these stories in my final paper, but was unsatisfied with having to confine them to the realm of academia. I realized that journalism might be an ideal way to combine my religion research with my desire to reach a wider audience. Last May, I completed the Fellowship in Global Journalism at the Munk School of Global Affairs, where I reported for various media outlets, including the National Post and VICE, on the use of religion to combat, and sometimes contribute to, human trafficking. I wrote stories on the quirkier side of religion (an American Internet-based church that evangelizes at porn shows across the world) and its more inspiring side (a Catholic group that successfully turns thousands of refugees into Canadians). And as I currently investigate forced marriage in religious communities in Canada, I feel even more confident in my choice to write on religion for as wide an audience as possible. Modern religions are indeed an ever-evolving force to be reckoned with, especially as the line between religion and politics is increasingly blurring around the world, and journalists are an integral part of ensuring we get the whole story.

The University of Oxford’s Lunar Thermal Mapper (LTM) instrument has passed an important milestone on its journey to the Moon, with its recent installation on NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft at Lockheed Martin Space in Colorado, USA. The cutting-edge camera, supported by the UK Space Agency, will map the surface temperature and composition of the lunar surface at a resolution of around 50 metres. In combination with the spacecraft’s High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3), this will help scientists to determine the abundance, location, and form of the Moon’s water. Both instruments have now been installed on the Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft: a small satellite measuring only 3.5 meters wide with its solar panels fully deployed. This will search for evidence of water on the lunar surface to provide maps to guide future robotic and human explorers, including the Artemis program’s human landings. Water on the Moon could be used in a variety of ways, from purifying it as drinking water to processing it for fuel and breathable oxygen. The LTM will use four broadband infrared channels to provide maps of the lunar surface temperature ranging from approximately -163°C to 127°C. The instrument will also use eleven narrow infrared channels to map small variations in the composition of silicate minerals that make up the rocks and soils of the Moon’s surface. This will provide more information about what the lunar surface is made of and where water may potentially be found. Meanwhile, the HVM3 (built by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California) will detect and map the form, abundance, and locations of water over the lunar landscape by measuring spectral fingerprints (wavelengths of reflected sunlight). By measuring the same locations at different times of day, Lunar Trailblazer will be able to detect if the amount of water changes on this airless body, for instance, by transforming into a gas as the surface heats up, or accumulating like frost in the shadowed regions as the surface cools down. The mission will help answer key questions such as whether water molecules might be locked up inside lunar rock, or if the permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles hold significant quantities of water ice. Lunar Trailblazer was selected by NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program in 2019: a competition to propose future small satellite missions. Lunar Trailblazer will launch as a secondary payload on a planned lunar lander mission led by Intuitive Machines, effectively hitchhiking on the larger spacecraft. This is expected to launch in 2024. Professor Neil Bowles, Instrument Scientist for LTM at the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, said: ‘Designing, building, testing and now delivering LTM for its trip to the Moon is a fantastic example of the innovative and dedicated teams at Oxford and across the UK, especially given the challenges of the recent pandemic. The data from the mission will help us to understand how water is transported across the surface and potentially captured in cold traps near the lunar poles, allowing follow-up from future human robotic exploration.’ For the Planetary Experiments Group at the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, building the LTM is the latest achievement in a 50-year history of developing components for spaceflight and infrared thermal mapping cameras, including for missions to Mars, Saturn, and the Moon. In 2014, the department built and launched a small infrared thermal camera as part of the UK spacecraft TechDemoSat-1, to test technologies that could help create thermal maps of asteroids. Building on this previous experience meant that the Oxford team were strongly placed to propose an updated thermal camera for Lunar Trailblazer.

AI will have a dramatic effect on universities: in terms of staffing, students, courses, marking, everything, he insists. Everything you ever thought you knew, be prepared to forget. But, maintains the enthusiastic educator, the opportunities are going to be amazing. And he should know. Professor Dutta’s doctorate was in Artificial Intelligence. He has been researching, teaching and consulting on AI strategy for years. So, he is able to talk with more certainty (than someone who has just seen the Matrix) of the coming changes in employment – and management – that are heading our way. Professor Dutta smiles. Long-held certainties about the workplace are coming to an end. There will be changes that business schools (and universities) should embrace, he says, with rather more enthusiasm than many will feel in higher education. ‘Your job could be done using AI,’ he says casually and rather depressingly, before admitting the new technological age is a slightly terrifying prospect, for business school Deans, as well as everyone else. ‘It’s going to change jobs, remove a lot of jobs, we can’t predict or visualise very well what will be the impact at this point,’ he says. ‘We’re not very good at visualizing impacts in times of exponential change.’ But Professor Dutta is clearly determined not to shy away from the possibilities offered by AI, and is already thinking about what the Oxford Saïd will be able to do – and how it can embrace the opportunities. Right now, though, no one can be certain, exactly what is coming, he suggests – other than saying change is coming. ‘What we will be able to do [with computer power advances that are coming] it’s hard to predict now,’ he says. ‘But we will be affected to a very large degree. The nature of work is going to change. We are going to have to rethink all organisations and certainly universities as we know them.’ It is not just writers who will be looking for alternative employment – thanks to advances in programmes such as ChatGPT. So many roles will change - software engineers, lawyers…lecturers, perhaps? ‘Models may be replaced. Why would you need them, when you can use AI images?’ He asks. And it is not just that machines will be able to assimilate data and produce answers more quickly. ‘AI will be able to reason better and be better at creativity. Machines will be able to do a vast range of things. There are chatbots already which build emotional bonds. There are millions of men in China with the same AI girlfriend “Xiaoice”. Have you seen the movie ‘Her’? (Where a man falls in love with his computer’s operating system)? It’s happening for real.’ So, what does all this mean for a business school and for the students who travel across the world to come to Oxford to learn from experts at the Oxford Saïd? Surely, they will be at the frontline of a new world – where staff and managers are potentially made redundant and business thinking will be done by machines? While many would rather not think about it, Professor Dutta is hungrily considering the implications. His travelling allows time for thinking and perspective. The Oxford Saïd’s Dean has a very busy schedule. As well as leading the business school, he is an author and an entrepreneur – showing the way for his students. And he has also been linked as an adviser to the White House and Davos. He volunteers for non-profits organisations and squeezes every minute out of the day. As befits the head of such an internationally-focused business school, Professor Dutta’s family spans three continents. And before coming to Oxford, he crossed the globe in a dizzying progress. Born in India, where his family still lives in Goa and he visits regularly, after graduation, he went to take a Doctorate at Berkeley. He met his wife, Lourdes Casanova, a fellow academic, while they were studying in California (she won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship). At the moment, she is teaching at Cornell University’s College of Business in New York. Meanwhile, their daughter, Sara Dutta, who studied at Oxford, is currently based on the western seaboard of the United States.

As we have noted recently on QUAD, the story of Oxford’s role in the service of World War Two intelligence, via staff and students, remains fragmentary and in large part unacknowledged, principally because of the Official Secrets Act rather than deliberate neglect. One possible (and striking) conclusion to take from this superb biography is that John Langshaw Austin may have been more important for his role in World War Two military intelligence than his philosophical thinking, viewed over the long run. At least you could take that view, resulting in a complete upheaval in our understanding of him and despite that fact that approximately a thousand times more words have been written about Austin the philosopher than Austin the WW2 intelligence officer. Look at the situation. Rowe takes nearly 400 pages to arrive at what traditionally has been taken as the starting gun on Austin’s ‘main’ career, his post-war ascent in Oxford as a plain language philosopher. He was cut short by lung cancer and died in 1960. He did not publish much and by general agreement his grip on Oxford philosophy was partly down to his terrifying manner, long since dissipated. Yet this same individual Austin left the army with the rank of lieutenant colonel and was honoured for his intelligence work with an OBE, the French Croix de Guerre, and the U.S. Officer of the Legion of Merit. We find out here not only about the D-Day intelligence for which he had already been cited, but his minor-major role in cottoning on to what Germany was planning to do in North Africa and making the high-ups take notice, a much more delicate and earlier juncture in the war, when an Allied victory was totally up in the air. Austin also played a major role in the intelligence side of the Ardennes counter-offensive mounted by Hitler in the winter of 1944-5. He was one of those individuals who was famous among his immediate colleagues for his mind and his work ethic rather than his ability to party. Having said that he was nearly killed gawping at a night time London blitz from a roof top - a fashionable thing to do if you were posh or fancied your chances. Aside from the war, Oxford looms large as it might. Austin attended Balliol in 1929; before the war he was at Magdalen as a don, and after it as the White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy at Corpus (from 1952-). It is not for this tiny review of an evidently great book to wade in on the philosophy, but it’s interesting to note the degree to which Austin appears to have struck very different appearances to very different audiences; kind and generous in private or in supervisory roles towards students, but formidable in public or in combat. All the ‘a’ words exude from this book like linguistic toothpaste. Acid, ascerbic, astringent, arrogant, and most of all austere. So scared were other philosophers of wrongly deploying language, that they lowered their scope to the detriment of debate, philosophy and maybe even the University. ‘Papers tended to concentrate on small verbal matters, and be unambitious, short, and read very slowly.’ It was an intensely critical air that prevailed, Austin at the top. Years later there was a tendency to couch questions in convoluted layers of caveat, noted a contemporary. This excessive caution came to define bits of Oxford well into the late 20th Century and even beyond, not just in philosophy but in ordinary matters of college management. That was a shame. On a lighter note there was a bottled, non-alcoholic apple drink Austin would pick up for his children alarmingly called Cidrax! That was when he and his wife Jean, an alumna of Somerville, had moved to a large house in Old Marston. Jean outlived John by over half a century, and only after her death in 2016 did the copious evidence emerge for this study in the form of cardboard boxes full of letters and documents. Seven years later, which is not long, we have this book.

Like the University, like the company: Oxa, formerly Oxbotica, has changed beyond recognition in recent years yet retains a collegial civility that other companies would do well to match, plus a ravenous eye on global growth as it ‘scales’, to use the industry jargon. Principal Engineer Colin McManus (LMH, 2011) heads Oxa’s core software product and has been at the company since the beginning. His LinkedIn profile states unambiguously: ‘Actively Hiring’, and the company website shows over 15 vacant positions, a rare instance of growth at a moment when many of the recent headlines about self-driving cars have concerned lay-offs and closures. To explain this apparent paradox is to dig to the base of what makes Oxa so special and so unusual. But first the stunning headline that Oxa, rebranded from Oxbotica on 30 May, is the toast of the UK innovation community in 2023, having recently snaffled $140 million in a Series C funding round despite an otherwise lack lustre investor environment for deep tech. To be clear that’s $140 million for a company with 350 employees, mostly based in Oxford but with satellite teams in Toronto, Canada and Colorado, US. No surprise that Oxa founder Professor Paul Newman (Balliol, 1991) was just appointed Commander of the British Empire (CBE) for services to engineering and technology in the 2023 King’s Birthday Honours. He is also the CTO for the company and recently became President, the CEO role belonging to Gavin Jackson. The funding success is an extraordinary testimony to Paul’s original vision, when he founded the company with co-founder Ingmar Posner, in 2014 (Ingmar is a Professor of Engineering Science at Oxford, specialising in applied artificial intelligence). That vision was always anchored in reality, while still being visionary – a very difficult balance to strike in a sector notorious for hype. Paul initially left Oxford to work in Sydney, Australia, and then at MIT in Boston. He then returned to Oxford as a young academic. ‘I was insatiable and delighted. I was surrounded by greats. I could make something unreasonable here. Oxford felt like a ‘yes kind of place.’ Perhaps the best way of stating the Oxa vision is via one of its early institutional investors, cleantech venture capitalist company Kiko Ventures. ‘At Kiko Ventures we decided early on that autonomous vehicle software offered huge potential, but we envisaged different applications to most investors. Instead of self-driving cars taking us around town, we believe autonomy will initially be deployed in, for example, goods delivery, safety-critical industrial environments and multi-occupancy on-demand urban shuttles.’ Bryn Balcombe, responsible for Autonomy Systems and Regulations at Oxa since February 2022, says ‘I have always respected the very realistic stance of Oxa regarding what’s possible, and by when, in this sphere.’ If that’s praise for Oxa, it is also a measuring stick for what’s recently gone ‘wrong’ in the world of self-driving cars, although anyone working around experimental technology will say that ‘wrong’ is a bit blunt, it’s rather that the road to autonomous vehicles was inevitably more twisty than initially thought.

Parkwalk has launched the University of Oxford Innovation Fund VI (UOIF VI), the sixth fund in a decade long partnership with Oxford University Innovation (OUI). The new fund will once again invest in companies seeking to commercialise discoveries made at the University of Oxford and the broader University of Oxford technology cluster, enabling investors to support the introduction of innovative technologies and benefit from incentives provided under the UK’s Enterprise Investment Scheme. Previous University of Oxford Innovation funds, which have attracted support partly from the alumni community, have provided financial backing to 25 early-stage science and tech-based businesses, such as Brainomix Opsydia and Mind Foundry. Brainomix is a specialist in AI-powered imaging of biomarkers, which is revolutionising the time-sensitive treatment of strokes, while Mind Foundry is a developer of advanced machine learning algorithms and recently closed an £18 million Series C funding. The launch of UOIF VI follows a recent report by investment consultancy Beauhurst naming the University of Oxford as the leading academic institution in the UK for generating spinout companies. OUI, the University of Oxford’s technology transfer office, has now helped to create over 300 companies responsible for raising more than £6billion in external investment since 2010. Last year alone saw the inception of 15 new spinout companies, raising over £953 million in fields as varied as optical neural networks and algorithms for quantum computers. The University now has nearly 5,000 patents under management, and the pipeline of investment opportunities remains strong, with seven companies spun out in 2023 so far. Parkwalk backs world-changing technologies emerging from the UK’s leading universities and research institutions. With £500 million of assets under management, the company has invested in over 160 companies across its own funds, including those it manages for the University of Oxford. Adam Workman, Head of Investments and New Ventures at OUI says, ‘With the partnership between Oxford University Innovation and Parkwalk Advisors nearing ten years it’s great to see the launch of UOIF VI. There is an exciting pipeline of investment opportunities from the vibrant Oxford ecosystem for UOIF VI to invest in.’ Parkwalk CEO Moray Wright says, ‘In a time where we are facing global challenges, from inflation to concerns over food and water security, visionary science and technology companies are the key to finding solutions to improve our future. We know from experience that the University of Oxford is buzzing with entrepreneurial thinkers who push boundaries and transform industries. But for great ideas to become great industries, early-stage businesses need a helping hand. Our University of Oxford Innovation Funds offer a unique opportunity to back the technology of the future.’

‘Co-design to deliver Scalable Tidal Stream Energy’ (CoTide) will bring together three multi-disciplinary teams from the universities of Oxford, Edinburgh, and Strathclyde. Backed by investment from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the project will address the key challenges that are currently preventing the tidal energy sector from reaching its full potential. Project lead Professor Richard Willden, from the University of Oxford’s Department of Engineering Science, said: ‘We have a huge opportunity as a country to harness the powerful tides that surround us and use innovative engineering to develop greater energy security and solutions to help meet our 2050 net zero goals.’ ‘This EPSRC investment in CoTide allows us to bring together world-class engineering expertise and drive forward the kind of creative, collaborative research that will ensure the UK remains a world-leader in tidal stream development and deployment.’ Achieving the UK’s target to reach net zero by 2050 requires the decarbonisation of our energy supplies and a huge expansion of renewable energy generation from the current 50GW to 120-300GW. The powerful tides that surround the UK are currently underutilised for their energy potential, the main site currently within Pentland Firth in Scotland, called MeyGen. Unlike the wind and the sun, tides ebb and flow at predictable times each day, and so have the advantage that they can provide power that is both renewable and reliable, enabling more resilient energy networks. CoTide will focus on developing state-of-the-art tidal stream turbine systems. Unlike more traditional tidal barrages and tidal lagoons that require turbines to be installed in structures such as dams or sea walls, tidal stream turbines are fixed directly out at sea in the line of the strongest, most suitable tidal flows. This makes them cheaper to build and install, and reduces their environmental impact. If fully developed across the UK, tidal stream systems have the potential to generate in excess of 6GW, enough to power over 5 million homes, with an export market worth £25bn supporting over 25,000 marine energy jobs. But technical challenges remain, and tidal stream systems require careful design to maximise power whilst providing reliability in hostile marine environments characterised by corrosive seawater and unsteady loading caused by waves and turbulence. To tackle this, CoTide will bring together three multi-disciplinary teams, each with deep world-leading expertise across all relevant areas, including device hydrodynamics, rotor materials, corrosion, risk and reliability, environmental modelling, and system control and optimisation. Together, the researchers will integrate these constituent elements into holistic design processes that will significantly reduce costs by removing unnecessary redundancy and improving engineering solutions and processes. Professor Willden added: ‘Through a unified co-design approach, CoTide will develop a framework to assess the impact of design decisions and will contribute fundamental understanding of how to achieve through-life reliability in addition to maximising the potential of digitalisation for optimal performance.’ CoTide will build on the Oxford team’s unique capabilities and the University’s recent investment in a state-of-the-art current and wave flume that will allow the rapid testing of turbine and platform designs (illustrated above and right). The researchers will work with a group of over twenty industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies including EDF Energy Plc, the Health and Safety Executive, the Marine Energy Council, and global manufacturer Arkema International. This will ensure that CoTide's outputs will deliver new tools, models, and processes that achieve direct industrial impact. Sue Barr, Chair of the Marine Energy Council, said: ‘In order for tidal stream energy to become more competitive, we need real step changes in system performance, reliability metrics and scalability of the technology, which will require integrated tools which can be utilised by the sector… (The CoTide project’s) collaborative and innovative scope provides a real opportunity for successful outcomes.’

A keen cricket fan, Blyth’s academic background is in statistics and he has noted, jovially, that he shares the status as 3rd Wrangler in Cambridge University’s Mathematics Tripos with the acknowledged father of statistics, Karl Pearson (1879), ‘3rd Wrangler’ meaning that he came third in his year among other first-class mathematics degrees. An academic career in statistics turned into a stint in banking, but he truly hit his stride in 2006 when he moved to Harvard University to work for and subsequently lead the Harvard Management Company. At the same time, Stephen was able to teach statistics to undergraduates, something he enjoyed immensely, and which he says allowed him to see up close how transformational great universities can be to their students, in every sense and not just teaching and research. He won awards for his teaching and was known for breaking up long lectures with ‘random information’ about something unconnected, a trick he had learned about when himself an undergraduate years earlier in the UK. Students in his classes might suddenly find themselves learning about Bayes theorem or discussing the history of Cadbury’s, the chocolate maker, or exploring Salman Rushdie’s early career. Seeing how Harvard could offer financial support to any student with talent, Stephen is deeply focused on inclusion, and on finding a way to provide full bursaries or scholarships for talented students from low-income backgrounds. In this context, the LMH Foundation Year was a huge draw for Stephen when choosing to apply for the Principalship at LMH, because he is firmly committed to finding ways to level the playing field for talented students from all backgrounds to achieve their educational goals and to be able to attend top universities, which is now a hugely expensive endeavour that leaves students saddled with huge debts or, in some cases, puts low-income students off applying altogether. Blyth says his view is that the Foundation Year ‘tackled access in a way that is really impactful.’ Imbued with plenty of the US can-do attitude, he speaks extensively about how investing in education leads to ‘compound returns’, and how higher education can ‘really shift the landscape.’ In short, he says that he would dearly love to see more of the US philanthropic culture of giving in the UK, where many of us – both Blyth and the author of this feature for example – benefited from full student grants for teaching and maintenance, today long gone. Since their introduction in 1998, student fees in the UK have, argues Blyth, blunted access to Higher Education for poor and moderate-income students. The statistical evidence for this statement is emerging but Blyth is insistent that ‘anecdotally, it’s a huge hurdle.’ In short, there are many young aspiring students who are deciding to take their chances in paid work directly from school, rather than incur student debt. Others struggle through their college years trying to hold down paying jobs to keep the debt at a minimal level, greatly interfering with the idea of three years of devoted study and all the other benefits of growing as a young adult. Blyth also wonders why student debt is structured as a graduate tax yet gets written off after forty years. ‘The write-off mechanism tells me that it might be better structured as a grant.’ It’s an oddly British fudge, one could argue. At Harvard, he says, if you are poor but talented you pay nothing. If you are rich but talented you pay. No fudge. He wonders whether LMH could find a way to build on its Foundation Year, created by his predecessor Alan Rusbridger in 2016, so that any applicant who makes the grade but can’t pay is fully funded by the college. What he loves about LMH is its ‘broad church,’ and the fact that as a pioneering women’s college it has always defined itself as progressive, as ‘open-minded and unpompous.’ Blyth also praises how supportive LMH feels when you are there. Moving into the Principal’s Lodgings on Fyfield Road last October meant that he was able to see the world through an LMH ‘bubble,’ ‘and a very good bubble it is,’ he says. Of course, he would dearly love to see the endowment rise. One reason is that LMH punches well above its weight as regards impact within the collegiate University, but because its endowment draw-down is smaller compared to wealthier colleges, it cannot subsidise student rents as much as it would like to.

Lady Margaret Hall recently had the honour of welcoming Elizabeth Kaser (Piggford, 1943, English) along with her daughter and granddaughter for a special visit on 31 May. At the age of 98, Elizabeth is, says the college, ‘to the best of our knowledge LMH's last living Bletchley Park alumna’. For years, the Official Secrets Act meant that this whole chapter of Oxford’s contribution to the war effort remained a nearly total blank. In Paul Addison’s chapter about the war in the official history of the University (1994), he makes light of the recruitment of academics to ‘various branches of cloak-and-dagger warfare,’ insisting that intellectuals were ‘a transient minority in the world of secret intelligence’. Just five names are then mentioned – all men. Yet LMH now knows of 33 women who were recruited, with the then college Principal Lynda Grier asked to cast around for suitable candidates. One of them was Elizabeth Kaser, who lived in Lodge Building Room 3 while studying English for all of one year before being whisked off to perform a role apparently resting on linguistic skills, later recording and intercepting transmissions. Women were frequently recruited for their competence in a modern language, often working alongside cryptographers and other codebreakers within teams at Bletchley Park, purchased in 1938 as a war station for the Government Code and Cypher School. During her visit to LMH, Elizabeth had the opportunity to meet with current college Principal Professor Stephen Blyth, engaging in a lively conversation about her experiences. Elizabeth recalled the high-powered ‘melee’ of the Oxford atmosphere with numerous important people tending to decamp to Oxford or Cambridge from London, when London was deemed too dangerous because of the threat of bombing. Previously a student at a convent school in Manchester, Elizabeth was the first pupil from her school to attend Oxford and only the second to attend university. She was a ground breaker in this context saying in a recorded oral history interview that she didn’t set out to ‘deliberately break rules but to make my own decisions…’ Elizabeth joined LMH at a time when it was still rare for women to progress to higher education. Just one year into her studies, Elizabeth went to work at the Mathematics Institute, where she helped to decode war communications for Bletchley Park. Reflecting on that time, she described it as an exhilarating period in her life. The atmosphere was urgent and intellectually stimulating. The onset of World War II had opened up new opportunities for women. Having signed the Official Secrets Act, Elizabeth worked in a clandestine role for the Secret Service, listening to and recording classified conversations. Following the war, Elizabeth worked for the World Health Organization in Geneva before eventually returning to Oxford with her young family. Of the other known Oxford women who served the country in a secret capacity, one of the most successful was Patricia Brown (Bartley, 1936). A little bit older than Elizabeth by the start of the war, Patricia progressed so rapidly that by January 1942 she was heading the prestigious German Diplomatic Section, with numerous men much her senior in years working under her direction. October of the same year saw a particular breakthrough in deciphering Floradora, as it was light-heartedly referred to internally (after a musical) – a twice encoded German diplomatic code. There is a list of LMH alumnae who are known to have served during the Second World War, but the matter is less clear for the other women’s colleges, such as St Hugh’s, St Hilda’s, Somerville and St Anne’s. Certainly there were other Oxford alumnae who served, one of them Janet Ferrier (St Hilda’s, 1937). But the role of Principal Lynda Grier at the time as a recruiter appears to have made Oxford’s first women’s college preeminent in World War Two female recruitment to the intelligence services. Another famous female British code breaker was Betty Webb, who celebrated her 100th birthday on May 13, 2023, and recently published her account of the matter, No More Secrets: My Part in Codebreaking at Bletchley Park. In a sentiment that would have been shared by many of her peers including those at Oxford, she said, ‘I wanted to do something more for the war effort than bake sausage rolls.’

Researchers have linked dietary data from over 55,000 individuals with data on the environmental impacts of the foods they eat. The team, from the Livestock, Environment and People (LEAP) project at the University of Oxford, found that the dietary impacts of vegans were around a third of those of high meat eaters. They also saw a 30% difference between high- and low-meat diets for most of the measures of environmental harm. Individuals classified themselves as vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian or meat eaters. Data on the environmental impact of their diets was assessed in relation to greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, water pollution risk and biodiversity loss. The team also took into account the variation in environmental impact based on how and where food is produced, including this variation in their results. This is important as it ensures that the results are based on all the available data about the environmental impact of foods, as opposed to focussing on specific food production methods which can obscure the relationship between animal-based food consumption and environmental impact, Despite substantial variation according to where and how food was produced, the relationship between environmental impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and the authors argue this should prompt policy actions to reduce meat production and consumption. The paper is published in Nature Food. The impact of the food we eat on the environment is well established. In 2015 the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions of the global food system was around a third of total emissions for that year.* The food system is estimated to be responsible for 70% of the world’s freshwater use and 78% of freshwater pollution. Around three quarters of ice-free land area of the planet has been affected by human use, primarily for agriculture and land use change such as deforestation is a major source of biodiversity loss.** Lead author, Professor Peter Scarborough, of the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at Oxford University, says: ‘Our dietary choices have a big impact on the planet. Cherry-picking data on high impact plant-based food or low impact meat can obscure the clear relationship between animal-based foods and the environment. Our results, which use data from over 38,000 farms in over 100 countries, show that high meat diets have the biggest impact for many important environmental indicators, including climate change and biodiversity loss. Cutting down the amount of meat and dairy in your diet can make a big difference to your dietary footprint.’ Past research has shown that plant-based diets are substantially lower than meat-based when it comes to environmental measures such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use and water use, and that reducing meat intake tends to be healthier. They have generally made assumptions about people’s food intake and have not taken into account variation in environmental impact depending on where and how food is sourced and produced. Professor Scarborough and the team looked at the way people actually eat, taking data from a sample of 55,000 UK individuals who filled out a food frequency questionnaire. They connected this to databases that estimate the environmental impacts of multi-ingredient and commonly consumed foods. Using a dataset of the environmental impact of food production systems, they were able to incorporate variation in where food is from and how it is produced. All five environmental impacts were associated with the amount of animal-based food consumed. The impacts of vegans were a quarter of those of high meat eaters for greenhouse gas emissions, and land use, just 27% of the impacts for water pollution, 46% for water use and 34% for biodiversity. At least 30% differences were found between low and high meat eaters for most of the indicators. The study expands on past work, underlining that vegan and vegetarian diets have much lower environmental impact than fish and meat consumption. The region of origin and methods of food production do not obscure the differences between diet groups and should not be a barrier to policy actions aimed at reducing animal-based food consumption.

The Oxford Union Society is no stranger to controversy. Founded in 1823 by Oxford students desperate to have a space to freely discuss matters of religion and politics, for 200 years our members have debated the state of international relations, theology, genetics, nuclear policy, civil rights, the environment and everything in between, often prompting fierce discussion across the world. However, we do not, and have never, sought controversy for controversy’s sake; rather, in recent years we have found ourselves in the spotlight merely for hosting speakers who hold views that some find disagreeable. Our ex-Librarian and former UK Prime Minister Harold MacMillan once described the Oxford Union as the ‘last bastion of free speech’; I do not think that statement has ever been as true or as necessary as it is now. Nevertheless, it is true that many moderate thinkers are now shying away from the mere mention of certain issues in case they should they fall victim to a small minority with a disproportionately loud voice. Before I came to Oxford, I thought that tales of cancel culture at universities were exaggerated to sell papers. How wrong I was. To digress from – or even merely challenge - certain viewpoints is to be labelled as some sort of outlier or extremist, amplified by social media channels. We therefore have to ask ourselves: if we do not train and encourage today’s students to ask difficult questions, how will we tackle the most challenging issues of tomorrow, both at home and abroad? As the chilling effects of self-imposed censorship on university campuses, social media and the arts show no signs of dissipating, there has never been a more important time to defend free speech which, after all, is a principle enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: freedom of opinion and expression. Indeed standing up for this, is the greatest challenge facing anyone who undertakes a position of student leadership. These insults and accusations are not the comments of lone voices. They are dozens, often scores, of messages sent to me or my colleagues, tweeted, or posted anonymously on social media. I have been physically threatened and shouted at on the street. It is no surprise, therefore, that students up and down the UK are scared to stand up for free speech; to do so means opening oneself up to ritual humiliation, bullying, and harassment. Those that suggested, late last year, that we had ‘de-platformed’ speakers ought to reflect not only on the profile of our guest speakers and the nature of their visits – often under challenging security environments – but also the resilience that it takes for a student led organisation to proceed with an invitation to a controversial speaker. As we celebrate our Bicentenary, there is much to reflect on - notable debates that have reverberated around the world, our guest speakers who have been questioned and challenged by our members and, of course, our alumni life members who have shaped our heritage and history in the making. So far this year, we have celebrated 60 years since women were finally granted membership on equal terms as men after decades of campaigning by men and women alike. We have celebrated the 90th anniversary of the Union’s most famous debate ‘This House Would Not Fight For King And Country’, noted in the diary of Mussolini and reported to have persuaded Hitler to believe the British would not fight. Perhaps most notably, in late February we hosted our Bicentenary Debate, welcoming back hundreds of alumni life members including Baron Heseltine of Thenford (ex-President, Michaelmas 1954) and Amanda Pritchard (ex-Librarian, Hilary 1996) to celebrate 200 years of free speech at the Oxford Union. Amidst the celebrations, however, we remain more determined than ever to echo the University’s affirmation that ‘free speech is the lifeblood of a university…it enables the pursuit of knowledge…it helps us approach truth.’

Many explanations have been given for why Vladimir Putin decided to launch an invasion, often citing NATO expansion and Ukraine’s movement towards EU membership. Meanwhile, considerable surprise has been voiced around the world, since 24 February 2022, at Ukrainian’s determination to repel the invasion. Yet, who would be surprised were Austria to repel an invasion by Germany? Would anyone voice amazement if Canadians volunteered to fight, while US bombs rained down on Toronto. The queries that have dominated much public discourse about Ukraine in the last year have the same root: Ukraine was not seen as a ‘proper’ country by either the east or west. The only difference is that now, one year since the invasion, most countries – with the notable exception of Russia – see Ukraine for what it is: a sovereign country. With ever more troops on Ukrainian soil, the Russian president still evidently views Ukraine as part of a greater Russia and Ukrainians as Russians, even if they are not. Attacking and seizing territory in Ukraine, therefore, perpetuates a Russian narrative around its right to a sphere of influence – or, call it what it is, an empire. Domination of its neighbours is a Soviet throwback, an imperial aspiration, and should, consequently, be seen in that way. Putin does hence not recognise the sovereignty of Ukraine, nor international law more generally, which does not bode well for a peace process, of course. But it must be realised that this thinking about Ukraine is deeply ingrained in both the east and west, even if implicitly. For many countries, even Ukraine’s friendly neighbours, the state’s name bears a definite article. It is The Ukraine, meaning the borderland. The international community has been taken by surprise by the patriotism and determination of Ukrainians, who only achieved independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But in the years prior to, and in the three decades since the USSR’s collapse, Ukraine had a civil society and sense of national identity, as is also true for other former Soviet republics. This is not to say that nation-building has not also been challenged since 1991, as again, is also true in other former Soviet republics’ identity, including Russia. The collapse of the status brought by the USSR was a huge loss for Russia. Putin, himself, described it as the worst thing to happen in the 20th Century. A mark of this narrative can be seen by what has happened to Russia’s national anthem; the Soviet era anthem was replaced in 1991 by a new Russian piece of music. It was not popular with Russians. When Putin came to power less than a decade later, he then revived the Soviet anthem – and with it came Russia’s sense of itself as a power in respect to its neighbours. Hence, although Ukraine has been a sovereign state since 1991, the war that Ukraine has been fighting for the last 12 months (and eight years) is a war of independence. While it is not necessarily in the traditional sense of the term, as Ukraine’s statehood is already recognised by the international community, but more as the state’s expression of its autonomy, agency, and ability to decision its own future: a future where Ukraine is always seen for what it is: a sovereign country.

Ten years ago next month, the Ertegun Graduate Scholarship Programme in the Humanities was officially opened by the Chancellor. But to trace its inception we need to look back a further five years, to a Led Zeppelin concert in the O2 arena in December 2007. The band had been fostered by the legendary Turkish-born founder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, and when he died suddenly at the end of 2006, they reformed to hold this hugely-successful concert as a tribute to him. Led Zeppelin then very generously made a substantial donation from the profits to establish the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund, under the direction of Mica Ertegun, Ahmet’s Romanian-born widow and a successful New York interior designer, thereby providing a scholarship for a Turkish student to study at Oxford. In this way a relationship was formed between Mica Ertegun and the University and with the then Vice-Chancellor, John Hood. Over the next five years, this led to Mica’s foundation of the Ertegun Programme, funding in her name and Ahmet’s not just one scholarship, but up to twenty at a time, specifically in the Humanities (which Mica and her husband had always passionately supported). Twenty graduate scholarships for the cash-strapped Humanities is cause enough for major celebration, but the Ertegun Programme is very much more than financial support for individual scholars, crucial though that is for the young people starting off along this path. Mica Ertegun wanted to create a community of learning, and to this end funded the refurbishment of 37a St Giles’, an elegant stone-fronted Georgian House, now aptly named ‘Ertegun House’. Within it the scholars have all that a graduate student can wish for: a spacious central Oxford desk in a stylish and beautifully-appointed building with 24-hour access every day of the year; a large and flexible seminar-room where they can organise and host academic events; a kitchen-common room for less formal interaction, as well as an elegant courtyard and garden. On the ground floor, with their doors always open to all, there are two members of staff whose job it is to support the students in every way they can: a senior academic of the University, seconded for a number of years to serve as the ‘Senior Scholar in Residence’; and a full-time Administrator, ensuring the smooth running of the institution and able to help with any problem that emerges. On top of this there is a budget for events, which might be a group-visit to an exhibition, or the funding of a one-day workshop in a scholar’s specialist subject. Ten years on, can we confidently say that the programme has worked? I am as well qualified as anyone to judge, as I was the first ‘Senior Scholar’ in Ertegun House, serving in that role for four years, and I have subsequently remained closely involved with the programme. I can say, hand on heart, that it has succeeded magnificently. The basic facts alone are impressive: the programme has supported, or is still supporting, 141 scholars from all the continents of the globe, studying for a variety of degrees between the MSt and the DPhil, and across the full range of Humanities subjects, from formal Logic to Egyptology. And Ertegun House really does work as a community, and in many different ways: offering scholars invaluable peer-support, as well as encouragement from above, in their research (which is often a lonely business); breaking down the barriers of hyper-specialisation that are one of the curses of modern academic life; and encouraging ambition and interdisciplinary thought. A high point of every week is the Wednesday lunchtime seminar, that all scholars must attend, where each in turn explains their research to their colleagues, and then fields comments and questions. It was fascinating and hugely pleasurable to work as the Senior Scholar at Ertegun House, interacting with bright young minds from across the world, in an environment that is perfectly suited to support and encourage research and debate. I benefitted greatly from my four years at Ertegun House, in terms of being intellectually stretched and tested, but always in a positive environment. I can say with confidence that the same is true of all who pass through the Programme.

We have all seen images of distressed animals and devastated regions affected by flooding, fire and rising temperatures. They show real decline in ecosystems around the world from coral reefs to Australian or Amazonian forests, from peatlands to the Arctic tundra. This is a time of immense pressure on the natural world. But the natural world is also critical to the climate - and our future. Threats to climate and biodiversity are not separate ‘issues’, to be approached from different directions. They are intrinsically linked. Today, two briefings are published, one by the Royal Society and the other by the Interacademy Partnership, which is the collective voice of the world’s science, engineering & medical academies, ranging from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, from the USA to China. The briefings were prepared by leading scientists from around the world and approved by various national academies, and together represent the collective view of the UK’s and the world’s science academies. I was in the fascinating position of chairing this process at both the UK and international level.  The briefings highlight that biodiversity must be at the heart of discussions around climate change. They are inseparable. This is not chance timing. This week, biodiversity is the subject of a major UN conference, COP15. In less than a month, it is a key theme of the ‘main event’ - COP26 in Glasgow. World leaders and policymakers are going to arrive in Scotland from around the globe to talk about climate change. And nature is at the ‘top table’. But, we argue today, it does not just need to be present, it needs to underpin decision-making. Our report, published by the Royal Society, calls on world leaders to ensure integrated climate and biodiversity policies. Only in this way can biodiversity be protected, at the same time as contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In our briefing, we detail how climate change leads to a range of impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. And it has a circular impact: rising temperatures lead to fires, droughts and floods, these lead to degradation of ecosystems, which leads to further climate change. After all that bad news, the good news is, we can do something about it. Both climate change and the natural world can be supported and biodiversity encouraged. By integrating climate and biodiversity policies, the full potential of biodiversity can support climate action. Nature-based solutions can help mitigate climate change: they are available now, but need massive investment to work at the scale required. There are significant actions which can be taken immediately, for example in terms of restoring peatlands, improving forests, encouraging sustainable farming and less meat and dairy consumption, as well as increasing the amount of land and sea area protected. But there are hazards too. Some types of interventions to mitigate climate change, such as planting trees in natural grasslands or savannas, or expansion of bioenergy, can further increase pressure on our lands and further harm biodiversity. Moreover, such nature-based solutions must be implemented alongside massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and not be a substitute or excuse for delay on action on these emissions. And all such solutions must involve the cooperation and engagement with local communities to ensure fair outcomes. Over the coming few months we have a unique opportunity to address the climate change and biodiversity crises in an ambitious and joined-up manner. We must seize that chance.

Hunger pandemic. Poverty tsunami. 500 million people nudged into poverty. 300,000 dying daily of starvation for the next three months. Dealing with the reality behand these headlines is massively complex, but the brute fact is that they predate the pandemic. COVID-19 has made it all worse. How do we broaden our horizons and look far enough ahead to ensure that our responses to the present crisis don’t hamstring us down the line? It is too easy right now to narrow our horizons at the expense of lucid thinking and sensible action. Allow me to connect some big problems by presenting the King of Fruits. The Pakistani mango is a bright and wonderful presence in our exquisitely blistering summers. It is an entirely different beast when compared to those mangoes one occasionally finds lurking in British supermarkets. With over 1,500 varieties, of which at least 30 are grown commercially, the mango is an important element in a Pakistani summer. The vivid fruit weigh down produce stalls and brighten up food markets. One does not simply eat a mango. One surrenders to it. The mango and many other fruits and vegetables are threatened by COVID-19. Mangoes cannot be stored for long, and time is running out to harvest and ship this year’s crop. Nearly two million tonnes of Pakistani mangoes are typically shipped annually to over 50 countries, but in 2020 it may not happen. Conflicting COVID policies now mean that laborers cannot travel, transporters cannot operate, food prices are low, the harvest is at risk and food producers suffer. Pakistan is one of the many countries projected to face severe food insecurity as a result of COVID-19. In so many other ways the crisis was already well underway because of the rapidly creeping spectre of climate change. Fruit crops are falling prey to extreme weather events, shifts in temperature and rainfall, and ravenous pests. These maladies have a crushing impact on the wellbeing of ordinary citizens. At least half the country’s households face food security stress of some form. Almost 40% of children under-5 are stunted. The situation is dire now for millions of vulnerable people. It will get worse. Why would any of this matter to those not from the region? Let us explore this complex question through pathways for change. Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan has already implemented an unusual measure to cope with the costs of the crisis. The unemployed are earning money through the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami project. This is a government initiative to reforest parts of the country, begun in 2014. Now expanded, it’s an attempt to alleviate COVID hardship but not forget climate change. Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country in the world for climate change. Besides the catastrophic environmental, social, and economic costs, it is climate change’s impacts that spell a death knell for the fruit and vegetable sector which supports millions of people in the country. Agri-food reforms are firmly on the meu too. The Ehsaas poverty alleviation program has helped over 12 million families by providing emergency cash assistance to those affected by the lockdown. Barriers to financial inclusion and empowerment are also being removed by improvements to mobile and internet banking. The critical factor now will be to continue developing the necessary institutional and policy support to ensure that these programs can function as long-term social and financial safety nets for the most vulnerable of our population. There is great room for innovation and optimism right now. It is easy to imagine the end of the world as we know it but let us make room for imagination. Let us now imagine biting into a wonderfully succulent mango. The fruit is joy and happiness, but is sometimes measured also in messiness. Humans are resilient. We will get through this to a new normal. Let us ensure that we don’t leave behind a great swathe of the population.

Everyone is agreed on the desirability of de-carbonising transport. It contributes as much as one quarter of greenhouse gases and keeps rising instead of falling. But electric cars aren’t quite up to snuff yet nor an environmental panacea, while snarling congestion stalks most major cities. These themes defined the Oxford EV Summit, hosted recently by the Said Business School for its second year. ‘EV’ stands for ‘electric vehicle.’ Last year, the discussion revolved around how regular cars could be replaced by their battery electric brethren. This year the discussion ran away into discrete, unanticipated areas and there was more nuance and caution. The recurring leitmotif, familiar to anyone who attends such conferences, was how electric vehicles face barriers of cost, performance and infrastructure. Yet they’re nearly here so keep coming! A good example is the electric Mini that will be built from the autumn in Cowley, Oxford’s industrial suburb to the east of the city. Launched on July 9th, it costs approximately £8,000 more than an entry-price petrol model, offers a range of 124 miles instead of the more conventional 400 miles (more for diesel), and cannot be recharged at the vast majority of garages. It also weighs 145kgs more on account of the batteries. Yet Paul McNamara, Technical Director for Williams Advanced Engineering, a sister company to the Oxfordshire-based Formula 1 racing team (so a thorough petrol head, just to be clear), began by rewinding the clock to 1885-1915. During that 30-year period, he noted, there were horses, electricity and petrol. In his view, had electrical applications been just 20-30% better, electric cars might have taken off then. Instead, Henry Ford got going in 1908 and liquid fuels prevailed. So successful were they that by the 1930s crowds would gather in San Francisco to gleefully burn beautiful wooden street trams that had until then glided around on electricity. The privately-owned, internal combustion-engined car had won. A century later and the internal combustion engine looks like a very inelegant solution, not to say a historic mistake. At least it does so if propulsive efficiency is the criterion of success. An electric motor is approximately 85% efficient. 85% of the energy it consumes becomes forward motion. The corresponding figure for an internal combustion engine is just 25-30%, the primary waste expressed as heat and unburned fuel as noxious gases and particles injurious to health. The very success of the car has been its ruin, in this telling of the story. Where once the inefficiency and the pollution didn’t register owing to smaller numbers of cars, now we are swamped. There are simply too many of them. The UK has over 34 million vehicles trundling around now compared to half that figure in recent living memory. Better pollution controls have not succeeded in the face of sheer numbers and congestion, both a plague on Oxford as anyone who lives or studies here knows. Globally, there are over 1 billion vehicles, set to treble to 3 billion by 2050 according to the FIA Foundation. The vast majority of those will be internal combustion engines burning liquid fuels, a demoralising reality check for climate activists, air quality regulators and EV-advocates alike. On the plus side, grids are decarbonising in some countries making electrification seem like an obvious solution over time. The part-unsolved problem of electric cars lies not in energy efficiency but in energy storage. The tank of liquid fuel in a conventional car offers immense energy density for its volume and weight, compared to bulky, heavy batteries.

I had been feeling under the weather for some time when my health suddenly nose-dived: violent headaches, a burning face, dizziness, brain fog, palpitations, and utter exhaustion. This was September 2008, and the abrupt deterioration coincided with the installation of wi-fi and cordless landline phones in the Paris university building where I worked. After some digging online I found that many of my symptoms were shared by others. In an environment with little wireless connectivity, my symptoms would disappear. With the roll-out of smart meters and with 5G and the Internet of Things on the horizon, public exposure to anthropogenic radio-frequency radiation (RFR) used in wireless technologies is set to be ramped up further. Scientists from around the world are expressing increasing levels of concern about the health and environmental impacts of RFR exposure. In 2015, over 200 scientists from 41 countries, all specialists in the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on biological systems, signed an appeal to the UN and the WHO calling for more protective exposure limits and for the public to be advised to reduce its exposure to anthropogenic RFR. The current public health line is that exposure to RFR at levels that do not cause tissue heating—so-called non-thermal levels—is safe. The appeal to the UN begged to differ, noting that published effects at levels below current international guidelines included increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increases in harmful free radicals and genetic damage, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being. One of the most widespread impacts of RFR may be impaired sleep, which has many knock-on impacts on health. The number of mainstream press articles on sleeplessness has skyrocketed, and, while there are certainly many causes, several studies have associated RFR exposure with inhibiting the production of melatonin, the hormone essential for restorative sleep, which is also a powerful antioxidant. Blue light from screens together with ambient RFR levels may be contributing to the current epidemic of sleeplessness. The substantial—and ever-growing—body of evidence of biological effects from non-thermal RFR exposure has prompted me and many others all over the world to seek to raise awareness of the potential detrimental health impacts of long-term exposure to wireless radiation, especially among children and young people. Focusing on corporate interference in RFR science, the American weekly The Nation published, on 29 March 2018, a lengthy investigative article entitled ‘How Big Wireless Made Us Think That Cell Phones Are Safe: A Special Investigation. The disinformation campaign—and massive radiation increase—behind the 5G rollout.’ I would challenge anyone to remain unconcerned after reading this article. Since 2005 the UK Chief Medical Officers have recommended that children and young people under 16 should use mobile phones for essential purposes only and keep all calls short. Hardly any parents are aware of this advice, however; it has been very poorly disseminated and many children now routinely use smart phones. According to government data, half of UK children between the ages of 9 and 16 use a smart phone every day—in addition to being exposed to RFR all day at school in the form of wi-fi. As our increasingly RFR-dependent economy appears to be founded on a false scientific paradigm (i.e., anthropogenic RFR is harmless unless it causes body tissue to heat up), it will likely prove unsustainable in the long term. So besides exercising more restraint in our use of wireless as it stands, we ought to be looking into developing alternative technologies that are bio-compatible and thus future-proof. In parallel with developing a low-carbon economy, we should be aiming for a sustainable, low-RFR economy. With vision and ambition, the University of Oxford—or some of its enterprising alumni—could today start helping to pioneer the safe, bio-friendly technologies of tomorrow. I for one would be proud to see my alma mater take up the challenge.

What did the Romans ever do for us? It seems they added an inch to the average height of their British subjects — they came, they saw, we prospered. And after taking a plunge during the Anglo-Saxon era, the height of the average inhabitant rose again in the wake of the Norman Conquest. These are just two of the findings of new research using data from skeletal remains to calculate how the average height of men rose or fell over 2,000 years of history in what is now England. The result is a startling picture of changes in health and wellbeing. Using data of skeletal remains of men aged between 21 and 49 years from a range of archaeological excavations across England, they deduced individuals’ full heights from their femur length. Lead author Dr Gregori Galofré-Vilà (pictured right), from the Department of Sociology at the University of Oxford, said: ‘We believe our results shed new light on the development of health in England over the very long run.’ He and his team worked on the basis that height, linked with childhood nutrition, is a good measure of wellbeing and can be estimated accurately from the length of a full grown man’s femur. Biologists and epidemiologists have long recognised that although the main causes of variation in individual height may be genetic, changes in the economic, social and environmental circumstances are reflected in the mean heights of different groups of people at any given time. The working paper (which can be read in full here) reveals that men in this area of Britain became taller when it was under Roman occupation (200–410AD), with average height rising from 167cm (5ft 6in)  to 170cm (5ft 7in). The researchers suggest this rise in average height coincided with the Romans’ improved water supply and sanitation systems and a more varied diet. Heights did not decline immediately after the Romans left Britain in 410, but fell from 600AD. The paper highlights previous research suggesting that health may have deteriorated when populations moved out of the towns and cities set up by the Romans, abandoning the more hygienic water supplies and waste-disposal systems. Plague and pestilence then became common and infectious diseases were on the increase, with archaeological evidence also suggesting that diets were inadequate, notes the paper. In the wake of the Black Death of 1348–1350, however, average heights increased again; the paper notes that this coincided with a boost in agricultural production. From 1400 to the early 1650, mean height reached 173–174cm (5ft 8½in). ‘Our data shows that average heights in England in the medieval era and between 1400 and 1700 were similar to those of the 20th century,’ said Dr Galofré-Vilà. The early years of the 1600s were ‘unusually healthy’, and the paper notes that the introduction of poor laws may have contributed to better health for poorer sections of society. Heights fell after 1650, reaching just 169cm (5ft 6½in) in the late 1600s — a decline that continued until the early 1800s. The study compares the average heights of Englishmen with similar work previously carried out by Richard Steckel of Ohio State University, who created a European health index. Although the European and the English sets of evidence provide a consistent history, the Oxford-led study shows that the English may have escaped the worst of a Little Ice Age, when the medieval warm period was succeeded by a period of cooling with the health effects more marked across continental Europe. And what about the future? Galofré-Vilà said: ‘Since the early 19th century, average heights for Englishmen have increased substantially, reaching 175cm in 1950 and 177cm [5ft 10in] in 1970 — among the tallest of any population worldwide. If mean heights are a good measure of well-being, it seems we are now in previously uncharted territory. Within the last 100 years, the average heights of Englishmen have risen more than at any time in recorded history.’

Around the world, more than 100 million people are displaced by violence and persecution, and more than a quarter of them have crossed an international border to become refugees. Fleeing war and authoritarianism in countries such as Afghanistan, South Sudan and Ukraine, they have an internationally recognised right to seek sanctuary. Welcoming refugees is a human rights obligation, but it also brings enormous benefits to receiving countries. At our Refugee Studies Centre, a lot of our research shows that refugees bring skills, talents and aspirations to the communities that host them. Building on Oxford's history: As a university, we have a long history of welcoming refugees, dating back to welcoming refugee academics during the Second World War and up to the most recent support provided to students and academics affected by the war in Ukraine. The Ark of Civilization: Refugee Scholars and Oxford University, 1930-45 documents some of the extraordinary contributions refugees have made to our community. Welcoming students from displacement backgrounds enriches our community. On the MSc in Refugee and Forced Migration Studies, on which I teach, 10 of our 29 students in this year’s cohort have lived experience of displacement. The perspectives they have brought – from all around the world – have greatly strengthened the teaching and learning experience for everyone, including faculty. Establishing a community of sanctuary: Oxford is striving to create a community of welcome for sanctuary seekers, whether they be students, staff or members of our local community. Mansfield and Somerville colleges were both awarded College of Sanctuary status in 2021, having established sanctuary scholarships offering fully funded places for postgraduate study. Since then, the University and colleges have increased the number of full scholarships available to graduate students from displacement backgrounds. This academic year, the entire collegiate University responded rapidly to the crisis in Ukraine, by creating the Ukraine Graduate Scholars Programme. Alongside this, we have piloted the Refugee Academic Futures scholarship programmes, which combined the University’s Refugee Scholarships with a cohort support programme and support network for all students across Oxford who identify as having a displacement background. In 2022–3, at least 36 students with displacement backgrounds were awarded full scholarships to graduate degrees in Oxford. Looking ahead to 2023–4: Welcoming these students isn’t only the right thing to do, it also ensures we are recruiting students with potential from the broadest and most diverse pool of talent. We anticipate a similar number in 2023–4, thanks to the support of new scholarship funding, notably through Mastercard Foundation AfOx Scholarships and XTX Markets’ support for the Ukraine programme and the Hope scholarships, created in collaboration with the Weidenfeld Hoffmann Trust. Next year, our pan-University cohort programme will relaunch as ‘Oxford Sanctuary Community’, and we hope to encourage even greater internal and external funding for graduate and undergraduate scholarships for sanctuary scholars from every part of the world. University of Sanctuary status: Oxford has applied to be recognised as a University of Sanctuary, a status currently held by 24 universities across the country. This requires us to meet a series of minimum criteria and endorse the City of Sanctuary Charter. We hope the outcome decision on the University's sanctuary status will be confirmed soon. The process of applying has mobilised colleagues from across the University, colleges and city. Oxford's Sanctuary Fair: How can you get involved? On 11 May, we are organising a Sanctuary Fair at the Town Hall, in collaboration with the local NGO, Asylum Welcome. It will bring together refugees, students and the local community, and involves a diverse array of panel discussions, workshops and stalls. It aims to raise awareness and connect civil society organisations working within Oxford with students, staff and community. The event will run from 10.30am to 6.30pm and all are welcome – do come along!

This wonderful university is home to many brilliant students, researchers and academics, and some truly remarkable leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs. The University is now filing more patents and creating more spinouts than any other university in the UK. Nanopore, Evotec and Perspectum are going to transform healthcare, YASA is leading the electric vehicle revolution, and First Light Fusion is moving rapidly towards a sustainable energy solution. All these, and I could list many more, have much in common – they are the result of years of hard work by Oxford geniuses and they are all committed to making the University a national centre for innovation. Our students are similarly determined to tackle some of the greatest challenges facing our planet – the progress made by start-ups Quantum Dice, Oxwash and Deep Planet is breathtaking. Innovation is happening in every department, division and college. Colleagues in Humanities and Social Sciences are building major partnerships to drive policy development and the creation of new social enterprises – 11 so far, with 20 in the pipeline. SOPHIA, Oxford’s first social spin-out, based on the incredible work of Dr Sabina Alkire and her colleagues, is helping businesses all over the world to develop sustainable business practices. This university is brilliant, because of all the people in it. Our impacts are accelerated and amplified because of all the other brilliant people and organisations we choose to work with - Peter Ireland’s work with Rolls-Royce on turbine cooling; Humanities working with the National Trust; the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group working with AstraZeneca are all wonderful examples. We are now building more synergies with the large national infrastructures at Harwell and Culham. Oxford Science Enterprises have transformed the Oxford ecosystem in the past seven years – in this year alone, they have invested £270m in our new companies, and helped attract a further £750m from other investors. They are helping Oxford academics translate their research, and thereby create impact stories for the University, and benefits for society. To meet the insatiable demand for innovation space, they are now building new labs in the centre of Oxford. St John’s College is complementing this with a million square foot development in North Oxford, and the University has similar goals in Begbroke and Osney. We have initiated major cross university reviews on ‘innovation and commercialisation’ and ‘entrepreneurship training for our student body’. Our near-term ambition is to make Oxford the innovation hub of Europe. To achieve this it is clear that we must create more streamlined processes, attract more investors and diverse industries, and ensure greater financial benefits for the University. Many senior colleagues and external advisors are working hard to explore options and define recommendations. No-one can be in doubt that this collegiate university is a magnet for talent and a research powerhouse. Now, because of our ambitions, our collaborative ethos, our global outlook and our deeply engaged alumni, I’m confident that we can be the most impactful university in the world.

Oxford alumnus Michael Levin (Wadham, 1964) and his wife Nora Jean share a remarkable history of Jean’s formidable aunt Rebecca (1894-1993), who at the time of telling her story four decades ago aged 87, shared memories of Tsarist pogroms, command performances in Imperial Germany, a perilous cross-border passage during WW1, concerts in freezing halls for Red Army soldiers during the Russian Revolution, and other events that shaped the 20th Century and still resonate today. Rebecca was a child prodigy whose bassoonist father played under Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov.  Her parents knew talent was a ticket out of the Tsars’ restrictive Jewish Pale of Settlement.  They sent all four of their young children ‘beyond the Pale’ to the world’s greatest conservatories, to hone their skills. Charismatic Rebecca left Europe’s concert halls in 1924 to perform and teach in tiny primitive Mandate Palestine. In 1965 Ha’aretz described her as a ‘living legend to her students, present and past, who today are musicians and teachers all over the [world].’ In 1985 she was awarded the Keys to the City of Tel Aviv for her seminal role bringing classical music to ‘the land of Israel.’ Jean’s career has spanned teaching, writing, consulting, entrepreneurial, and non-profit roles. She and Mike met at the University of Pennsylvania and married in Oxford. He is an environmental lawyer, solar energy developer and writer. In 2021 they published A Border Town in Poland: A 20th Century Memoir, also published by Penn Convoy Press. In this book, Alexander Ross (New College, 2021), currently a research student within Oxford’s Faculty of History, highlights how creative entrepreneurs saved the Hollywood studios in the 1970s by establishing the calculated blockbuster, consisting of key replicable markers of success, as Hollywood's preeminent business model. Ross demonstrates how visionary individuals such as Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas, and Zemeckis helped create the modern, calculated blockbuster business model (BBM). However, with the rise of streaming giants such as Netflix and the studios struggling to compete, many consumers decide what to watch from the comfort of their homes, making the difference between ‘cinema’ and ‘television’ anachronistic and opening up a galaxy for enterprising film makers focused on their art, as opposed to box office revenue streams. Revisiting the history of those pioneering 1970s blockbusters, Ross offers distinct analysis about the possible future of the calculated blockbuster, or whether the streamers will continue to generate their own content and, eventually, take control. Scholars of film studies, screenwriting, and popular culture will find this book of particular interest. he author (New College, 2008) has an interesting backstory having worked in Oxford ahead of matriculating. He says, ‘I came to Oxford as a researcher in human viral genetics in early 1996 and promptly discovered the early internet. Giving up all intentions of following an academic career, I taught myself programming and changed career direction [ed note: all good Oxonians seem to change career direction. It’s a sign of creativity]. Following the dot-com crash I found myself writing spam filters (just as spam was becoming a problem), and as part of our work we started finding nation-state cyber attacks that were getting blocked by our filters. As I tried to learn more about the issues we were uncovering, I discovered that there were no text books to teach members of the public the techniques of threat intelligence. The whole concept of civilians working in the private sector conducting threat intelligence was relatively new. After many years working in this area, I've compiled the text book that I wished I had had when starting out’.

A beloved Harvard Law professor. An early champion for slavery reparations. A voice for gender equality. A legendary public defender. A civil rights scholar. A lawyer for indigent clients. A lead counsel for Anita Hill during her testimony accusing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. A mentor to Michelle Robinson Obama ’88, Barack Obama ’91, and to hundreds of other African American lawyers. These are among the many tributes to Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr. ’78, affectionately known as “Tree,” that have been echoing across campus and in capitols, city halls, courthouses, and private conversations around the nation this week. Ogletree taught at Harvard Law School since 1984 and retired in 2020 after a diagnosis of early onset of Alzheimer’s disease. He died last Friday at age 70. During his time at the Law School, Ogletree founded the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice and the Criminal Justice Institute at Harvard Law School, and ran an informal “Saturday School,” where he mentored law students. We asked friends and colleagues in the Harvard community to reflect on how he will be remembered — and how they remember him. Charles Ogletree’s legacy is broad and deep, and there are many ways to characterize it. One can point to numerous professional achievements: acclaimed criminal defense lawyer, impassioned advocate of racial justice, visionary founder of both Harvard Law School’s Criminal Justice Institute and the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute. A devotion to building and sustaining community ran through these accomplishments, and I deeply appreciate this dimension of his legacy. Tree did not live only for himself. He gave of himself — his considerable intellect, his indefatigable energy, his generosity of spirit and empathetic personality — to fortify others. Tree had everyone’s backs; he saw the potential in everyone and sought to nurture it. The benefits of his commitment flowed, in particular, to Black Harvard students, many of whom, like Tree himself, the son of California tenant farmers, began life with many disadvantages. Hence, he mentored law students through Saturday School and invited his colleagues to join him. He taught leadership skills to student athletes through convenings of The Breakfast Club, alongside coach [Tommy] Amaker and Ron Sullivan. A pathbreaking member of the Harvard Law School faculty, he welcomed all who followed him. He took a particular interest in Black faculty; Tree made a point of inviting us to gather and connect over food and drink. I will never forget the warmth with which he greeted me when I joined the Law School faculty some 11 years ago; his smile crinkled the corners of his shining eyes. It is fitting that an endowed chair at Harvard Law School now bears his name; he deserves to be remembered and celebrated. May we all learn from Tree’s legacy of professional success, animated by service, and coupled with humility. You come across certain people in your life’s journey who leave an indelible mark. I was incredibly fortunate and blessed to have that happen with Harvard Law Professor Charles Ogletree. Tree and I became friends when I arrived at Harvard at a pivotal moment in my life. He did with me what he did with so many: make me bigger and better than I could imagine. Because of my relationship with Tree and his commitment to selfless service to others, I have always felt an obligation and a debt to “pay it forward” and to make him proud by bringing inspiration and opportunity to others. Among his many accomplishments, that will be his greatest legacy — his impact on others. We all owe him.

A group of faculty led by Jason Beckfield, the Robert G. Stone Jr. Professor of Sociology, gathered last week for the first of three pilot retreats organized by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Office of Undergraduate Education and the FAS Dean’s Office. The two-day brainstorm and professional development opportunity focused on developing curricula in the emerging field of Environmental Justice, or the convergence of environmental concerns with equity and civil rights. It’s an area of interest not only for Beckfield, a researcher known for his work on social stratification, population health, and climate change. “Our sense is that undergraduate students are increasingly interested in Environmental Justice specifically,” Beckfield said. The retreat brought together at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod six faculty members and two graduate students from across the FAS. Represented departments included anthropology, history, government, philosophy, and sociology. Tamarra James-Todd, the Mark and Catherine Winkler Associate Professor of Environmental Reproductive Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also joined the conversation. “She was the real expert on Environmental Justice in the room,” noted Beckfield, who also serves as associate director of the Chan School’s Center for Population and Development Studies. The agenda included guest speaker Hiʻilei Julia Kawehipuaakahaopulani Hobart, an assistant professor at Yale University with expertise in Indigenous Studies and food justice. According to Beckfield, “she gave an inspiring talk on how she thinks about her pedagogy in this space.” The 2022 Future of Climate Education at Harvard University report called for an all-hands-on-deck approach to expanding climate-focused offerings, with lines of inquiry that incorporate multiple disciplines. In response, the FAS Dean’s Office and Office of Undergraduate Education tapped Beckfield to put together its first Climate in the Curriculum faculty retreat. By then, Beckfield was already engaged in Environmental Justice conversations with Social Sciences Dean and W. E. B. Du Bois Professor of the Social Sciences Lawrence D. Bobo. The retreat yielded new approaches to classes, seminars, and cross-campus collaborations. As select ideas come to life, close observers will spot the Environmental Justice theme cropping up across newsletters, event listings, and the College course catalogue. Over the next two summers, the FAS Dean’s Office and Office of Undergraduate Education will fund more climate-focused retreats in off-campus settings that bring faculty closer to nature. “When you’re in a setting like Woods Hole,” Beckfield shared, “it’s a lot easier to stay focused on climate.” FAS faculty interested in leading or participating can learn more on the Office of Undergraduate Education webpage.

The emergence of AI-image generators, such as DALL-E 2, Discord, Midjourney, and others, has stirred a controversy over whether art generated by artificial intelligence should be considered real art — and whether it could put artists and creators out of work. The Gazette spoke with faculty who are involved in the production of art — a writer, a film animator, an architect, a musician, and a mixed-media artist — to ask them whether they see AI as a threat or a collaborator or a tool to further their own creativity and imagination. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity. I recently judged a story contest, and reading the shortlist was a clue to the challenges AI might encounter in creating good writing versus great. The best of these human-written stories surprised me with 1) unique ways of viewing the world (personality), 2) linguistic originality, 3) inimitable details that could come only from personal experience. Other stories were written deftly yet lacked these elements of originality and surprise. AI is a superb mimic and quick learner and might easily write strong works in recognizable modes, and with linguistic experimentation if prompted, but — I think — will lack true insight and experience. Most at risk are commercial genres with easily recognizable styles and tropes. Even something like autofiction with its ruminating first-person narrators is easily mimicked — but what will be missing, I’m guessing, is genuine vision from living in a specific physical world. When it comes to the performative aspect of music, artificial intelligence is not a concern to me. Music can transmit and represent emotion, and AI cannot do either of those things yet. And especially within jazz and creative music, music is in-the-moment composition, something that happens as musicians are collaborating onstage. That sense of interplay, or the ability to react in the moment, is something that artificial intelligence can’t reproduce because to do that requires being intelligent and having the agency to use your curiosity and your musical vocabulary. Only then, you can be able to react and create music in the moment. With regards to composition, we know that AI has been used to compose music for film and television for quite a few years. That is a concern because AI is doing the work that musicians used to do. But when you hear those compositions by AI, they lack surprise, emotion, and even silence. I love dramatism in music, and for me, emotion in music is important, and AI is not there yet. As for how music gets to people, this is where we have seen tremendous changes. The many music platforms we have, such as Spotify, YouTube, iTunes, etc., use algorithm-based features, and they make musical recommendations based on what you listen to. We all know that AI is behind it. Musicians would like to see algorithms suggest composers who are less known rather than those who are already popular. The new technology should democratize the field, make sure that people have access to things that are outside the mainstream, and learn to recognize musical traditions that are not only from the Western world. It’s important to welcome AI with open arms to try to understand what AI can do for us and work with it in creative ways. Any new technology is first seen as a threat to the status quo, like the way radio was received when it first aired. There have always been movements opposing those innovations. I don’t think AI is different, but we must remember that all these innovations are man-made, and as humans we can create and innovate. As a musician, I think we should open our eyes, ears, and arms to work with the new knowledge and innovation that AI can bring.

People who adhere to a Mediterranean lifestyle — which includes a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; healthy eating habits like limiting added salts and sugars; and habits promoting adequate rest, physical activity, and socialization — have a lower risk of all-cause and cancer mortality, according to a new study led by La Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. People who adhered to the lifestyle’s emphasis on rest, exercise, and socializing had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. The study was published today in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings. While many studies have established the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet and lifestyle, little research has been conducted on the diet outside of its region of origin. “This study suggests that it’s possible for non-Mediterranean populations to adopt the Mediterranean diet using locally available products and to adopt the overall Mediterranean lifestyle within their own cultural contexts,” said lead author Mercedes Sotos Prieto, Ramon y Cajal research fellow at La Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and adjunct assistant professor of environmental health at the Harvard Chan School. “We’re seeing the transferability of the lifestyle and its positive effects on health.” The researchers analyzed the habits of 110,799 members of the U.K. Biobank cohort, a population-based study across England, Wales, and Scotland using the Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index, which is derived from a lifestyle questionnaire and diet assessments. Participants, who were between the ages of 40 and 75, provided information about their lifestyles according to the three categories the index measures: 1.	“Mediterranean food consumption” (intake of foods included in the Mediterranean diet, such as fruits and whole grains); 2.	“Mediterranean dietary habits” (adherence to habits and practices around meals, including limiting salt and drinking healthy beverages); and 3.	“Physical activity, rest, and social habits and conviviality” (adherence to lifestyle habits including regular naps, exercising, and spending time with friends). Each item within the three categories was then scored, with higher total scores indicating closer adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle. The researchers followed up nine years later to examine participants’ health outcomes. Among the study population, 4,247 died from all causes; 2,401 from cancer; and 731 from cardiovascular disease. Analyzing these results alongside MEDLIFE scores, the researchers observed an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle and risk of mortality. Participants with higher MEDLIFE scores were found to have a 29 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 28 percent lower risk of cancer mortality compared with those with lower MEDLIFE scores. Adherence to each MEDLIFE category independently was associated with lower all-cause and cancer mortality risk. The “physical activity, rest, and social habits and conviviality” category was most strongly associated with these lowered risks, and additionally was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality.

Both President Biden and former president Donald J. Trump have announced their candidacies for the White House in the 2024 election. But recent polls show many Americans think Biden, 80, and Trump, who turned 77 in June, should not run again because they’re too old to serve another term. Many feel Biden lacks the mental sharpness or physical health to serve effectively as president again and give Trump the edge, according to another recent survey. Medical and political experts say such concerns about age have some validity generally, but individual cases can vary widely. And, they note, too many draw conclusions on fitness based on insignificant or unreliable indicators, an issue that will grow in significance as leaders are living longer and remaining in office — the current median age in the U.S. Senate is 65 and nearly 58 in the House. Alex Keyssar, Matthew W. Stirling Jr. Professor of History and Social Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, said Ronald Reagan’s age was widely seen as a flaw that Democrats tried to exploit when he ran for president in 1980 and 1984, but voters’ fixation on the age of both Democratic and Republican party front runners is new. With Biden and Trump as two of the three oldest to ever hold the office, age is a legitimate factor to weigh in the eyes of many voters. “I think age is also a surrogate for concern about illness and somebody dying in office,” said Keyssar. “It’s both: ‘Is this person capable of doing the job?’ and then, ‘Are they going to live to finish the job?’” Noting that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is older than Biden, faced little age criticism when he ran for president in 2016 at 75 and in 2020, at 79, Keyssar believes Democrats who cite age as a major election concern are probably really expressing “a desire for energetic leadership, a force for new ideas, new spirit, and new energy.” From the Right, painting Biden as physically and intellectually unfit for office has been a relentless political branding strategy since the 2020 primaries. Republican candidate Nikki Haley, 51, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under Trump, recently predicted Biden would not live long enough to complete a second term and has proposed mental competency tests for politicians over 75. So far, age and health have been less of a political Achilles’ heel for Trump than they have for Biden. Keyssar believes voters have other superseding concerns about Trump that render his age far less important. “People worry about what he represents and what he would do — and that would be true even if he was 10 years younger,” he said. While corporate America still sometimes requires senior executives to retire once they hit the mid-60s or early 70s, and top institutional leaders are rarely hired from this cohort, the Constitution has no age ceiling for presidents. That leaves prospective voters to apply their own standards in order to judge whether a candidate is still fit for the office. Assessing someone’s mental or physical fitness from brief observations of their speech, memory, or motor function, as voters seem to be doing with Biden and Trump, is highly unreliable. When it comes to cognitive acuity, things are much more complex, she said. Same with having trouble remembering names. The scientific literature shows name retrieval starts to get harder for most in the 30s and 40s, “so that’s just normal, and it may take you a little longer to retrieve the name,” she said. A more important metric is executive function, the kind of higher-order reasoning, problem-solving, and abstract thinking that allow us to plan, organize, and work through problems in real time. Also important is how well individuals function in their real-world environment, whether it’s a surgeon in the operating room or a president in the Oval Office, said Wong. In a recent TV interview, Biden touted his “wisdom” and “experience” as reasons voters should re-elect someone who will be 82 on Inauguration Day. Wong said there is some validity to the idea that with age comes wisdom. Physical health is an important influence on cognitive performance. People “don’t realize how much that influences cognitive functioning and cognitive abilities,” said Wong.

Is the globe’s thirst for oil finally topping out? A major international energy watcher says yes, predicting last month that demand for global oil for transport will peak around 2026, plateau for all uses by 2028, and possibly hit a zenith by the end of the decade. Harvard experts say the forecasts track with what’s going on in the developed world, where climate change concerns have fostered a push to electrify transportation, boost renewables, and reduce fossil fuels. But, they say, the energy needs of less-wealthy nations pressing to develop their economies could foil expectations for years to come. The International Energy Agency, established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in the 1970s to provide energy data and policy advice, predicted that demand for oil for transportation would peak in 2026 as a result of electric-vehicle (EV) adoption, biofuel growth, and improved fuel economy. It predicted increases in demand in all sectors would slow from 2.4 million barrels per day this year to just 0.4 million barrels per day in 2028, with a potential overall peak by 2030. Henry Lee, the Jassim M. Jaidah Family Director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Environmental and Natural Resource Program and senior lecturer in public policy, said despite many variables at play, he wouldn’t be surprised if the peak of oil use for transportation is achieved by 2026. Even if that proves too rosy, it’s still likely to be achieved by early in the next decade, he said. Lee said he’s been surprised at how quickly parts of the world are moving toward EV adoption. In China, the world’s largest auto market, electric vehicle sales in the first five months of 2023 were up by 26 percent. Sales by BYD Auto, China’s largest EV maker, are up 92 percent this year, he said. Likewise, American companies have poured resources into EV design and manufacturing. Both Ford and GM are planning to release new models in 2025, 2026, and 2027, Lee said, while Volkswagen, with new vehicles planned for 2026 and 2027, expects the majority of its fleet to be electric soon. “Ford and GM, driven by the California regulations, have invested billions of dollars in developing electric vehicles,” Lee said. “There is this huge investment, and it’s too late to change it.” Last August, officials in Sacramento declared that by 2035 all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the state — the nation’s largest auto market — must be electric or emission-free. But this momentum doesn’t mean the pieces are all in place, nor does it guarantee a smooth transition, Lee said. Significant hurdles remain regarding electricity pricing and building charging infrastructure. The cost to charge vehicles is artificially low, Lee said, which is alright for now because EVs are a small part of the market. But the situation will need to be fixed as more electric cars hit the road, and the solution is unclear. In addition considerable investment is still needed to ensure there will be sufficient charging stations, transmission lines, smart transformers, and energy storage, Lee said. Some of the necessary funds were approved in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but Lee said private investment seven or eight times greater is still needed. Automakers recognize this, and Ford and GM announced in June an agreement to adopt Tesla’s charging technology platform, which means their cars will be able to use Tesla’s nationwide network. Industrialized nations are using regulation and market forces to foster a shift away from fossil fuels, but the wild card for the IEA’s forecast involves the developing world, experts said. Globally, oil isn’t used heavily for electricity generation, but that’s less true in some developing nations where gasoline and diesel generators supplement small or unreliable grids and where liquified petroleum gas (LPG) is used for cooking, transport, and even heating. A 2014 study by the World Bank, for example, estimated that electricity demand in Nigeria was 8,000 to 10,000 megawatts, but just 3,500 of those came from the national electric grid. Much of the shortfall was made up by gasoline and diesel-powered generators, the report said.

Lassiter said he sees a disconnect between value systems in the developed and developing world, where an activity as mundane as cooking supper carries significant health consequences. According to the World Health Organization, the global death toll due to indoor air pollution — with cooking fires a major culprit — was estimated to be 3.2 million in 2020. “Rich countries can do what they choose to do. Poor countries do what they have to do,” Lassiter said. “And I think that poor countries have told us consistently that their objective is to deliver their citizens 365 by 7 by 24 energy in the form needed for their economies to develop and for the well-being of their citizens, now not tomorrow.” And that’s why, he says, fossil-fuel power plants and refineries will continue to be built, and coal, gasoline, LPG, and diesel used as fuels. And a peak for global oil demand will remain many years, if not decades, off, Lassiter predicts. “I will be very, very surprised if oil usage peaks in the foreseeable future, meaning a few decades from now,” he said. “There’s no reason to believe that the global South won’t take any barrel that’s produced anywhere in the world.” Lassiter, whose work focuses on nuclear plant development financing, said nuclear remains an option for relatively inexpensive, reliable, carbon-free power. Regulatory hurdles have all but closed the door to significant, rapid nuclear power plant expansion in the industrialized world, but the option remains potentially viable in the developing world, and comparatively inexpensive plants of Chinese and Korean design are available. Also the developing world’s transition to electric vehicles will be hampered by the fact that power infrastructure to homes is not as robust as in industrialized nations, which will make it harder for consumers to charge their cars, according to Lee. That will create yet another potential bind in the coming decades, Lee said, because many developing countries have no domestic automakers and so must import their cars from foreign manufacturers, which will be increasingly focused on producing electric models. While developing nations will play an important role in determining any potential peak in oil demand, that doesn’t have to mean those regions will be a roadblock in the global shift to renewables, according to Lauren Cohen, the L.E. Simmons Professor of Business Administration. The industrialized world, he said, doesn’t have a monopoly on energy innovation. “Fast-growing countries, such as China and India, along with dynamic and fast-developing regions of Southeast Asia and Africa, will be central determinants of coming decades’ energy balance,” Cohen said. “The great news is that many of these places are also developing healthy hubs of alternative energy innovation and experimentation for larger scale implementation.” Whenever the peak is reached, oil companies — some of the world’s wealthiest organizations — are unlikely to vanish from the global energy scene. Some will maintain a fossil-fuel focus, betting they can compete even in a shrinking market. Hardest hit will be mid-level oil producers without the financial cushion to endure a downturn or shift their business to alternatives. Some companies, though, are intent on remaining players even in an altered energy landscape and shouldn’t be counted out in the shift to greener sources. A recent study Cohen conducted showed them already playing a strong role in developing and filing patents for green technology. “These energy producers produce more — and significantly higher-quality — green innovation,” Cohen said. “In many green technology spaces, they appear to be first movers, not easily substitutable, and to produce ongoing foundational aspects of innovation on which other alternative energy innovators build.”

A Nobel Prize-winning chemist who identified the cause of the atmospheric ozone hole has called for new studies into air pollution in the world’s megacities, arguing that differing local conditions mean the world cannot rely on cookie-cutter solutions created in highly developed cities like Los Angeles and London. Mario Molina, who in the 1970s identified chlorofluorocarbons, widely used as refrigerants, as a threat to atmospheric ozone, used examples of efforts to curb pollution in Mexico City and Beijing to highlight his contention that new knowledge and fresh policy solutions are needed to address the thick, sickening smog that obscures the urban air there. In Beijing, Molina said, steps to reduce sulfur dioxide have been successful in cutting levels of the pollutant, but not in clearing the air. The reason, he said, has been highlighted by laboratory studies that show that, in addition to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ammonia are precursor chemicals in a complex chain of reactions that result in smog. In Mexico City, he said government efforts to curb the air pollution that regularly obscures views of the surrounding mountains have also been ineffective, because they don’t fully take into account local cultures and customs. A program to ban cars from driving on high-pollution days resulted in people buying second cars — often older and more polluting — so they could still get to work. Molina, distinguished professor at the University of California at San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1995, with F. Sherwood Rowland and Paul J. Crutzen, for his work on chlorofluorocarbons and atmospheric ozone.  Molina and Rowland’s 1974 paper in Nature highlighted the threat to ozone high in the stratosphere, which shields the Earth from cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. Resulting national regulation and 1987’s Montreal Protocol, ratified by 197 counties, have phased out the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons. In recent years, observations have shown that the Antarctic ozone hole is beginning to close. The protocol, meanwhile, has been hailed as a model of an international agreement to meet global environmental threats. Molina spoke to a standing-room-only crowd in Harvard’s Science Center on Wednesday evening. He was introduced by Michael McElroy, Gilbert Butler Professor of Environmental Studies and head of the Harvard-China Project. The event was sponsored by the China Project, the Harvard University Center for the Environment, the Harvard Global Institute, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Department of Environmental Health. Molina, who grew up in Mexico City, said he remembers seeing the mountains surrounding the city regularly when he was young. The air pollution that obscures them today is largely due to population increases — Mexico City has expanded 20-fold since 1900, to more than 20 million people — and the emissions that come with that, he said. Mexico City has fought pollution by following Los Angeles’ model and focusing mainly on ozone, whose levels have been reduced with some success. The effort has not done much, however, to reduce particulates, which have been proven to be harmful to human health, and traffic congestion hasn’t declined. Molina called for improvements in public transportation as a way to cut pollution from automobiles. Part of the difficulty in encouraging people to leave their cars home has to do with a lack of viable alternatives, he said. It’s important that more research be done on both the science and policy fronts, he said. Answers found in Mexico could help developing cities in China and elsewhere, and vice versa, he said. “We have to do our own work,” Molina said. “We don’t have all the answers.” He expressed concern that the United States appears closer to taking the “business as usual” path of increasing carbon dioxide emissions rather than making the cuts needed to avoid dangerous global temperature increases. He said that estimates of global temperatures climbing 4 to 5 degrees Celsius by 2100 include enough uncertainty that there is a one-in-five chance that the actual rise would top 7 degrees Celsius, or 12 degrees Fahrenheit. That could cause catastrophic changes whose solutions would be pushed off onto our grandchildren.

In a trio of studies published earlier this month, researchers at the Energy Frontier Research Center’s (EFRC) Integrated Mesoscale Architectures for Sustainable Catalysis (IMASC) at Harvard have shown that the process of catalysis is more dynamic than previously imagined, and that molecular forces can vastly influence the process. The first, published in Nature Materials, showed that contrary to the way the process was long believed to happen, catalysts are capable of restructuring their surfaces during reactions, and then returning to their normal state. Catalysts have been a fundamental part of modern industrial processes for more than a century, but the development of new catalysts to speed up chemical processes has remained inconsistent. To more fully understand precisely how the catalysts work, and to aid in the development of new catalytic materials, Cynthia Friend, director of IMASC, the Theodore William Richards Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Materials Science, and colleagues from the Lawrence Berkley (LBNL), Brookhaven (BNL), and Lawrence Livermore (LLNL) national laboratories set out to observe the process of catalysis as it happens. Cutting-edge scientific tools yielded images of the atoms in the material and monitored how the composition of the catalyst surface changes. Microscopy facilities at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven and the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley were essential for these experiments. Two additional studies — one described in Nature Communications and the other in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) — detail a second discovery, that previously ignored molecular forces have a significant effect on how compounds react during catalysis. Taken together, the discoveries represent an entirely new understanding of how catalysis takes place, and offer a possible roadmap for the design and development of a new generation of energy-efficient catalysts for a host of industrial processes. Conducted in collaboration with colleagues at several national laboratories and other partnering institutions, researchers at the DOE-funded IMASC are combining tightly controlled experimental conditions and computational tools to develop new methods for developing catalysts and new ways to understand the process of catalysis. “This is really a paradigm shift in catalyst discovery,” Friend said. “For 100 years or more, this was a trial-and-error process. In recent years, people are striving for a more systematic approach. Our center, through synergistic collaboration between the investigators from the partnering institutions, is establishing new principles for understanding catalytic reactions under very tightly controlled conditions, with computational modeling. These principles are used to develop catalysts that work under real-world conditions.” Nearly one-third of the world’s energy is devoted to the chemical industry, said Challa S.S.R. Kumar, the program’s managing director, so finding ways to make those processes more efficient — either by speeding them up or allowing them to take place at lower temperatures — could make for a significant environmental impact. “Our goal has been to develop a new paradigm for catalyst discovery,” said Kumar. “We can now say we have new design principles that have never been thought about before in catalysis.” The first of those principles, he said, is the notion that catalysts are able to dynamically rearrange the atoms on their surface to drive certain reactions. Friend and colleagues found that while catalysis may occur under a range of conditions, at certain temperatures and pressures, catalysts are able to dynamically rearrange the atoms on their surface to drive certain reactions, and then return to their normal state. “This is a critical discovery in catalysis, because so far, the mindset has been to simply design a catalyst’s surface,” she said. “But what we’re saying is you need to go a step further and … take that dynamic nature into consideration when designing a catalyst. As described in Nature Communications and JACS, researchers found evidence that tiny molecular forces which long had been ignored play a critical role in why different molecules react differently during catalysis. “What we are now seeing is that these forces called van der Waals forces … even though they’re tiny, they contribute to controlling the activity and selectivity of the reaction,” Friend said. “So now we can understand why we see reactivity differences between closely related compounds.” “This is a whole new way of looking at things,” he said. “We have demonstrated these design principles in one case, but our goal is to develop and design catalysts and methods for catalyst design that can be widely applied. We want to be generally applicable to a variety of catalysts and catalytic reactions.”

The key to working better, sleeping better, and feeling better could be rooted in the design, maintenance, and operation of the buildings where we spend the majority of our time, a new Harvard study has found. The national study, conducted by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Health and the Global Environment (CHGE) and SUNY Upstate Medical, is the first to show that working in high-performing, green-certified buildings can improve employee decision-making using objective cognitive simulations. Researchers looked at 10 high-performing buildings in five cities across the United States, including Harvard’s double LEED Platinum Blackstone South building. The team collaborated with the Office for Sustainability (OFS) and Harvard Real Estate to use Blackstone as a “living laboratory” to study the relationship between building conditions and occupants’ productivity and well-being. The study found that occupants in high-performing, green-certified office environments scored 26 percent higher on tests of cognitive function, had 30 percent fewer symptoms of sick building syndrome, and had 6 percent higher sleep quality scores than those in high-performing but noncertified buildings. In addition to the overall effect from being in a better building, several specific factors were found to have impacts on participants’ cognitive function scores. The high-performing, green-certified buildings used in the study had environments more frequently within the thermal comfort zone defined by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) organization, which resulted in 5.4 percent higher cognitive function scores. Brighter, blue-enriched lighting, such as daylighting, in the green-certified buildings was also associated with better sleep quality at night, which in turn led to better cognitive performance the following day. This finding supports research showing the impacts of lighting on circadian rhythm; a bigger contrast in daytime and nighttime light exposures can help regulate the release of melatonin, the hormone responsible for inducing sleep. “Our goal is to improve the health of all people, in all buildings, everywhere, every day. To do this we are merging building science with health science and advocating for what we call ‘buildingomics’ — a new approach that examines the totality of factors in the building-related environment that influence human health, well-being, and productivity,” said Joseph Allen, assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and principal investigator of the Healthy Buildings program at the Harvard Center for Health and the Global Environment. “We are passionate about moving science out of public health journals and into the hands of decision-makers, so we developed ‘The 9 Foundations of a Healthy Building,’ a concise synthesis of 30 years of scientific data on the key elements that make buildings healthy.” The research grew out of the team’s previous COGfx Study, which found cognitive function scores doubled when participants were in simulated green building environments with enhanced ventilation compared to environments representative of conventional buildings. For this study, the team built on those results by going from the lab to real building environments, concluding that even in buildings that have high ventilation rates and low chemical concentration, there are additional benefits of green certification, and factors such as lighting and thermal conditions, which may improve the work and health of occupants. In related research, CHGE recently received the inaugural grant from the Office for Sustainability’s new Campus Sustainability Innovation Fund to study and quantify the health impacts of biophilic design, the concept of introducing nature into the built environment. The team will use the grant to fund a mobile virtual reality lab to simulate exposure to indoor environments, and to recruit student and staff participants to monitor in the lab and in Harvard buildings with varying levels of natural elements. The fund is part of Harvard’s reinvigorated “living lab” initiative, which encourages and supports projects that use the campus as a test site for developing solutions that enhance well-being and mitigate climate impact, or help neighboring communities tackle these problems. As part of this effort, OFS and CHGE are engaged in a multiyear partnership to use campus spaces to inform public health research and apply the find

Sometimes a memorable lesson floats right into the classroom. Case in point: John Collins’ world-record paper airplane. On Wednesday, Collins brought his high-achieving design — along with enthusiasm and a couple of boxes of planes — to the Graduate School of Design (GSD). Collins, whose plane set the 226-foot record for distance in 2012, offered a workshop that used paper airplanes as a teaching tool. He talked to a group of students about making the planes, including design, goals, and materials. As he outlined the process, he encouraged students to engage in behavior that would have gotten their high school selves sent to the principal’s office: making and flying paper airplanes in class. “When thinking about design solutions, it has to work,” Collins said. “If you can wad up a piece of paper and throw it farther than your paper airplane, your plane sucks.” Collins’ talk touched on glide ratios, center of gravity, and center of lift, the boundary layer, and the Magnus effect. He drew on his experience with origami to introduce students to the complicated folds of their first plane, which had a thick hexagonal front. He talked about how an additional fold here or there can shift the center of gravity and make a plane fly better, or how a tweak of a wing’s trailing edge can prevent a nosedive. Along the way, he offered an inside view of the process behind designing 75 original planes. The workshop and previous night’s lecture at Gund Hall were part of the new Master in Design Engineering (MDE) program offered jointly by the GSD and the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). “My goal was to bring an outside-the-box thinker with a nontraditional path to speak to our students,” said Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics Kevin Kit Parker, who arranged Collins’ visit. “Innovation comes in many different forms, not just through formal education. But before innovation one must live a creative life. John certainly lives a creative life.” Martin Bechthold, Kumagai Professor of Architectural Technology and MDE co-director, said the program is intended to train students to analyze and solve problems that span an array of disciplines and whose scale ranges from the global to the individual. One challenge, he said, is that data on these kinds of problems are often hard to find. During their two years of study, students will work in multidisciplinary teams in which collaboration will be key to success, Bechtold said. Collins, a former television producer and director whose childhood passion for paper airplanes never faded, set the world record by taking a different approach from the previous champion, who flew a version of the basic dart that every kid knows how to make. Rather than the dart’s brute-force approach, Collins aimed for just the right float. In a conversation after the classroom session, Collins shared one of the most important lessons from his achievement: You may fail on any given attempt, but you’re never defeated until you quit. He also offered a pointer to paper plane aficionados frustrated by planes that don’t fly right: Don’t fold another; tweak the plane you have. “Treat every flight like a test flight, observe what it’s doing,” Collins said. “You can take a poorly folded plane and make it fly OK.” During the workshop, students made three different flying forms: a plane, a flying ring, and a tumbling wing that spins as it floats on the updraft from a rectangular piece of cardboard moving at walking speed. Grad student Seungkuk Ahn said it was interesting to take a scientific approach to such a simple-seeming problem. “This is really fun, we learned a lot of design criteria with ease,” Ahn said. “The best way to learn is in person.”

No one who has ever worried about toxic chemicals in the everyday environment would have had his or her fears allayed by attending the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health forum “Hormone-Altering Chemicals: Fertility and Health Implications.” Presented jointly with the Huffington Post, whose senior living editor, Erin Schumaker, was the moderator, the panel focused on chemicals that affect the endocrine system, and their effects on fertility and childbirth. But the central point of the talk was contained in four words, screened in a video by the Environmental Working Group: “Toxic chemicals are everywhere.” The panel opened Tuesday afternoon with some sobering statistics: Everyday products —personal hygiene products, medications, food packaging, objects such as window blinds — contain more than 10,000 chemicals that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and many of them are banned in China and the European Union. Russ Hauser, acting chair of the Department of Environmental Health at the Harvard Chan School, said many of these chemicals are endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with common metabolism, the immune system, and fertility in men and women. “Our exposure may be at very low levels,” he noted. “But there is data suggesting that even that can have an effect on humans.” Tamarra James-Todd, professor of environmental reproductive and perinatal epidemiology at the Harvard Chan School, added that certain populations — including pregnant women and minorities — are especially at risk. She said chemicals used in cosmetics and industrial products are related to glucose disruption, which can lead to Type II diabetes that pregnant women can pass on to their children. Another vulnerable group is teenage women, said Nneka Leiba, deputy director of research for the Environmental Working Group. That’s partly because teens tend to use more cosmetics and other personal products than adult women, she said. “We tested for 25 chemicals in teenage girls and found that 16 of them were present, and these were the ones associated with endocrine disruption. And what’s going on during adolescence? There’s complicated hormonal signaling that guides development of the brain and the immune system.” Even if teens don’t use those personal products, they may encounter the same chemicals through waterproof clothing or nonstick cookware. “It really is ubiquitous.” Speaking via Skype from Europe, Pete Myers, CEO and chief scientist of Environmental Health Sciences, focused on the obstacles to effective regulation. Myers, who has been working on the issue since the ’80s, emphasized that endocrine-disrupting chemicals are a recognized danger, classified by the World Health Organization as a global health threat. Yet they aren’t regulated in the United States as such. “There are many reasons regulation has advanced slowly, but the big one is money,” he said. “If regulators were to act on the science we have in hand now, it would require multiple products to be taken off the market. There are games that people play to make that not happen. The money [generated by those products] pays for a lot of lawyers. We face a system that makes the movement of science into regulation move very slowly, and in some cases backwards.” Still, consumers aren’t entirely powerless. Leiba’s organization, the Environmental Working Group, maintains a database of products that are rated for their chemical safety. And she noted a positive sign in last year’s rewriting of the Toxic Substances Control Act, which was introduced in the ’70s and was badly in need of an update. In 2016, it was expanded to give more regulatory power to the Environmental Protection Agency, but Schumaker pointed out that the Act’s future is uncertain under the new president. Leiba said that the Senate’s recent approval of Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA may not be a good sign, since Pruitt fought against regulations on toxic emissions when he was attorney general of Oklahoma. All four panelists agreed that the one thing that was most needed was stronger government regulation, but nobody seemed optimistic it would be coming anytime soon. “What I’d look for,” Myers said, “is a package of policies that move us into a world in which moms don’t have to be chemical engineers to go shopping for their kids.”

When most people hear the word psychopath, they immediately think of a Hannibal Lecter–style serial killer who is cold, calculating, emotionless, willing to do or say anything to get their desire. And they’re not alone. For decades, researchers studying psychopathy have characterized the disorder as a profound inability to process emotions such as empathy, remorse, or regret. A recent study, though, suggests that psychopaths are not incapable of feeling emotions like regret and disappointment. What they cannot do, it seems, is make accurate predictions about the outcomes of their choices. The study, co-authored by Joshua Buckholtz, associate professor of psychology at Harvard, and Arielle Baskin-Sommers, assistant professor of psychology and of psychiatry at Yale University, offers a new model of the disorder that could shed important light on the decision-making process of psychopaths. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “The assumption has always been that they make these bad choices because they can’t generate negative emotions like fear, or appropriately respond to emotional signals generated by other people … but we turned that idea on its head.” Using an economic game, Buckholtz and Baskin-Sommers were able to show that while psychopaths have normal, or even enhanced, emotional responses in situations that typically elicit regret, they have trouble extracting information from the environment that would indicate that an action they’re about to take will result in the experience of regret. “There are two components to regret,” Buckholtz explained. “There is retrospective regret, which is how we usually think about regret — the emotional experience after you learn you could have received a better outcome if you had made a different choice. But we also use signals from our environment to make predictions about which actions will or won’t result in regret. What differentiated psychopaths from other people was their inability to use those prospective regret signals, to use information about the choices they were given to anticipate how much regret they were going to experience, and adjust their decision-making accordingly. “It’s almost like a blindness to future regret,” he added. “When something happens, they feel regret, but what they can’t do is look forward and use information that would tell them they’re going to feel regret to guide their decision-making.” “These findings highlight that psychopathic individuals are not simply incapable of regret [or other emotions], but that there is a more nuanced dysfunction that gets in the way of their adaptive functioning,” Baskin-Sommers said. “By appreciating this complexity, we are poised to develop more accurate methods for predicting the costly behavior of psychopathic individuals.” Using a measure of prospective regret sensitivity, Buckholtz and Baskin-Sommers were also able to predict whether and even how many times study participants had been incarcerated. “Contrary to what you would expect based on these basic emotional-deficit models, their emotional responses to regret didn’t predict incarceration,” Buckholtz said. “We know psychopathy is one of the biggest predictors of criminal behavior, but what we found was that behavioral regret sensitivity moderated that, raising the suggestion that intact behavioral regret sensitivity could be a protective factor against incarceration in psychopathic individuals.” While the study upends the pop-culture image of psychopaths, Buckholtz is hopeful that it will also provide a new direction for scientists who hope to understand how psychopaths make decisions. “We actually know very little about how psychopaths make choices,” he said. “There have been all sorts of research into their emotions and emotional experience, but we know next to nothing about how they integrate information that we extract from the world as a matter of course and use it to make decisions in daily lives. Getting better insight into why psychopaths make such terrible choices, I think, is going to be very important for the next generation of psychopathy research.”

The Harvard University strategic initiative HarvardX is running a massive open online course (MOOC) that features adaptive learning and assessment algorithms that tailor course material in response to student performance. “Adaptive learning functionality,” through which a computer system can fit learning experiences to the needs of each student, had not been offered previously in a HarvardX course and is featured in a few courses across the edX online learning platform. But it is being used in “Super-Earths and Life,” taught by Harvard’s Phillips Professor of Astronomy Dimitar Sasselov. The presentation is designed to gain a preliminary assessment of the technological feasibility and implications of adaptive functionality to online course design. “Adaptive learning programs are very good at speeding up information acquisition and lengthening retention, as well as individualizing learning to help learners see where they have difficulty,” said Peter K. Bol, Harvard’s vice provost for advances in learning (VPAL) and Charles H. Carswell Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations. According to Robert A. Lue, HarvardX faculty director and professor of the practice of molecular and cellular biology, digital content when used properly can respond faster than a classroom instructor. “One of the big advantages of learning in the digital space is the ability to get real-time feedback,” he said. “Adaptive functionality allows users to optimize learning based on their performance, offering a personalized path to mastery.” And, as VPAL research faculty director and Harvard Government Professor Dustin Tingley said, the possibilities of adaptive learning go beyond simple multiple-choice questions. For instance, it can figure out where a student’s strengths lie and adjust the material accordingly. “The idea is to tailor the experience so that students are more likely to get what they need,” said Tingley. “The broader mission is to make sure that students are really benefiting from the online learning experience.” VPAL researchers and HarvardX technologists collaborated with educational technology company TutorGen to implement an adaptive learning algorithm within a subset of “Super-Earths and Life” content. VPAL researchers leveraged the existing algorithm to build out, in-house, an adaptive learning technology to use within a HarvardX course in different ways. “Super-Earths” users were evenly divided into experimental and control groups. On course homework pages, control group learners received a predetermined, non-adaptive set of problems of varying difficulty (easy, medium, and hard). The experimental group received the same assessments, but its problems were served sequentially, one by one, in an order based on prior performance. Given a wrong answer, the assessment provides an easier follow-up question; given a right answer, it serves up a more difficult one. The adaptive algorithm estimates the user’s mastery of a learning objective each time he or she answers a problem tagged with the objective (even if the problem is outside the adaptive assessments). If the problem is advanced, the engine serves the instructional system advanced materials covering the necessary learning objectives, providing students with an option to study these before attempting the problem. Students in the control group also have access to these materials in an optional part of the course. Ideally, students will progress to the harder material at their own pace. More importantly, the technology could help prevent students from feeling daunted and dropping out before completing the course. Preliminary results suggest that the adaptive algorithm is helping foster efficient learning in “Super-Earths.” In an effort to examine the effect of adaptive technology on learner performance, engagement, and completion in online courses, VPAL research analyzed “Super-Earths” course data between the course’s launch in mid-October and the first week of January. Differences in learner efficiency and performance, on average, were noted in the adaptive experimental group in a number of key areas. The adaptive group moved faster through the course materials, showing a lower net time on task (4.37 hours) than the control group (4.80). The adaptive group also showed more persistence in course assessments (making 2.99 attempts per advanced problem, compared with the control group’s 2.41 attempts per advanced problem), while attempting fewer problems overall (3.99) than the control group (5.42). Overall, the experimental group outperformed learners in the control group by achieving a 19 percent larger knowledge gain after completing adaptive assessments, compared with non-adaptive settings in the control group. VPAL research and HarvardX plan to expand adaptive learning functionality in future HarvardX courses and further explore how the technology can improve online learning outcomes.

As you watch, the jaguar fades to black. Also the monkey next to it, the antelope, the grizzly bear, the wild dog, the Siberian tiger. Look around the darkened room and you’ll find other animals fading or already gone: the heath hen, extinct in 1932; the great auk, last seen in 1844; and New Zealand’s flightless moa, which survived only a few hundred years after humanity’s arrival just before 1300. The specimens of threatened, endangered, and extinct species — all from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) — are part of a new exhibit at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). “Next of Kin: Seeing Extinction through the Artist’s Lens,” was created by visual artist Christina Seely in collaboration with the Canary Project, which produces art and media on ecological issues. Supported by a gift from 1968 Harvard Business School graduate Clark Bernard and Susana Bernard, Seely drew from the MCZ’s vast collections, which encompass some 21 million specimens, including many species considered threatened, endangered, or extinct. The exhibit runs through June 4. Jane Pickering, executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, of which the HMNH is part, said during a reception last month that the exhibit is a departure for the museum, which typically features scientists’ views of scientific topics. “This is something that’s a bit different, a bit of an experiment, and not all experiments work,” Pickering said. “I think in this case it really did.” Species extinction and reductions in biodiversity have been increasing rapidly over the last two centuries. It remains to be seen whether today’s human-driven crisis will rival past global mass extinctions, as some have warned, but the trends are worrisome, said MCZ director James Hanken, the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology. “The rate at which species are being lost today is extremely high and much higher than 100 years ago, 200 years ago,” Hanken said. “If things continue unabated, the world, including the U.S., will be very different in 150 years from what we see around us today.” When the MCZ was founded in 1859, Hanken said, few scientists were concerned about extinction and biodiversity loss. Now most are, and part of the museum’s mission is to educate the public and policymakers on urgent scientific issues. An artist’s perspective helps the museum accomplish that goal, Hanken said. “Scientists go about it [education] with charts and graphs and hard facts,” he said. “It’s not terribly effective, not enough to change the [public] consciousness. Artists have a different way to approach a problem. They appeal on a gut level, an emotional level.” Seely became interested in extinction during a trip to photograph animals in the Arctic. A year ago, after a conversation with Pickering, she began working with faculty-curators of the MCZ’s mammal and bird collections to identify specimens to include in the exhibit, which opened a week before Christmas. A visitor sees clear display cases lit to stand out in the darkness. One holds brown boxes of great auk bones — a box of skulls, a box of ribs, a box of spines — reflecting the bird’s onetime abundance across the North Atlantic. Nearby a single heath hen egg lies in a large bed of white cotton, which Seely said shows the care with which eggs are packed away in the collection. The last heath hen was a male on Martha’s Vineyard. Another eye-catching display features several large photographs of endangered or threatened animals. Arranged along two walls, the images, like the creatures themselves, fade from view as a visitor watches. The exhibit also includes the ear of a sei whale, a narwhal tusk, and the moa. Seely said she’s hoping an artist’s touch might help spread awareness on important scientific topics. “I’m interested in figuring out ways to get the general public connected in a deeper way to what’s happening.”

Nearly a century after it was theorized, Harvard scientists report they have succeeded in creating the rarest material on the planet, which could eventually develop into one of its most valuable. Thomas D. Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences Isaac Silvera and postdoctoral fellow Ranga Dias have long sought the material, called atomic metallic hydrogen. In addition to helping scientists answer some fundamental questions about the nature of matter, the material is theorized to have a wide range of applications, including as a room-temperature superconductor. Their research is described in a paper published today in Science. “This is the Holy Grail of high-pressure physics,” Silvera said of the quest to find the material. “It’s the first-ever sample of metallic hydrogen on Earth, so when you’re looking at it, you’re looking at something that’s never existed before.” In their experiments, Silvera and Dias squeezed a tiny hydrogen sample at 495 gigapascal (GPa), or more than 71.7 million pounds per square inch, which is greater than the pressure at the center of the Earth. At such extreme pressures, Silvera explained, solid molecular hydrogen, which consists of molecules on the lattice sites of the solid, breaks down, and the tightly bound molecules dissociate to transforms into atomic hydrogen, which is a metal. While the work creates an important window into understanding the general properties of hydrogen, it also offers tantalizing hints at potentially revolutionary new materials. “One prediction that’s very important is metallic hydrogen is predicted to be meta-stable,” Silvera said. “That means if you take the pressure off, it will stay metallic, similar to the way diamonds form from graphite under intense heat and pressure, but remain diamonds when that pressure and heat are removed.” Understanding whether the material is stable is important, Silvera said, because predictions suggest metallic hydrogen could act as a superconductor at room temperatures. A room temperature superconductor, Dias said, could change our transportation system, making magnetic levitation of high-speed trains possible, as well as making electric cars more efficient and improving the performance of many electronic devices. The material could also provide major improvements in energy production and storage. Because superconductors have zero resistance, superconducting coils could be used to store excess energy, which could then be used whenever it is needed. Metallic hydrogen could also play a key role in helping humans explore the far reaches of space, as a more powerful rocket propellant. “It takes a tremendous amount of energy to make metallic hydrogen,” Silvera explained. “And if you convert it back to molecular hydrogen, all that energy is released, so that would make it the most powerful rocket propellant known to man, and could revolutionize rocketry.” The most powerful fuels in use today are characterized by a “specific impulse” (a measure, in seconds, of how fast a propellant is fired from the back of a rocket) of 450 seconds. The specific impulse for metallic hydrogen, by comparison, is theorized to be 1,700 seconds. “That would easily allow you to explore the outer planets,” Silvera said. “We would be able to put rockets into orbit with only one stage, versus two, and could send up larger payloads, so it could be very important.” In their experiments, Silvera and Dias turned to one of the hardest materials on Earth, diamond. But rather than natural diamond, Silvera and Dias used two small pieces of carefully polished synthetic diamond and treated them to make them even tougher. Then they mounted them opposite each other in a device known as a diamond anvil cell. “Diamonds are polished with diamond powder, and that can gouge out carbon from the surface,” Silvera said. “When we looked at the diamond using atomic force microscopy, we found defects, which could cause it to weaken and break.” The solution, he said, was to use a reactive ion etching process to shave a tiny layer — just five microns thick, or about a tenth the thickness of a human hair — from the diamond’s surface. The diamond was then coated with a thin layer of alumina to prevent the hydrogen from diffusing into the crystal structure and embrittling it. After more than four decades of work on metallic hydrogen, and nearly a century after it was first theorized, it was thrilling to see the results, Silvera said.

Harvard University and Boston Children’s Hospital researchers have developed a customizable soft robot that fits around the heart and helps it beat, potentially opening new treatment options for people suffering from heart failure. The soft robotic sleeve twists and compresses in synch with a beating heart, augmenting cardiovascular functions weakened by heart failure. Unlike currently available devices that assist heart function, Harvard’s soft robotic sleeve does not directly contact blood. This reduces the risk of clotting and eliminates the need for a patient to take potentially dangerous blood thinner medications. “This research demonstrates that the growing field of soft robotics can be applied to clinical needs and potentially reduce the burden of heart disease and improve the quality of life for patients,” said Ellen T. Roche, the paper’s first author and a former Ph.D. student at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Wyss Institute of Biologically Inspired Engineering. Roche is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Ireland. “This work represents an exciting proof-of-concept result for this soft robot, demonstrating that it can safely interact with soft tissue and lead to improvements in cardiac function. We envision many other future applications where such devices can delivery mechanotherapy both inside and outside of the body,” said Conor Walsh, senior author of the paper, John L. Loeb Associate Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences at SEAS, and core faculty member at the Wyss Institute. Heart failure affects 41 million people worldwide. Today, some of the treatment options are mechanical pumps called ventricular assist devices (VADs), which pump blood from the ventricles into the aorta, and heart transplants. While VADs are continuously improving, patients are still at high risk for blood clots and stroke. To create an entirely new device that doesn’t come into contact with blood, Harvard researchers took inspiration from the heart itself. The thin silicone sleeve uses soft pneumatic actuators placed around the heart to mimic the outer muscle layers of the mammalian heart. The actuators twist and compress the sleeve in a motion similar to the beating heart. The sleeve can be customized for each patient, said Roche. If a patient has more weakness on the left side of the heart, for example, the actuators can be tuned to give more assistance there. The pressure of the actuators can also increase or decrease over time, as the patient’s condition evolves. The sleeve is attached to the heart using a combination of a suction device, sutures, and a gel interface to help with friction between the device and the heart. The SEAS and Wyss engineers worked with surgeons at Boston Children’s Hospital to develop the device and determine the best ways to implant and test it on animal models. “The cardiac field had turned away from idea of developing heart compression instead of blood-pumping VADs due to technological limitations, but now with advancements in soft robotics it’s time to turn back,” said Frank Pigula, a cardiothoracic surgeon and co-corresponding author on the study, who was formerly clinical director of pediatric cardiac surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital and is now a faculty member at the University of Louisville and division chief of pediatric cardiac surgery at Norton Children’s Hospital. More research needs to be done before the sleeve can be implanted in humans, but the research is an important first step toward an implantable soft robot that can augment organ function. “This research is really significant at the moment because more and more people are surviving heart attacks and ending up with heart failure,” said Roche. “Soft robotic devices are ideally suited to interact with soft tissue and give assistance that can help with augmentation of function, and potentially even healing and recovery.” The research was co-authored by Markus A. Horvath, Isaac Wamala, Ali Alazmani, Sang-Eun Song, William Whyte, Zurab Machaidze, Christopher J. Payne, James Weaver, Gregory Fishbein, Joseph Kuebler, Nikolay V.Vasilyev, and David J. Mooney.

When Margaret Morris looks around her physics class, sometimes she is the only woman there. Morris, a senior at Brandeis University, is living the reality for physics in the United States. At a time when women make up the majority of the country’s college students, their numbers still trail male peers in certain fields. And in some disciplines, like physics, women remain a small minority. Last weekend, 250 physics majors gathered at Harvard to take a collective step toward a new reality. The Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics included lab tours, lectures, personal stories, and practical discussions about research, graduate school applications, how to deal with discrimination and implicit bias, and finding mentors. Organizer Anne Hebert, a Harvard grad student, said the conference was designed to connect participants with a support network that will help them move ahead in the field. “As an undergraduate, obviously I noticed there weren’t many girls around,” Hebert said. “Every girl in physics has a moment when they turn their head and realize they’re the only girl in the room.” One of her fellow organizers, Ellen Klein, a Harvard doctoral student, said that as an undergrad at Yale University, she felt supported by faculty members and never experienced blatant gender discrimination. But she has noticed that there have been fewer women as she’s advanced through different academic levels. Delilah Gates, also an organizing committee member and Harvard doctoral student, agreed with Klein and Hebert that bias, though often subtle, is still a problem. All three have heard male classmates joke about women and understood in a visceral way that, though real progress has been made, plenty of work remains. Gates added that as a black woman, she felt a lot of pressure in college to show that her opportunities weren’t handed to her because of race, leaving her temporarily conflicted about applying to graduate school. “In college, I kind of didn’t anticipate it. I was struck by the pressure I felt because of being an African-American woman and [proving] that no one was handing it to me because I check off a diversity box,” Gates said. The campus conference, organized through the American Physical Society, was one of 10 that took place across the United States and Canada and the first to be hosted by Harvard. Some 1,500 women attended a session somewhere, Hebert said. A workshop titled SPIN UP, for Supporting Inclusion for Underrepresented Peoples, preceded the Harvard conference. The event was aimed at other underrepresented groups in the field, including minorities, students with disabilities, and students from low-income families. Physics helps solve problems facing humanity, said Masahiro Morii, chair of Harvard’s Physics Department, which provided logistical support for the student-run conference. And, though women make up half the population, they still make up less than 25 percent of physics graduate students

They have been a fundamental part of modern industry for more than a century, but the development of new catalysts to speed chemical processes has remained frustratingly hit-or-miss. Now, a group of Harvard researchers is approaching the problem in an entirely new way. Working with colleagues at several national laboratories and other partnering institutions, researchers at the Department of Energy-funded Energy Frontier Research Center’s Integrated Mesoscale Architectures for Sustainable Catalysis (IMASC) at Harvard are combining tightly-controlled experimental conditions and computational tools to develop novel methods for developing catalysts and new ways to understand the process of catalysis. Led by Cynthia Friend, the Theodore William Richards Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Materials Science and director of the Rowland Institute, the IMASC researchers have gained new insight into exactly how catalysis works — findings that could play an important role in the design and development of more energy-efficient catalysts. The work is described in a Dec. 19 paper published in Nature Materials. “This is really a paradigm shift in catalyst discovery,” Challa S.S.R. Kumar, the program’s managing director, said. “For 100 years or more, this was a trial-and-error process. In recent years, people are striving for a more systematic approach. Our center, through synergistic collaboration between the investigators from the partnering institutions, is establishing new principles for understanding catalytic reactions under very tightly controlled conditions, with computational modeling. These principles are used to develop catalysts that work under real-world conditions.” With those principles in mind, researchers are currently exploring the use of nanoporous silver-gold alloys as improved catalysts. “These catalyst materials are designed based on our model systems,” Kumar said. To aid in the development of catalytic materials, Friend and colleagues from the Lawrence Berkeley, Brookhaven, and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories set out to observe the process of catalysis as it happens. Cutting-edge scientific tools yielded images of the atoms in the material and monitored how the composition of the catalyst surface changed. Microscopy facilities at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven and the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley were essential for these experiments. “We know we can design the catalysts and then transmit them to realistic conditions, but we didn’t know how the catalyst materials behave as catalysis is occurring,” Kumar said. “That’s a critical piece of information that has not been taken into consideration when designing new catalysts. “What we have shown with this paper is that we now have the tools to investigate how catalysts dynamically change just before catalysis, during catalysis, and after catalysis,” he continued. “And these dynamic changes can be correlated to the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.” Improving industrial chemical processes isn’t the only reason for developing new catalysts. Nearly one-third of the world’s energy is devoted to the chemical industry, Kumar said, so finding ways to make those processes more efficient — either by speeding them up or by enabling them to take place at lower temperatures — could yield a significant environmental impact. “There is a huge carbon footprint left by many of these chemical processes, some of which are more than 100 years old,” Kumar said. “If we can reduce the energy budget for those processes … it could have a tremendous impact on energy usage, and dramatically change that carbon footprint. And now we have the tools to do that.”

The 2016 U.S. presidential election raised significant concerns among academics, political observers, policymakers, and others about the role social media played in the spread of misinformation during the campaign and the concurrent rise in polarization. So when Andrew Guess of Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs was given the chance to use de-identified primary data from two of the world’s most influential platforms to study their effects on the 2020 election, he leapt at it. “I’ve long believed that conducting on-platform experiments to study the impact of feature changes and other interventions on real-user behavior is the holy grail for research on social media and politics,” said Guess, an assistant professor of politics and public affairs at SPIA whose research bridges political communication, public opinion and political behavior. “To that end, for several years I’ve been involved with efforts to facilitate data-sharing between researchers and platforms, so when this unique opportunity arose, I was fortunate to be asked to join the project team as it was coming together.” Guess and his 16 academic collaborators joined with researchers from Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to explore how changes in those platforms’ delivery of content affected users. The first of the team’s work was published this week — three papers in Science and one in Nature. The academic team proposed and selected specific research questions and study designs with Meta’s explicit agreement that the company could reject them only for legal, privacy or infeasibility reasons. Meta could not restrict or censor findings, and the academic lead authors had final say over writing and research decisions. “Due in large part to the fact that the relevant data about users’ experiences and behaviors are locked up inside the platforms themselves, comprehensive evidence of these impacts has been scarce,” Guess said. In “How Do Social Media Feed Algorithms Affect Attitudes and Behavior in an Election Campaign?,” Guess and his coauthors investigated the effects of Facebook and Instagram feed algorithms for 23,000 consenting Facebook users and 21,000 consenting Instagram users from October through December 2020. The team assigned a sample of users to reverse chronologically ordered feeds — in which the newest content appears at the top of the feed — while the control group’s feeds were governed by the platforms’ default algorithms. They found that moving users out of the algorithmic feeds “substantially decreased the time they spent on the platforms and their activities.” The move also affected the kind of content users saw, with “political and untrustworthy content” increasing on both platforms, “uncivil and hateful content” decreasing on Facebook, and “content from moderate friends and ideologically mixed audiences” rising on Facebook. Despite these changes, the users who were fed chronologically based content did not report significant changes in their levels of issue polarization, affective polarization, political knowledge or other key attitudes over the course of the study. Guess’ other Science paper, “Reshares on Social Media Amplify Political News But Do Not Detectably Affect Beliefs or Opinions,” studied the effects of exposure to reshared content during the 2020 election. A random subset of 23,000 Facebook users were assigned feeds that contained no reshared content over the study’s three months. Removing reshares, the researchers report, greatly reduced “the amount of political news, including content from untrustworthy sources to which users were exposed; decrease[d] overall clicks and reactions; and reduced partisan news clicks.” As in the first Science study, the team found no changes in political polarization or individual-level political attitudes in the subset who saw no reshared content. Those users did, however, display marked reductions in accurate news knowledge. “This implies that reshares make people more knowledgeable,” said Guess, “which may seem counterintuitive since potentially viral reshared content is thought to promote misinformation — and, in fact, we present evidence that it does to some extent. But more reshared content is actually from trustworthy than untrustworthy sources, so on net people are more informed.” The three papers published today in Science and the one in Nature are the first of at least 10 more that are in the pipeline. In addition, the team is giving access to de-identified data from the studies to other academic researchers who want to explore their own research questions.

Partisan media outlets are often blamed for growing polarization, but new research points to another consequence of consuming partisan news: an erosion of trust in the media. Internet users were asked to change their default browser homepages to either the Huffington Post, a left-leaning news site, or Fox News, a more conservative outlet, during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. As participants went about their daily activities, they allowed the researchers to survey them multiple times as well as to collect data on millions of web visits and their posts on Twitter. After eight weeks, the participants’ trust in the media appeared to decrease, and this effect remained detectable nearly a year later for visitors to both partisan news sites. Increased exposure to partisan news led to an immediate — though short-lived — boost in the number of visits to both sites, as well as improved knowledge of recent events. However, these effects did not appear to translate to changes in political attitudes, opinions or behaviors. “Past studies have shown links between exposure to partisan news and polarization, but the driver behind this has been up for debate,” said study co-author Andy Guess, assistant professor of politics and public affairs at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. “Our work adds a piece to this puzzle, showing that it’s difficult for people to be persuaded by competing media outlets during an election campaign. That said, longer time spent on these sites does lead to a growing distrust in the news.” Guess conducted the study with Pablo Barberá of the University of Southern California; Simon Munzert of the Hertie School; and JungHwan Yang of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The researchers partnered with the online polling firm YouGov, an international research data and analytics group. They initially recruited 1,551 respondents from YouGov’s “Pulse” panel, which included users who had previously installed passive metering software on their desktop and mobile devices. This software collects in-depth data about online behaviors. Participants agreed to join a “Politics and Media” study with multiple survey waves and could leave at any time. In the first waves of the study, the researchers asked participants about the news they consume, their attitudes on domestic and foreign policy issues, whether they voted and their voting preferences, as well as if they approved of President Donald Trump. They also were asked to predict what might happen in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. In the third survey wave, the researchers implemented what they call a “nudge-like” approach where a third of the group was asked to change their browser homepage to a left-leaning news outlet (Huffington Post) and another third was asked to change it to a right-leaning news outlet (Fox News). The other third weren’t asked to change anything, becoming the “control” group. The researchers chose Fox News and Huffington Post for their significance in the current political environment, as well as on the basis of empirical web tracking data of who consumes news on their sites. They found that those in the Huffington Post homepage group visited approximately one additional page on the website per day, which amounted to nearly 50 seconds of additional browsing time.. The Fox News group visited nearly four more pages per day, or an additional two minutes. Before the study, participants had only spent about 34 minutes per week on average on any news site. “We asked our study participants to change a default setting on their devices — the browser homepage. The result was a classic nudge-like effect, demonstrating the importance of basic digital ‘opt-ins’ to structure people’s information consumption. Just as we were able to boost the partisan composition of people’s news diets, social platforms, public media, and other intermediaries can draw on our findings to promote authoritative, nonpartisan sources of information. This could be part of the solution as society looks for ways to reverse our downward spiral of distrust,” Guess said. This research was funded by a grant from the Volkswagen Foundation Computational Social Science Initiative. The experiment was additionally supported by the Princeton University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Center for International Studies at the University of Southern California.

Much like an overexploited ecosystem, the increasingly polarized political landscape in the United States — and much of the world — is experiencing a catastrophic loss of diversity that threatens the resilience not only of democracy, but also of society, according to a series of new studies that examine political polarization as a collection of complex ever-evolving systems. Fifteen interdisciplinary teams of political scientists and complex systems theorists in the natural sciences and engineering explored how polarization is produced and influenced over time by the actions and interactions of individual voters, people in power, and various social networks. Ultimately, as social interactions and individual decisions isolate people into only a few intractable camps, the political system becomes incapable of addressing the range of issues — or formulating the variety of solutions — necessary for government to function and provide the services critical for society. The studies were published Dec. 6 in a special issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that stemmed from a collaboration between Princeton University and Arizona State University (ASU) and includes several papers led by Princeton researchers. “The complex systems perspective demonstrates that the loss of diversity associated with polarization undermines cooperation and the ability of societies to provide the public goods that make for a healthy society,” according to an introduction by issue editors Simon Levin, Princeton’s James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Helen Milner, the B.C. Forbes Professor of Public Affairs and professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, and Charles Perrings, professor of environmental economics at ASU. “Polarization is a dynamic process and that is what complexity theory can best help us understand,” they wrote. “As environmental and complexity scientists have shown in other contexts, diversity maintenance is critical for many systems to thrive, and often to survive at all.” “The polarization currently being experienced both within and among nations undercuts efforts to deal with critical issues facing societies, none more so than those related to the environment — from climate change and extreme weather, to the emergence of pandemic viruses such as COVID-19,” said Levin, who is director of the Center for BioComplexity based in Princeton’s High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI) and associated faculty in HMEI. Complex adaptive systems — which are widespread in fields from physics and financial systems to natural systems driven by evolution and socioeconomic-political systems — allow scientists to understand the multiscale interactions that result in specific structures and outcomes, Levin said. At that point, efforts to mitigate negative results can be implemented more effectively. “These systems are composed of individual agents, in which there is an interplay, and perhaps a coevolution, between the attitudes and actions of individual agents and the emergent properties of the systems to which they belong,” he said. “Similar challenges exist across these applications, involving the need for a statistical mechanics to scale from individuals to collectives, to the emergence of patterns and processes such as social norms.” Despite the rise of partisanship, populism and polarization, these phenomena have not been thoroughly studied as dynamic systems consisting of multiple interacting components and large-scale features, Milner said. “James Madison had hoped that the system devised in the Constitution would avoid the sorts of polarization that political parties can produce and that can undermine the workings of government,” Milner said. “Sadly, we are seeing polarization today and a subsequent loss of diversity in the range of positions in society within the United States and globally,” she said. “The papers in this issue demonstrate from a systems perspective the forces that lead to polarization — and some of the consequences of it — with the hope that understanding them will lead to better governance.” The studies from Princeton researchers are summarized below. The papers explored issues from how people unwittingly isolate themselves into partisan networks through social media and how to ensure successful electoral reforms using models, to how public opinion fuels extremism among political elites, as well as the potential benefits of polarization under the right circumstances.

People unwittingly polarize themselves by ditching followers considered untrustworthy A computational model tested with Twitter data showed that social media users may inadvertently sort themselves into polarized networks by “unfollowing” users they consider untrustworthy news sources. Princeton researchers Andy Guess, assistant professor of politics and public affairs, Corina Tarnita, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and first author Christopher Tokita, who received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 2021, found that when people are less reactive to news, their online environment remains politically mixed. When users constantly react to and share articles from their preferred news sources, however, they are more likely to develop politically isolated networks, or what the researchers call “epistemic bubbles.” Once users are in these bubbles, they miss out on more news articles, including those from their preferred media outlets. “It’s not hard to find evidence of polarized discourse on social media, but we know less about the mechanisms of how social media can drive people apart,” Guess said. “Our contribution is to show that polarization of online social networks emerges naturally as people curate their feeds. Counterintuitively, this can occur even without knowing other users’ partisan identities.” While it is well-documented that Americans are not as polarized as the people they elect, a study led by Naomi Ehrich Leonard, Princeton’s Edwin S. Wilsey Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Keena Lipsitz, associate professor of political science at Queens College, CUNY, with Princeton doctoral student Anastasia Bizyaeva shows that Americans are still partly to blame for the extremism of their elected officials. The researchers found that over time, conservative swings in public opinion — which are typically slightly larger and more prolonged than liberal swings — exacerbate the self-reinforcement processes for Republican lawmakers, wherein legislators respond to favorable public opinion by further bolstering their own positions. They identified a tipping point beyond which the process of polarization speeds up as the forces driving it are compounded and the forces mitigating polarization are overwhelmed. They report that Republicans may have passed this critical threshold while Democrats are quickly approaching it. “By combining our expertise on political processes together with our expertise on feedback and nonlinearity in complex time-varying processes, we were able to make new discoveries about the mechanisms that can explain, and potentially mitigate, political polarization,” Leonard said. “Until now, the ways in which public opinion changes over time had not been implicated in the political polarization of lawmakers,” she said. “Yet, by accounting for nonlinearity in how lawmakers respond to public opinion, we show that these differences matter significantly and small differences in public opinion swings can in fact lead to large changes in polarization. I am hopeful that the analytical tools we developed for this study will prove useful in finding ways to slow down the trend.” Intergroup conflict triggered by economic hardship can reduce social and economic interactions, which in turn further exacerbates economic decline and political polarization, according to a paper coauthored by Nolan McCarty, Princeton’s Susan Dod Brown Professor of Politics and Public Affairs, and Joshua Plotkin, a professor of natural sciences at the University of Pennsylvania who received his Ph.D. from Princeton, with first author Alexander J. Stewart, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. The findings suggest that progressive taxation designed to ensure an adequate social safety net could help prevent the economic anxieties that fuel ethnic and racial conflict. “During the past 20 years, the United States and many other countries have experienced profound economic, social and political upheaval — including economic crises, escalating inequality, the exacerbation of racial and ethnic conflicts, and deepening political polarization,” McCarty said. “Our paper is an attempt to understand the complex dynamics that link these developments and explore ways to break the negative cycle.”

Partisan interpersonal interactions can weaken Madison’s cure for factions: A study led by Corina Tarnita, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and doctoral student Mari Kawakatsu in Princeton’s Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics examined how partisan interpersonal interactions can weaken processes that the framers of the US Constitution viewed as safeguards against factions and polarization. Kawakatsu and Tarnita co-authored the study with Simon Levin, Princeton’s James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Yphtach Lelkes, associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers were inspired by James Madison’s essay, “Federalist No. 10,” in which he argued that a republic mitigates the dangers of factions by fostering a diversity of political interests. But Americans today care about many more political issues than they did 75 years ago, yet polarization is worse. The authors developed a theoretical model of cultural evolution to investigate the possible role that interactions among partisan opinionated citizens play in this puzzle. Their analysis confirmed Madison’s intuition that societal cohesion increases when individuals care about a greater diversity of issues. But there is a twist — under extreme partisanship, individuals’ openness to learning from peers with a different political ideology is diminished. This leads to greater tribalism that drastically diminishes interest diversity, which leads to high within-ideology camaraderie and heightened polarization. But the researchers also found a silver lining: the harmful effects of extreme partisanship are only substantial when individuals are primarily relying on social peers to shape their opinions and strategies and are limited in their independent exploration. “Our model suggests that actively pursuing learning from beyond one’s social network is crucial to maintaining a cohesive society,” Tarnita said. “Although both opinion formation and cooperation are well-explored topics, we understand relatively little about the coupled dynamics of cooperation and polarization,” Kawakatsu said. “The unexpected interactions we found between partisanship, cooperation and independent exploration highlight the need to study polarization in a coupled, multi-level context.” The implications of democracy reforms such as ranked-choice voting and citizen redistricting may be better understood using dynamic systems theory based in engineering and biology, according to an analysis led by Sam Wang, professor of neuroscience and director of the Electoral Innovation Lab at Princeton, with political scientists Keena Lipsitz at the City University of New York, Jonathan Cervas from Carnegie Mellon University, and Bernard Grofman at UC Irvine. Wang and a multi-institutional team of political scientists report that systems-based theory typically used in the sciences can help understand the myriad of interactions that lead to current weaknesses in American democracy — particularly polarized institutions, unresponsive representatives and the ability of a faction of voters to gain power at the expense of the majority. Concepts such as nonlinearities and amplification, positive and negative feedback, and integration over time can help identify problems in representation and institutional power. Similarly, the effectiveness of any proposed reform is difficult to predict against a backdrop of complex network interactions. A mathematically rich description of how electoral mechanisms interact can maximize the impacts of reforms in the context of the politics and procedures of individual states. “Our core objective was to translate the American political system into a mathematical complex-systems framework that fosters participation by scholars of the natural sciences,” Wang said. “We want to encourage natural scientists to build models that reproduce political phenomena, create simulations to explore alternative scenarios, and design interventions that may improve the function of democracy,” he said. “These goals are analogous to those of engineers — to understand a system of many parts well enough to make repairs or improvements.”

Less knowledge, more power: Uninformed can be vital to democracy, study finds By Morgan Kelly on Dec. 15, 2011, 2 p.m. Contrary to the ideal of a completely engaged electorate, individuals who have the least interest in a specific outcome can actually be vital to achieving a democratic consensus. These individuals dilute the influence of powerful minority factions who would otherwise dominate everyone else, according to new research published in the journal Science. The researchers report that in animal groups, uninformed individuals — as in those with no prior knowledge or strong feelings on a situation’s outcome — tend to side with and embolden the numerical majority. Relating the results to human political activity, the study challenges the common notion that an outspoken minority can manipulate uncommitted voters. Princeton University-led researchers found that uninformed individuals — those with no strong opinion or prior knowledge — promote democratic consensus by diluting the power of a strongly opinionated minority that would otherwise dominate group decisions. Because uninformed individuals have no feelings on a situation’s outcome, they side with and embolden the numerical majority. The researchers saw this dynamic play out with golden shiners, a strongly schooling fish. The researchers trained a large number of groups to swim toward a blue target, while smaller groups were trained to follow their natural predilection for a yellow target (right image). When placed together, the large trained group would follow the smaller group to the yellow target. When fish with no prior training (the uninformed individuals) were introduced, however, the fish increasingly swam toward the majority-preferred blue target. The experiments involved golden shiners, a fish prone to associating the color yellow with a food reward, Couzin said. The researchers trained groups of golden shiners to swim toward a blue target, while smaller groups were trained to follow their natural predilection for a yellow target. When the two groups were placed together, the minority’s stronger desire for the yellow target dominated the group’s behavior. As fish with no prior training (the uninformed individuals) were introduced, however, the fish increasingly swam toward the majority-preferred blue target, the researchers report. The researchers constructed models of animal groups with a majority and a minority population, each with a differing preference to move in a certain direction. How strongly the respective groups felt about their preference could be increased or decreased. As the preference of the minority group became more intense, the preference of the majority became less likely to be realized until the minority won out every time. (Image by Science/AAAS) “We think of being informed as good and being uninformed as bad, but that’s a human construct. Animal groups are rarely in a fractious state and we see consensus a lot,” said Couzin, who studies the behavior and communication behind animal movement, swarming and flocking. Donald Saari, a professor of mathematics and economics at the University of California-Irvine who studies voting systems, said he sees parallels to the Princeton-led work in markets and politics. Highly informed economic forecasters and political activists frequently lose out to the masses of consumers and regular voters who base decisions on personal preferences and reasons more than on expertise, said Saari, who is familiar with the Science report but had no role in it. A forceful minority can dominate in circumstances that attract the more politically inclined, such as midterm elections and primaries. In more popular elections, however, that influence wanes as less passionate people participate. Situations in which a candidate’s personality or personal life takes precedent over policy positions in voters’ minds could be an equivalent to the breakdown in direction Couzin and his co-authors found when there is a glut of uninformed individuals, Saari said. “This study gives us a new interpretation of group decision making that really flies in the face of previous opinions. We usually assume that a highly opinionated and forceful group is going to sway everyone,” Saari said. “I think the effect the uninformed have is much more than just number-counting plurality and that they’re offering something else,” Saari said. “Why are the fish with no ‘opinion’ more effective toward taking the group toward plurality than the fish that only had some opinion? What is that additional dynamic, what are the real contributions of the uninformed? I don’t know what it is, but I do know it’s worth investigating.

Get moving! The mystery of animal group behavior By Tom Garlinghouse, Office of Communications on Sept. 30, 2019, 1:07 p.m. It’s not uncommon to see a flock of birds, startled by some perceived threat, take to the air in a highly coordinated flight. Similar behavior can be observed in schooling fishes where each fish, mimicking the movement of its neighbor, turns, darts or zigzags away from a threat with uncanny precision. In both cases, it seems as if the respective groups — the flock and the school — are acting as a single, unified entity. This phenomenon, called a “behavioral cascade,” has long confounded biologists. How decisions about which way to move and how fast are communicated to many individuals — often numbering in the hundreds or even thousands — and how these decisions are processed and coordinated so swiftly is a little understood topic. In a paper published on Sept. 23 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Matt Sosna, who received his Ph.D. in ecology and evolutional biology from Princeton and is a data scientist at Aquicore, and his colleagues investigate the central question of how group animals — like flocking birds, schooling fish and herding mammals — process information about their environment, a procedure called collective computation. To do this, the researchers studied how small schooling fish called golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) respond to perceived threats. Like flocking birds and herding ungulates, these fish are known for evading predators by exhibiting “startle cascades.” This behavior is analogous to an avalanche or a wave, said Sosna. It begins by a fast and sudden burst of swimming initiated by one or more fish responding to a perceived threat. “Think about a soccer game where everyone is doing the ‘wave,’” he said. “I stand up and then you stand up. And then the next person stands up. You can think of this as a behavioral cascade so that the behavior — standing up — is cascading through the group like a wave.” Shiners, common to ponds, lakes and sloughs in eastern North America, are a “jumpy” species that startle often — sometimes even apparently randomly — when there’s no overt threat. Sometimes two or three or more fish will startle, but that does not necessarily propagate throughout the school. However, a large cascade — one that spreads through the whole school — depends on how close the fish are together. Shiners will bunch up closely in response to a threat. This in itself does not cause a cascade but, because the fish are packed closely together, when a startle does occur, Sosna noted, it is more likely to generate a full-blown startle cascade. “It’s kind of like if you’re across a movie theater from me and you yell and startle. I might not startle, but if you’re right next to me I will,” said Joseph Bak-Coleman, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology, who also contributed to the paper. The necessity of avoiding predators and other threats is a crucial aspect of survival. It is a key element, along with mating and food acquisition, dictating an organism’s reproductive success or “fitness” — its ability to pass on its genes to succeeding generations. Decision-making among individual animals faced with risky or potentially dangerous situations — such as from a predator or some other threat — has been well studied. Scientists know quite a bit about how the brains of individual animals respond to such contingencies. They do this, for example, through a complex interplay involving sensory inputs from the environment and previous experience — all mediated by physiological states and limitations.

Birds of a feather - track seven neighbors to flock together By Anna Azvolinsky for the Office of Engineering Communications on Feb. 7, 2013, 3 p.m. Watching a flock of thousands of starlings take to the sky is a spectacular sight. As the flock changes direction, it looks like a formation of suspended iron filings guided by an invisible magnet in the sky. Princeton University researchers have revealed a key piece of math behind this magic. Working with a team of Italian physicists, Professor Naomi Leonard and colleagues found that flocking starlings strike an optimal balance between the work of responding to social cues from their neighbors and the need to conserve energy. This trade-off yields a special number: seven. When starlings coordinate with their seven nearest neighbors, they form their characteristic flocks with the least effort. The finding has implications not just for unlocking the mysteries of coordinated animal movements, but also for the field of robotics, in which engineers seek to emulate nature’s efficiency in coordinating the activity of many individuals in uncertain environments. “In a flock with 1,200 birds, it is clear that not every bird will be able to keep track of the other 1,199 birds, so an important question is ’who is keeping track of whom?’” said Leonard, Princeton’s Edwin S. Wilsey Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. The researchers published their results Jan. 31 in the journal Public Library of Science-Computational Biology. In addition to Leonard, the authors include Princeton graduate student George Young, Luca Scardovi of the University of Toronto, and Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina of the Sapienza University of Rome. Starlings, a type of songbird, are particularly known to produce elaborate flock patterns. Each bird in the flock moves independently but must sense and react to neighboring birds. “There is significant uncertainty for each bird in what it measures about its neighbors, where its neighbors are heading, and how it may respond,” Leonard said. The research is part of Leonard’s broader effort to study how flocks of birds or schools of fish synchronize their movements for a common goal such as finding food or avoiding predators. She seeks to understand how individuals contribute to the success of a mobile group, especially when the group has no individual leader — no magnet pulling around the iron filings. The Princeton team collaborated with physicists Cavagna and Giardina in Italy, who had previously identified seven as an important number in starling flocks. The Italian team had recorded videos of starling flocks that allowed detailed tracking of each bird. Setting up multiple cameras on top of a building, Cavagna and Giardina spent years filming the starlings flocking above a train station in Rome. The physicists used more than 400 shots from many videos to figure out the positions and speeds of each bird. They ultimately showed that rather than keeping track of every neighbor within a certain distance, each bird tracks and responds to a finite number of its closest neighbors — seven in the case of starling flocks. Young and Leonard then used this data to create a mathematical model that allowed them to evaluate the varying levels of coordination or consensus in the flocks depending on how many neighbors each bird tracks during flight.

Video feature: ‘Flock Logic’ collaboration unites science and dance By Nick Barberio on Jan. 31, 2011, noon The unusual sight of dancers behaving like flocking birds recently in some of the indoor common spaces on the Princeton campus was inspired by a collaboration between two Princeton faculty members that merged science and art. A video of “Flock Logic,” presents a profile of a project led by Naomi Leonard, Princeton’s Edwin S. Wilsey Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Susan Marshall, director of the Program in Dance in Princeton’s Lewis Center for the Arts, that brings together the art of dance and the study of the way animal groups move together. The effort was born in October 2009, when Leonard discussed her research in a talk titled “Flocks and Fleets: Collective Motion in Nature and Robotics” as part of the President’s Lecture Series. Leonard’s talk described efforts by her and others to understand how bird flocks and fish schools move in patterns that seem highly choreographed, and then to apply these principles in designing robotic devices that work with unprecedented efficiency. In the audience was Marshall, an internationally renowned artist who had recently joined the Princeton faculty. After the lecture, Leonard received an e-mail from Marshall, who proposed that they combine their interests and explore some of these flocking ideas with dancers. The collaboration between Leonard and Marshall -- both recipients of MacArthur Foundation “genius grants” -- fit perfectly with the spirit of the Princeton Atelier, an academic program created by Professor Emeritus Toni Morrison to support professional artists who come to campus for intensive collaborative work with students and faculty. The beauty and complexity of animals in motion such as bird flocks and fish schools inspired Leonard and Marshall to create a class with dancers and students that culminated in two cross-disciplinary, cross-species performances. The performances, developed by students in the Atelier course, were held Dec. 5 and 6 in the Icahn Laboratory atrium and the Rockefeller College common room, respectively. The basic rules of flocking -- the way biologists understand how animals stay together in a group and avoid colliding -- depend on cohesion and repulsion, according to Leonard. By introducing dance and performance into Leonard’s scientific theories about flocking, Marshall aimed to explore how the rules of flocking might be put to artistic use and also possibly discover something about the ways in which people, as opposed to fish, sense and respond to others in a group. Leonard’s work closely examines the mathematical rules associated with sensing and dynamic response that govern the movements of individuals in a group. “The understanding about this collective motion that you see in animal groups emerges not from a prescribed choreography and not from even a designated leader in the group, but rather from these simple rules of response that each individual in the group obeys,” she said. When the Atelier class was just the spark of an idea, sophomore Willa Chen, a dancer and computer programmer, worked with the two professors to create an online simulation program that would later help shape the class. With this simulator, Chen could program rules of flocking that would inspire choreographic movement, such as maintaining distance between dancers and avoiding obstacles. According to Marshall, performances based on principles such as those found in animal flocking are not unusual.  “In dance, we have something called structured improvisation, which is a compositional approach in which people agree on rules,” she said. “They’re often very complicated dance rules and instructions … and yet the specific outcome of the dance is unknown.” The “Flock Logic” performances, which included students, professional dancers and volunteers from across campus who were given training beforehand, appeared choreographed though they were simply following the rules of flocking as found in nature. The Atelier course and the dance rehearsals and performance attracted a diverse group of people who were interested in dance, science or were simply curious and willing subjects. Ultimately, the motivating factor for the professors was the desire to create an event that would engage a cross-section of the community in the collaborative exercise of flocking, one in which participants could experience movement as both science and art.

Michelle Obama brings service commitment to White House; alumni play key roles on transition team By Emily Aronson on Nov. 7, 2008, 3:40 p.m. It was in the halls of Princeton’s Third World Center that class of 1985 graduate Michelle Obama cultivated her commitment to service. In January, she will be the first Princeton alumna to serve as first lady of the United States. And as the new administration prepares to take office, three Princeton alumni have key roles on President-elect Barack Obama’s transition team. Christopher Lu of the class of 1988 will serve as executive director of the presidential transition team, known as the Obama-Biden Transition Project. Class of 1982 graduate Lisa Brown has been named the transition team’s co-director of agency review, and Michael Froman, a 1985 classmate of Michelle Obama’s, has been appointed to the project’s advisory board. Obama, formerly Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, majored in sociology at Princeton and was actively involved with African American and service organizations on campus. She will be the first African American first lady. Her commitment to serving her community was nurtured at Princeton as she served on the Third World Center’s governing board and was coordinator of its after-school program. The center, now known as the Fields Center, was established in 1971 to provide a social, cultural and political environment that was responsive to issues of ethnic and racial diversity. “The grace, intelligence and compassion we see in Michelle Obama today were evident when she was a student at Princeton,” said class of 1984 graduate Hilary Beard, a friend of Obama’s while at Princeton. “She was always kind toward and attentive to other people, especially children, for whom she exhibited tremendous concern. In particular, this was reflected in her community service tutoring children in the town of Princeton.” Czerny Brasuell, director of the Third World Center from 1981 to 1984, said Obama was an empathetic and honest student who identified with the needs of others -- traits she is sure to bring to the role of first lady. “Her strengths as a tremendously humane and intelligent individual would be used in service of whatever role she saw fit to take on,” Brasuell said. Obama’s interest in public service continued after graduating from Princeton and Harvard Law School in 1988. After working at the law firm Sidley Austin in her hometown of Chicago, she served as assistant commissioner of planning and development for the city of Chicago and then as the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares young people for public service. She also worked for the University of Chicago, where she developed the university’s first community service program as associate dean of student services, and later became vice president of community and external affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center. Obama’s brother, Craig Robinson, is a member of Princeton’s class of 1983. Robinson played on the Princeton men’s basketball team, earning two Ivy League Player of the Year titles, and is now the head men’s basketball coach at Oregon State University. Michelle and President-elect Barack Obama were married in 1992 and have two daughters, Malia and Sasha.

Chang appointed University spokesperson and director of media relations By the Office of Communications on Sept. 6, 2018, 10:19 a.m. Ben Chang, an experienced communications executive and policy practitioner in the federal government and the private sector, has been named University spokesperson and director of media relations at Princeton. Chang has been managing director in the U.S. Public Affairs and Crisis practice at Burson-Marsteller in Washington, D.C., since 2016. He will assume his new duties Sept. 24. His appointment was announced Thursday, Sept. 6, by Brent Colburn, Princeton’s vice president of communications and public affairs. “Ben Chang’s career in communications speaks for itself — he is one of the best in the business, and we are lucky to have him joining our team,” said Colburn. “At Princeton we believe deeply in putting service at the center of our work, and Ben’s proven commitment to serving others, combined with his creativity, media savvy and professionalism, make him the ideal person to serve as Princeton’s spokesperson.” Across three presidential administrations, Chang advised White House and cabinet officials and supported the implementation of U.S. foreign policy as a career foreign service officer. At Princeton, he will oversee the University’s media affairs team and serve as a counselor to Colburn and President Christopher L. Eisgruber in shaping and executing University media and messaging strategy. “I could not be more excited to join the Princeton University community and its public affairs and communications team,” Chang said. “The mission of the University — ‘in the nation’s service and the service of humanity’ — and President Eisgruber’s vision of Princeton and other universities as forces for good in this world resonate deeply with my background in public service. “And as a first-generation American who believes our country is stronger because of its diversity, I am personally inspired by Princeton’s commitment to access, inclusion and representation across higher education,” Chang said. Before joining Burson-Marsteller, Chang served as associate administrator for communications at the Small Business Administration and vice president/events editor at The Los Angeles Times. From 2008 to 2011, Chang served in the White House as director for press and communications and as deputy spokesman for the National Security Council under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. A native of Washington, D.C., Chang graduated from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. He is on the board of directors of the Council for a Livable World and serves on the D.C. Leadership Council for the U.S. Soccer Foundation and the Rising Leaders Council for the Meridian International Center.

Princeton alumna Maria Ressa wins Nobel Peace Prize By Denise Valenti, Office of Communications on Oct. 8, 2021, 1:05 p.m. The 2021 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded today to Princeton graduate Maria Ressa for her efforts to “safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace.” She received half of the award, while the other half was awarded to Dmitry Muratov, founder and editor-in-chief of the Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta. Ressa is CEO and executive editor of the Philippines-based online news organization Rappler.com. She graduated from Princeton in 1986 with a bachelor of arts in English and a certificate in theater and dance. Ressa’s Nobel win caps an extraordinary week for Princeton. On Tuesday, Oct. 5, Princeton University senior meteorologist Syukuro “Suki” Manabe was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in physics. On Wednesday, Oct. 6, David MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry, was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Ressa has been a journalist in Asia for more than 30 years. In 2012, she co-founded Rappler.com, now one of the leading online news organizations in the Philippines. Previously, Ressa was CNN’s bureau chief in Manila and Jakarta. She taught in Princeton’s Program in Journalism in 2000-01 when she worked for CNN. Rappler’s reporting on the authoritarian administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has spurred repeated intimidation tactics by the Philippine government to discredit Ressa and the media outlet. In 2020, she was convicted in the Philippines along with a former Rappler reporter for “cyber libel.” She is currently appealing that conviction. “Maria Ressa uses freedom of expression to expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country, the Philippines,” the Nobel Committee noted in announcing the award today. “As a journalist and the Rappler’s CEO, Ressa has shown herself to be a fearless defender of freedom of expression. Rappler has focused critical attention on the Duterte regime’s controversial, murderous anti-drug campaign. The number of deaths is so high that the campaign resembles a war waged against the country’s own population. Ms. Ressa and Rappler have also documented how social media is being used to spread fake news, harass opponents and manipulate public discourse.” Rappler recorded an interview with Ressa today, in which she said the site has been “fighting for facts.” “When we live in a world where facts are debatable, when the world’s largest distributor of news prioritizes the spread of lies laced with anger and hate, and spreads it faster and further than facts, then journalism becomes activism,” she said. “And that’s the transformation that we’ve gone through in Rappler, that we were on quicksand trying to figure out how to do what we do. How can journalists continue the mission of journalism?” “This is a tremendous day for Maria, journalism and democracy around the globe,” said Joe Stephens, founding director of Princeton’s Program in Journalism, Ferris Professor of Journalism and lecturer in the Humanities Council. “Maria is the bravest human I know. She risked her life repeatedly to bring to light corruption and injustice, with huge impact. Just as important, she continues to inspire and embolden other courageous journalists everywhere. At the Program in Journalism, we’re honored to call her one of our own. She’s the very embodiment of the University’s informal motto: ‘Princeton in the nation’s service and the service of humanity.’” Stephens continued: “Maria was an inspiration when she visited us on campus in 2019 — smiling and cheery at a time when her very life and liberty hung in the balance. You would never guess that she had just been arrested twice and faced arrest again on her impending return to the Philippines. ‘Heroic’ doesn’t even begin to describe her.” Marissa Michaels, a member of the Class of 2022, attended the talk Ressa gave at Princeton in 2019, as well as a dinner with Ressa for journalism students. She said Ressa has been an inspiration to her as a journalist and as a global citizen. “The only defense journalists have is to shine the light,” she said on the podcast. “And part of what’s keeping us safe is because of the coverage that international news groups are giving what’s happening in the Philippines, both the drug war, the information war and the attacks against Rappler.”

Princeton’s David MacMillan receives Nobel Prize in chemistry By The Office of Communications on Oct. 6, 2021, 6:15 a.m. Princeton University professor David W.C. MacMillan has been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry “for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis.” “David MacMillan is a brilliant chemist whose transformative insights and accomplishments have enhanced the power of organic chemistry to benefit human health and address other practical problems,” said University President Christopher L. Eisgruber. “He is also a faculty leader who during his time at Princeton has worked with colleagues to build this University’s Department of Chemistry into one of the world’s best. All of us at Princeton are thrilled to celebrate this well-deserved honor.” “Building molecules is a difficult art. Benjamin List and David MacMillan are awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry 2021 for their development of a precise new tool for molecular construction: organocatalysis. This has had a great impact on pharmaceutical research, and has made chemistry greener,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted in announcing the award today. The prize amount is 10 million Swedish kroner, or about $1.14 million, split between the two laureates. MacMillan is an innovator, pursuing radically new concepts in catalysis. Today the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences highlighted his work in organocatalysis, finding revolutionary ways to design and build small organic molecules in order to drive chemical reactions. He is also a leader in the field of photoredox catalysis, which uses light — ordinary, visible light — to break and rejoin atomic bonds, one electron at a time. MacMillan joins a number of other Princeton faculty and alumni who have been awarded Nobel Prizes, including Syukuro Manabe, who won the Nobel in physics yesterday. “What we care about is trying to invent chemistry that has an impact on society and can do some good, and I am thrilled to have a part in that,” MacMillan said. “Organocatalysis was a pretty simple idea that really sparked a lot of different research, and the part we’re just so proud of is that you don’t have to have huge amounts of equipment and huge amounts of money to do fine things in chemistry.” He came to Princeton in 2006 and was appointed as director of the University’s Merck Center for Catalysis. He has been the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry since 2011 and served as chair of the chemistry department from 2010 to 2015, when he passed leadership off to Tom Muir, a fellow Scotsman. Michele Sarazen, assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering, said that beyond MacMillan’s own research, his role in spearheading the creation of the Princeton Catalysis Initiative has advanced the research of many people and accelerated the positive impacts of that research. Through the initiative, MacMillan helps “create bridges and connect people who might not normally have worked together to do really cool and important science and engineering,” Sarazen said. “That’s not just people on campus. It’s also bridging academic labs with industrial partners.” MacMillan is the recipient of numerous awards including: the 2019 Centenary Prize from the Royal Society of Chemistry; the 2018 Gabor A. Somorjal Award for Creative Research in Catalysis from the American Chemical Society (ACS); the 2017 Ryoji Noyori Prize; the Harrison Howe Award and the Ernst Schering Prize, both in 2015; the 2011 Mitsui Chemicals Catalysis Award; the 2007 ISHC Katritzky Junior Award from the International Society for Heterocyclic Chemistry, the ACS’ Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award and the Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry’s Mukaiyama Award, both in 2006; and the 2004 Corday-Morgan medal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, among others. He is a fellow of the Royal Society, a corresponding fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. “The work Dave got the Nobel Prize for was underway at that time Princeton was recruiting him, so it was already spectacular stuff,” said Martin Semmelhack, professor of chemistry, who was largely responsible for bringing MacMillan to Princeton. “We also recognized that his work was done in a very thoughtful, analytic, creative way — and that’s what leads you to bigger and better things. It was easy to want to bring him here. It’s been fun to watch him evolve.”

MacMillan illuminates the micro-environment, creating a new path to cancer drugs Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInEmailPrint By Wendy Plump, Department of Chemistry on March 5, 2020, 1:59 p.m. The Department of Chemistry’s MacMillan Group developed a new technology called µMap that identifies proteins’ nearest neighbors on cell surfaces. When corporate partners in the Princeton Catalysis Initiative sat down two years ago with David MacMillan, they presented him with a biological challenge at the heart of potential cancer medicines and other therapeutics: which proteins on a cell’s surface touch each other? What they wanted was analogous to a searchlight blazing into a dark cave — something to shine a metaphorical light on a protein and its closest neighbors on the cell membrane. Large, complex molecules, proteins are the stuff of life, the very fulcrum on which everything about us turns — the way we think, the way we grow, the diseases we get. Proteins are able to determine this by sending messages to their neighbors. But while scientists could previously tell who was inside the cave, they could not tell who was standing next to whom, and thus were lacking important knowledge about these essential protein-to-protein communications. The breakthrough technology, named µMap by the team of Princeton researchers and Merck scientists, uses a photocatalyst — a molecule that, when activated by light, spurs a chemical reaction — to identify spatial relationships on cell surfaces. The catalyst generates a marker that tags proteins and their molecular neighbors, which in turn enables the precise mapping of their micro-environment. The technology could impact proteomics, genomics and neuroscience, to name a few of the more obvious fields. But the applications for fundamental biology are so wide-ranging that MacMillan, who is Princeton’s James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry, is hungry to get the technology “into everyone’s hands” to see what scientists in other fields can come up with. “For the technologies we have right now, the problem is not whether you can tag things,” he said. “The problem is that you can tag thousands of things and so you can’t tell what’s way over there and what’s right next door. That turns out to be really, really important because molecules or proteins or enzymes that signal each other are usually right next door to each other. Well, the state-of-the-art doesn’t tell you what’s close.” So they came up with a radical new approach. “We did some critical experiments and immediately we could show that we were labeling things within a really short distance,” MacMillan said. “We now know exactly what’s in the neighborhood. And that’s never been done before. For biology, it’s going to be like turning on the light switch and suddenly seeing everything.” Merck Exploratory Science Center (MESC) scientists Rob Oslund and Olugbeminiyi Fadeyi, paper co-authors who are based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said the technology could inspire vast new developments in biology. “Given the important role of understanding protein interactions within cellular micro-environments,” Oslund said, “this technology has the potential to be a game-changing tool for both academic and industry life science labs all over the world.” MacMillan’s group chose two categories of human cells to investigate. One was a class of proteins that had known interactions, selected as a kind of control group to prove that their interactions could be captured by µMap. The second group was “more interesting,” said Geri. It centered on proteins called PD-L1 and PD-1, which are associated with the body’s immune system and its response to cancer cells. Normally, sick cells like cancer cells would present as molecular interlopers that need to be cleared by the immune system. But cancer cells are deceptive, said MacMillan. “As chemists, we don’t know any good questions in biology — zero,” he said. “So, you’re taking these people who know everything about biology, and they have this problem that they’re trying to solve. And it’s ultimately a great problem for a chemistry group. At the same time, it’s not a problem that a chemistry group would ever think about because they don’t know biology. You have these two different areas and you put them together and you start to realize there all these great things you can do.

Carter, MacMillan receive American Chemical Society awards By Liz Fuller-Wright, Office of Communications on March 2, 2018, 11:54 a.m. Princeton faculty members Emily Carter and David MacMillan have received two of the 56 national awards administered by the American Chemical Society (ACS) for 2018. Carter, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, won the ACS Award in Theoretical Chemistry, sponsored by the ACS Division of Physical Chemistry. She was recognized for her “pioneering development of orbital-free density functional, embedded correlation wave function, and efficient multireference wave function theories, applied to diverse sustainable energy phenomena and materials design.” Carter, who is also the Gerhard R. Andlinger Professor in Energy and the Environment and professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and applied and computational mathematics, told ACS that in the next decade, she hopes to “help efficient generation of renewable fuels needed for heavy-duty transportation from photo- or electrocatalysis become a reality. Second, to use my position as an administrative leader to improve the climate in physical sciences and engineering such that an increasing number of talented people of all backgrounds choose to make our disciplines their life’s work.” “Professor Carter is one of the world’s leading developers of new theoretical methods for chemistry and materials,” said Mark Gordon, the Frances M. Craig Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Iowa State University. “The models she has developed have enabled the accurate theoretical study of a broad array of important grand-challenge problems, such as the discovery and design of molecules and materials for sustainable energy. Her insightful analyses of phenomena that range from surface science to photovoltaics and photocatalysis to metal-oxide semiconductors are legendary.” MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry, won the Gabor A. Somorjai Award for Creative Research in Catalysis, sponsored by the Gabor A. & Judith K. Somorjai Endowment Fund. ACS honored MacMillan for “his pioneering work in the development of organocatalysis, including fundamentally new methods based on radical intermediates, singly occupied molecular orbital catalysis and photoredox catalysis.” MacMillan told ACS that he finds inspiration in “an unusual result, a key insight, or a new understanding of a chemical concept that you have found in the lab. It’s like finding a hidden trap door in the back of an attic, and when you look down inside, it’s full of gold — or even wine. It’s a great feeling when it happens, and I only wish it would happen more often.” Stephen Buchwald, the Camille Dreyfus Professor of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: “Organocatalysis has become the single most published-on field of catalysis in the world. Moreover, primarily due to MacMillan’s contributions, practical applications on a large scale have begun to emerge. Further, a second field that he invented, photoredox catalysis, has the promise to be even more important than organocatalysis. MacMillan’s work has been carried out with an exceptional level of scholarship, focusing on what is important and conceptually innovative.” Carter and MacMillan will be honored with the other award recipients on Tuesday, March 20, at the 255th ACS National Meeting in New Orleans.

University committee seeking input on naming renovated spaces in Prospect House By Emily Aronson, Office of Communications on Jan. 30, 2023, 3:02 p.m. An architectural rendering of the exterior of Prospect House. Image by Verona Carpenter Architects The University’s committee on naming is seeking suggestions for naming meeting rooms and event spaces in Prospect House as part of plans to renovate the historic campus building. The Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) Committee on Naming is seeking input regarding the naming of a dozen spaces in Prospect House, including: meeting rooms on the second floor; dining, library and meeting rooms on the first floor; the terrace; and the lower-level dining area known as the tap room. Advice and suggestions may be submitted through the committee’s website. Prospect House — which serves as a dining and events venue for faculty, staff and other members of the University community  — will be closed for renovations from approximately May 2023 to August 2024. The project will include renovations to the existing spaces and mechanical systems to upgrade accessibility and functionality, providing contemporary spaces that connect with the building’s historic architecture. “Building on the excellent work to update and diversify the artwork throughout the building, the renovation project presents an important opportunity to advance ongoing efforts to diversify our institutional narratives,” President Christopher L. Eisgruber wrote in referring the spaces to the naming committee. The renovation also “provide[s] an unprecedented opportunity for the committee to consider how a suite of honorific names for spaces in close proximity together might collectively help to recount multiple dimensions of our history in a single location.” Prospect House was erected in 1849 and has been part of the University campus since 1878, serving various functions. It has been a private University dining and event facility since 2009. Prospect Gardens, located behind the house, is expected to remain open during the building renovation. The CPUC Committee on Naming was established in the fall of 2016 to provide advice to the Board of Trustees “for naming buildings or other spaces not already named for historical figures or donors to recognize individuals who would bring a more diverse presence to the campus.” Since 2016, the University has named the following spaces on campus with input from the committee on naming. 1.	The former Marx Hall was named Laura Wooten Hall in honor of Laura Wooten, who was recognized as the longest-serving election poll worker in the United States. 2.	The Lockhart Hall archway was named for Kentaro Ikeda, Class of 1944, the University’s sole Japanese student during World War II. 3.	The former West College was named Morrison Hall in honor of Nobel laureate and former Princeton faculty member Toni Morrison. 4.	The auditorium in Robertson Hall was named Arthur Lewis Auditorium in honor of Nobel laureate and former Princeton faculty member Sir Arthur Lewis. 5.	The publicly accessible garden between Firestone Library and Nassau Street was named for Betsey Stockton, a formerly enslaved woman, educator and leader in Princeton’s African American community in the 19th century. 6.	The easternmost arch in East Pyne Hall was named for James Collins Johnson, a formerly enslaved man who worked on campus for more than 60 years before his death in 1902. 7.	The roadway that enters the campus from Nassau Street between Firestone Library and the buildings of the Andlinger Center for the Humanities was named for pioneering African American alumnus and longtime Princeton resident Robert J. Rivers Jr.

Trustees name garden for Betsey Stockton, arch for Jimmy Johnson By Office of Communications on April 17, 2018, 10 a.m. The Princeton University trustees have accepted recommendations to name a publicly accessible garden between Firestone Library and Nassau Street for Betsey Stockton and to name the easternmost arch in East Pyne Hall for James Collins “Jimmy” Johnson. Stockton was a slave in the Maclean House home of Princeton President Ashbel Green who, upon gaining her freedom, became a missionary and then served the Princeton community as a founder of the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church and as a teacher and founder of the first school in Princeton for children of color. She is commemorated in a stained-glass window in the church that was presented by her former students. Johnson was a fugitive slave from Maryland who worked on campus for more than 60 years, first as a janitor and then for many years as a vendor of fruits, candies and other snacks that he sold from a wheelbarrow. When he died in 1902, alumni and students purchased a headstone for him in Princeton cemetery, and inscribed an epitaph that described him as “the students friend.” The recommendations were made by the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) Committee on Naming, a committee of faculty, students, staff and alumni that is chaired by history professor Angela Creager. In seeking to “recognize individuals who would bring a more diverse presence to the campus,” the trustees asked the CPUC in September 2017 to establish such a committee to advise the trustees about honorific naming for spaces on campus that are referred to the committee by the trustees. Last year the Naming Committee recommended naming Morrison Hall and Arthur Lewis Auditorium. A reception to celebrate the dedication of Lewis Auditorium, named for Nobel laureate and Princeton professor Sir Arthur Lewis (1915-1991), will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 18, in Robertson Hall. The University dedicated Morrison Hall, in honor of Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Humanities, Emeritus, during a ceremony last November. Stockton’s early years on the Princeton campus and her extraordinary impact on the Princeton community and beyond were recognized in the findings that were made public last fall by the Princeton and Slavery Project, a sweeping endeavor by Princeton scholars and students to explore the ties of early University trustees, presidents, faculty and students to the institution of slavery. Betsey Stockton was born into slavery around 1798 in Princeton and given by her owner, Robert Stockton, to his daughter when she married the Rev. Ashbel Green, who became president of the college in 1812. Green freed Stockton several years later, and in 1822 she traveled to Hawaii as a missionary, where she established a school for native Hawaiian children. In 1828 she relocated to Philadelphia and established a school for African American children. In 1833 she returned to Princeton, where she helped found and for almost 30 years taught in the sole Princeton public school for African American children. In 1840 she played a leading role in founding what is now Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church and led its Sunday school. An essay prepared in connection with the Princeton and Slavery Project reports that when she died in 1865, “her funeral brought together a considerable crowd of both races” and that then-President John Maclean Jr. conducted the service. In recommending the garden be named for her, the Naming Committee said that “given the many lives she nurtured over the course of her courageous life, we believe it is fitting that she be commemorated in a garden that we hope will be a place of beauty and reflection for both town and gown. We believe it is also fitting that this garden be associated with the library in whose archives so many of the discoveries of the Princeton and Slavery Project were made.”

Fung Global Fellows to focus on ‘Sustainable Futures’ By Pooja Makhijani, Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies on July 24, 2023, 3:37 p.m. Five exceptional scholars from around the world will come to Princeton University this fall to begin a year of research, writing and collaboration as the 11th cohort of Fung Global Fellows. For the 2023-24 academic year, the scholars will once again work on “sustainable futures” and explore the sustainability of current systems and practices in light of historic, contemporary and future challenges, with an eye on innovative and feasible changes that promise greater sustainability. Elke Weber, the Gerhard R. Andlinger Professor in Energy and the Environment and professor of psychology and public affairs, directs the program. “I so look forward to directing, mentoring and learning from my second cohort of fellows, the third one under the theme of ‘Sustainable Futures,’” she said. “These five fellows bring their disciplinary perspective and their geographic breadth to address timely topics, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, disaster management in the face of climate change, migration and religious identities, transnational litigation of human rights violations, and governing the gig economy in the Global South.” The two visiting research scholars for the 2023-24 academic year are: 1.	Muyiwa Adigun, senior lecturer, Faculty of Law at University of Ibadan; and 2.	Angela Ke Li, assistant professor, Department of Communications and New Media at National University of Singapore. The three postdoctoral research associates are: 1.	Ady Chinchay Tuesta, Ph.D. in sociology, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru; 2.	Laila Omar, Ph.D. in sociology, University of Toronto; and 3.	Yelena Yermakova, Ph.D. in philosophy, University of Oslo. More about the newly appointed Fung Global Fellows: Muyiwa Adigun is a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Law at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. He earned his Ph.D. in law from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he examined the principle of complementarity under the Rome Statute relative to Nigeria. As a legal researcher who specializes on the relationship between international law and domestic legal order, he will examine during his fellowship year how transnational human rights litigation can be deployed to address land grabs in Africa. Ady Chinchay Tuesta received her Ph.D. in sociology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), where she was a fellow of the Advanced Studies on Inequalities and Sustainable Development initiative by the Freie Universität Berlin and the PUCP. She also holds a master’s degree in international public policy analysis from the University of Bath in England, and a master’s in comparative law, economics and finance from the International University College of Turin in Italy. Chinchay Tuesta also holds a law degree from National University of San Marcos (Peru) and has years of experience in the public and private sectors, especially in environmental law and extractive industries. During her fellowship year, Chinchay Tuesta will examine the integration of disaster risk management and climate change policies in the Americas. Angela Ke Li is an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore. She is a scholar of information and communication technologies, and is especially interested in digital economies and how technology and society shape each other. She earned her Ph.D. from the Institute of Communication Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where her dissertation was supported by a fellowship from the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation. Laila Omar is a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto. Her primary research interests lie in the fields of international migration and qualitative methods, with a special focus on the integration process of refugees and immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa in Canada. As a Fung Global Fellow, she will extend her doctoral research by examining the role of religious identity in the integration process and future projections of recent newcomer youths to North America from that region. Yelena Yermakova is a political philosopher interested in the governance of international spaces and global commons such as the Polar regions, the deep seabed, the atmosphere, outer space and cyberspace. Specifically, her research focuses on which institutions should govern these spaces and what makes these institutions legitimate. She earned her Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Oslo.

National Mall installation invites public to ‘let freedom ring’ By James Dean, Cornell Chronicle August 18, 2023 On the National Mall in Washington starting Aug. 18, a newly assembled carillon will ring out “My Country, ’Tis of Thee,” the patriotic melody cascading down a column of spiraling bronze bells from a height of more than 22 feet. Titled “Let Freedom Ring,” the temporary installation created by Paul Ramírez Jonas, professor and chair of the Art Department in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning, is one of six projects featured in “Pulling Together,” the first exhibition of the Beyond Granite initiative, which aims to create a more inclusive commemorative landscape on the mall. The monthlong exhibition’s name and Ramírez Jonas’ interactive bell tower pay homage to Black opera singer Marian Anderson’s iconic 1939 performance of “My Country, ’Tis of Thee” – also known as “America” – at the Lincoln Memorial, after she was denied access to nearby Constitution Hall. Educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune said the performance told “a story of pulling together, a story of splendor and real democracy.” More than 80 years later, Ramírez Jonas presents another hopeful rendition – by asking the public to complete the song. Pulling a lever, they’ll trigger a hammer inside a 600-pound bell inscribed with “Let freedom ring” to strike song’s the final note, with a force they’ll both hear and feel. “The only person who can finish the melody is you,” Ramírez Jonas said. “The song, like the promise of our country, remains incomplete without participation.” ‘Our monuments must change’ Funded by the Mellon Foundation, “Pulling Together” is co-curated by Paul Farber, director of Philadelphia-based nonprofit Monument Lab, and Salamishah Tillet, a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor at Rutgers University, who prompted the six invited artists – also including Derrick Adams, Tiffany Chung, Ashon T. Crawley, vanessa german and Wendy Red Star – with a question: What stories remain untold on the National Mall? Across the country, Monument Lab’s 2021 audit of nearly 50,000 monuments documented that they depict figures who are overwhelmingly white and male. Among the top 50 individuals represented, half enslaved people, and just 6% are women – with mermaids represented more often than congresswomen. “The opportunity is that I can see all these sides,” he said. “I wanted a monument that’s essentially empty, and it gets filled by whomever walks up to it.” Monumental language Each day, more than 60,000 people are expected to pass “Let Freedom Ring” on an overpass above the 12th Street Expressway, accessible from the Smithsonian Metro stop, near the Smithsonian National Museum of American History and in view of the Washington Monument. Welcoming any of them to complete “America” – which was considered one of several national anthems prior to “The Star-Spangled Banner’s” adoption in 1931 – Ramírez Jonas said the piece speaks to the United States’ ever-changing nature, something not reflected in its monuments. A 600-pound bronze bell is the culmination of “Let Freedom Ring,” designed by Paul Ramírez Jonas, chair of the Art Department in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning. Members of the public pull a lever to ring the bell and complete the melody of “My Country, ’Tis of Thee.” “When it came to monumentality, we took a European model,” he said. “We didn’t invent a language about monumentality that accounts for a country that’s always changing its composition.” “Let Freedom Ring” consists of four Gothic arch-like steel beams that support a vertical pillar holding 32 small bronze bells, arranged in a spiral over the much larger bell anchored to the ground – all cast by a Virginia foundry to sound specific notes in descending order. Ramírez Jonas said form followed function: The physics of suspending heavy bells high up, combined with weather and safety requirements, led to a design that references church bell towers. “You end up with a traditional solution because you’re adapting to the conditions of public space,” Ramírez Jonas said. “Monuments look a certain way for a reason.” Ramírez Jonas reinterprets those forms by encouraging public participation in ways that prompt reflection and more personal connections and meaning. A recurring theme, he said, is his belief that it is daily promises and commitments, small social contracts often taken for granted, that build public trust and bind people together.

UK-based public art project offers any person ‘key to the city’ By James Dean May 19, 2022 At the Birmingham New Street train station in England, a locked door at the end of Platform 1 typically goes unnoticed amid the daily bustle of the city’s busiest commuting hub. Over 10 weeks starting May 28, a key designed by Paul Ramírez Jonas, chair of the Department of Art in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning, will allow thousands of residents and visitors to pass through it, beginning a Harry Potter-like journey deep underground to a service tunnel where green ferns grow beneath fluorescent lights. The site is one of more than 20 public, private and commercial spaces that will be made accessible as part of “Key to the City 2022,” the latest iteration of a public art project Ramírez Jonas has explored on small and large scales over nearly two decades, most notably in New York City in 2010. Together the sites – also including a mosque, museum, restaurant and private garden – present a fresh portrait of the sprawling and diverse industrial city, and raise questions about the nature of public space; about trust, fear and what it means to be a neighbor; and about the role of civic monuments. “We take something symbolic, that claims to be a key to the city, and make it actually open places that represent the city,” Ramírez Jonas said. “And instead of only a few privileged people getting it, any person can give the key to whomever they want, for whatever reason they want.” Birmingham first awarded honorary “freedom of the city” in 1888 to Joseph Chamberlain, the British statesman and former mayor of the city, and fewer than 75 people and military units have received it, according to city records and Wikipedia. Soon, a booth at Birmingham New Street Station will invite visitors to present the honor, in the form of a key, to a friend, loved one or potentially even a stranger. In formal ceremonies, “Key to the City 2022” participants will cross red carpets to a pedestal, state to whom they are awarding a key and why, and record their names in a ledger that will be maintained in city archives. A door at the end of Platform 1 at Birmingham New Street Station in England is one of more than 20 public, private and commercial spaces made accessible to participants in “Key to the City 2022,” created by Paul Ramírez Jonas. In New York, where people waited in lines to claim 19,000 keys to the city (after the mayor temporarily ceded authority to grant them), Ramírez Jonas said those ceremonies often were emotional exchanges. In Birmingham, up to 15,000 participants will receive a Yale key engraved with a hand offering a key on one side and detail from the city’s coat of arms on the other, along with a passport cataloging the sites that agreed to take part in the project. From the service tunnel, keyholders could progress to an office tower for a bird’s-eye view not easily found in the flat city. They could open a cabinet inside a geology museum, or a door tucked in the brick arch of a 230-year-old bridge at the city’s edge. At an Indian restaurant, the chef will share a menu of his mother’s recipes. A mosque will welcome guests to observe prayers. Elsewhere, the key will unlock a side door to a sports stadium, enable passage through a shopping mall on a street gated shut overnight, and provide entry into a family’s small private garden. “They spoke eloquently about the idea of how to be a good neighbor, and it was very moving,” Ramírez Jonas said of the family. “That’s where this project is sometimes sweet, and sometimes has real teeth.” For Ramírez Jonas, “Key to the City 2022” continues a long-standing interest in public monuments. At most statues of prominent historical figures, he said, one sees people eating lunch with their backs to them or skateboarders practicing tricks – evidence that they no longer function as cultural artifacts. What, he wondered, might inspire deeper connections today? “Don’t we want to own our civic symbols?” he said. “The way they become meaningful is through a real sense of ownership and participation. By allowing people to participate with this civic symbol, they also regain ownership of it.”

A Collegetown mural memorializes loved ones lost to illness: Yerkezhan Abuova’s grandmothers both died in Kazakhstan, far from her and under difficult circumstances. But in a bright Collegetown mural, they’re smiling, surrounded by a deer, a rabbit, tulips and waterlilies. “I think it makes my parents happy, because they can see their moms in heaven,” says Abuova ’23, an art major in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning (AAP). “It makes them feel better, like their mothers are watching over me and are happy.” Abuova’s mural is one of 13 in the Dryden Road Garage, including three by other Cornell students. Abuova, who goes by Yerke, worked with Paul Ramírez Jonas, professor of art in AAP, and Caleb Thomas, founder and facilitator of Ithaca Murals, a grassroots organization that helps artists transform Ithaca’s walls into works of art. The mural “Fish and Ballerinas” was painted by Steav Kim ’19 in 2015 in the Dryden Road Garage. The piece is next to a mural by Yerkezhan Abuova ’23. “Murals can bring a sense of a humanity to a blank wall,” Thomas says. “We have successfully shifted our cultural cityscape to reflect the beautiful, diverse people who live here. I’m grateful to Yerke for being part of this cultural shift and honoring this complicated time of COVID-19.” Abuova, whose family is from Kazakhstan, witnessed her parents struggle when their own parents died. Her paternal grandmother, Zhibek Bakhtai Kyzy, died in Kazakhstan in March 2021 from COVID when her breathing tube failed and the hospital didn’t have a replacement. And when her maternal grandmother, Khadisha Kikimbai Kyzy, died in 2018 of various health issues after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease, her mother wasn’t able to return Kazakhstan in time to be with her. “When they both died, it wasn’t the best situation,” says Abuova. “I don’t think my family got closure from that.” Through the mural, she tried to offer that closure to her parents, and to others who have lost loved ones to illness. Abuova began thinking about creating it in spring 2021. With an eye toward making a living as an artist after graduation, she wanted to explore the mural format, imagining an accessible piece. She discovered Ithaca Murals and reached out to Thomas. Then her grandmother died of COVID. “I started thinking about making a memorial, because I think a lot of people can relate to that right now,” she says. Working from photographs, she sketched a design using colored pencils and collaborated with Thomas to find a location. In April, she applied to the City of Ithaca for permission to paint at the Dryden Road Garage, which was approved in August. Ishan Ethridge ’24 painted “Mechanical Doodles” in the Dryden Road Garage in 2020. The piece is next to a mural by Steav Kim ’19, who created “Fish and Ballerinas” in 2015. Ishan Ethridge ’24 painted “Mechanical Doodles” and “Snail” in the garage in 2020. Abuova began working on the mural during the fall semester as an independent study, with Ramírez Jonas as an adviser. Ramírez Jonas, who specializes in public art, came to the garage weekly to see her progress and discuss readings on public art and artists. “In my mind, he really expanded what a mural could be,” she says. The project stretched her as an artist, Abuova says. She usually works in the studio, using oil paints on standard-sized canvases. It was tough getting used to the larger scale. “When the painting works well from far away, it looks strange up close, and vice versa,” she says. It was the first time she had used exterior house paint – donated by Ithaca Murals – which dries faster than oils. And during one work session, she had been painting for three hours when rain washed away her progress. “I learned working outside of an art studio, your canvas is much more difficult,” she says. “I think now I can do anything.” Her aim with the mural was to focus on the positive, she said. “The goal was for the mural to be a happy addition to the garage and serve as a memorial for my grandmothers,” she says. “And people can see their own grandmas and loved ones within the mural too.”

Columbus art explores the world’s entrenched colonialism By Blaine Friedlander September 27, 2021 At Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana, text on a silver flagpole tells of Horace King, a black enslaved architect and engineer who successfully built the first bridge – in 1833 – that crossed the Chattahoochee River from Columbus, Georgia, into Alabama. Nearby, 57 other poles tell more narratives and offer reflections on places around the world named directly or indirectly for Christopher Columbus. It’s not all flattering. Together the poles make up the outdoor art installation, “Columbus Columbia Colombo Colón,” now on display until Nov. 28. It connects places around the world named for Columbus to prompt contemplation; it was designed and built by faculty members Jennifer Newsom and Tom Carruthers, from Cornell’s College of Architecture, Art and Planning. “In the Columbus name, you see an oscillation between a thing and an action,” said Newsom, an assistant professor. “The installation ‘Columbus, Columbia, Columbia Colón’ is stating the obvious: There is a kind of entrenched colonial presence in North and South America that extends to influence the entire world. Stories are inscribed on each of the 58 poles that connect places named for Christopher Columbus at Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana. “The installation is trying to speak to the multiplicity of ways in which we contend with these historical trajectories that also are very evident in the present day,” Newsom said. “These are all marking current place names in the landscape.” The city of Columbus, Indiana, located between Indianapolis and Lexington, Kentucky, boasts a notable hotbed of architectural and artistic verve. The city is awash in buildings designed by famous architects: I.M. Pei created the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library, while Gunnar Bikerts designed the town’s Lincoln Elementary School and Saint Peter’s Lutheran Church. The town’s fire stations were designed by Robert Venturi, William Burd, Leighton Bowers, Susana Torre and William Rawn. Carruthers and Newsom – the principals in the architectural firm Dream the Combine – won the 2021 J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize; with the prize came the opportunity to design a piece of public art. Given the scale of Columbus, Indiana, as a city, Newsom and Carruthers related the Columbus name to the civic environment. “‘Columbus’ was kind of a poem and a metaphor,” said Carruthers, a professor of the practice. “It is a crater on Mars, a space shuttle, a module on the International Space Station, a movie, a backstory, an opera, a television network, a sausage company, a bike frame, a bus system, a sculpture, a cruise ship. It becomes so synonymous, so what does ‘Columbus’ actually mean?” For example, Newsom points out that the installation’s District of Columbia pole features a poem by Phillis Wheatley, a well-known, enslaved Revolutionary War-era poet born in West Africa, who first linked the female embodiment of Columbia to the United States. The exhibit’s 58 flag poles bring out the “spiral text” of stories, counterpoints and metaphors to induce a dizzying reading movement, that has a choregraphed, performative aspect, said Carruthers. “We are encouraging people to get inside the installation, to learn and to move through the texts,” Newsom said. On the Columbus, Georgia, pole, the installation notes Horace King later bought his own freedom and established a successful bridge building company. “Horace King’s life soars above the murky waters of historical limitations, of human bondage and racial prejudice,” the pole’s text notes, quoting King’s eulogy. “He did not change the currents of social history, but he did transcend them.”

NYC urban design course technology recaptures humanity By Blaine Friedlander May 27, 2021 At the heart of Long Island City – across the East River from midtown Manhattan – sits the Queensboro Plaza subway stop. It’s a long, elevated platform featuring nothing but steel beams, rails and trains. Beneath the station, crossing the boulevard is not for the meek, as pedestrians hope to cross the fat streets in time to elude speeding cars and trucks. Above, the trains rumble and generate a ceaseless cacophony of high-decibel noise. In partnership with faculty from Cornell’s Department of City and Regional Planning, in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning (AAP), along with faculty and students from Cornell Tech, Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute students have been taking a pilot Cornell course this semester – Urban Design Strategies and Case Studies. Using New York City as their laboratory, the students incorporate augmented-reality (AR) and virtual-reality (VR) into a technology driven tangible world. The result: a return of humanity. “With the Queensboro Plaza area, the students have researched how to make an inviting, safer place,” said Robert Balder ’89, executive director of the Gensler Family AAP NYC. Balder was the creator and faculty co-instructor for the course, which is part of the core-curriculum for the new Jacobs Urban Tech concentration. He co-taught the class with Sharon Yavo Ayalon, Technion B.Arch ’01, M.Sc ’10, Ph.D. ’19, postdoctoral associate at Cornell Tech. Ron Brachman, professor of computer science and the director of Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, worked with Balder and Ayalon to develop the course. Each of the course’s four student teams engaged with a New York City Business Improvement District, or a BID. In addition to the Long Island City partnership, the students focused on the Flatiron/23rd Street Partnership in Manhattan, where district boundaries are expanding; the Village Alliance, with a focus on University Place, a road connecting Union Square and Washington Square Park in Manhattan; and the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership. The students provided final presentations on May 20. As for the Long Island City team, the group proposed pedestrian-friendly walkways with improved lighting and safety, more space for relaxation – during the lunch hour, for example – in elevated space featuring art, benches and a view. Using an off-the-shelf Unity game engine – learned during the class – the team created a virtual reality demonstration to show the different phases of the possible project. Chris Morse, M. Arch ’16, visiting lecturer, led the Unity training throughout the semester. “We created the VR demonstration to convey our idea in an immersive way to different stakeholders,” said student Matan Amihai, a Long Island City team member. “This helps them better understand how our intervention can create a better and necessary urban environment for pedestrians.” While the LED lights are bright on Broadway, the Flatiron/23rd Street Partnership aims to fuse technology and art to project animated lights on the historic buildings – using the buildings as canvas – along the Broadway corridor south of Times Square. Their idea aims to showcase historic buildings and architecture, use AR on smartphones to increase the foot traffic at local eateries and shops, engage creative institutions, identify local neighborhood assets and promote pedestrian safety. Sometimes, it takes a Village Alliance. This student team took a strategic approach to encourage engagement along the University Place corridor. Thus, instead of asking people what they want, the team wants to empower people with the resources to self-organize projects most beneficial to them. The group created a gamified mobile application that allows community members to take ownership. They community can start pop-up projects that are crowdfunded, provide personalized reviews for street infrastructure, and communicate with other visitors, businesses and local authorities. The “Village Alliance App” team members are Dana Taub, Kaiyuan Deng, Jagan Subramanian, Leticia Mendes, Sanket Shah. In the heart of Downtown Brooklyn, one student team noticed new residents moving into Brooklyn, as the Fulton Street corridor goes through a renaissance. The team sought ways to tell this story. The solution: A wayfinding application that features AR on their new “Midday in Brooklyn” app. Learn the history of Brooklyn, understand the present and peek into the future. The team: Jeanne Li, Lars Kouwenhoven, Jiadong Lou, Alex Amy and Merav Tal-maon. The environment itself is changing and design needs to adapt. “Technology and more advanced tools such as VR/AR, 3D modelling and printing, light, temperature and sound simulations,” Ayalon said, “and tools such as Unity, can help us plan better and more balanced environments.”

NYC workshop tackles how to build sustainable cities By Kate Frazer June 1, 2017 Deteriorating infrastructure, rising seas and more frequent extreme weather events are challenging today’s engineers, architects and urban planners like never before. On May 23, more than 60 people gathered at the College of Architecture, Art and Planning’s (AAP) studio space in New York City to consider how built environments can help meet these challenges. The one-day workshop, “Rebuilding the Built Environment,” was organized by Cornell’s Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future and AAP NYC. “Designing built environments not only requires physical resilience in the face of these threats but social and economic resilience as well,” said Kieran Donaghy, the Atkinson Center’s faculty director of economic development and one of the workshop organizers. “To survive and to thrive in coming years, cities and infrastructure must adapt to changing patterns of settlement and production, preserve cultural and natural values, and be economically sustainable,” he said. “Our goal was to bring together academics, design and engineering professionals, and civic leaders to consider questions of how to rebuild our environments differently.” To take the concept from idea to reality, Donaghy worked with Robert Balder, the Gensler Family Sesquicentennial Executive Director of AAP NYC, to arrange a day of collaboration structured around five topics: best-practice engineering responses to climate change; large-scale developments that meet concerns of social equity and environmental integrity; current and pending government infrastructure policies; financing infrastructural investments; and identifying a research agenda and collaborative opportunities. Each moderated panel focused on specific programmatic needs, best practices and opportunities for collaboration between stakeholders and university partners. “There are many ongoing efforts to study new technologies and institutional arrangements that hold promise for effectively responding to 21st-century threats,” said Balder. “But lack of meaningful reinvestment, outdated zoning and weak financial incentives for private sector investments leave many communities facing a double threat of decaying infrastructure and climate change impacts.” Donaghy and Balder hoped the workshop would capitalize on the initiative many local organizations and individuals have shown in stepping up to fill the leadership vacuum and promote resilience in their communities. Workshop participants learned about projects like BuroHappold Engineering’s work on a vision for New Jersey’s Gateway National Recreation Area, which includes the restoration and protection of Long Island’s Jamaica Bay and its environs, and ReThink Studio’s plan for a fully renovated Pennsylvania Station with an expanded regional rail network. Another project that attracted interest among participants was a collaboration among Jonathan Rose Cos., Handel Architects and New York City’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development on a new 751,000-square-foot mixed-use development in East Harlem that will provide affordable housing while becoming one of the largest “passive house” projects in the world. “We have an opportunity to create infrastructure and communities that are not just suitable today, but serve social, environmental and economic needs well into the future,” said Balder. “My hope is that participants continue the dialogue and remain committed to challenging each of us to do more to implement long-term solutions.” “Cornell fosters connections and world-class academic research that directly impact people’s lives,” said Donaghy. “This influence will grow with the opening of Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island in September, which promises to create unprecedented opportunities for conversations and collaborations among academics, entrepreneurs, investors and others to explore and pursue strategies to rebuild built environments.”

Cornell researchers’ “leaf-level” visualization of every tree in New York City – and how much shade each provides – could inform new strategies for mitigating extreme heat there, and in other cities coping with record-breaking temperatures. Tree Folio NYC creates a “digital twin” of New York’s urban canopy. The high-resolution, 3D model not only details trees’ location, type and size, but simulates how local conditions such as street orientation, street width and building height influence their shading benefits. For decades, cities have planted trees in uniform rows along streets. But improved understanding of how tree placement impacts shading could help planners plant and maintain trees more strategically to maximize climate benefits and distribute them equitably, said Alex Kobald, project lead and associate director of the Design Across Scales Lab in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning (AAP). “We’re trying to better understand the relationship between a tree and its local environment,” Kobald said, “and how that local environment impacts the benefits a tree can provide.” The lab led by J. Meejin Yoon, B.Arch. ’95, the Gale and Ira Drukier Dean of AAP, investigates spatial, social, and environmental challenges at the intersection of the built environment, ecology, and technology. Tree Folio, NYC explores the street tree and urban canopy as a form of city infrastructure. The project was developed with students and funding from the Design Across Scales Lab at AAP and the Urban Tech Hub, part of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech. Kobald has shared early versions with municipal agencies and policy advocates, and said the open-source tool could be scaled to other cities using publicly available data. “Extreme heat is one of the most acute and lethal risks of climate change, especially for cities, and we have deployable solutions now,” Kobald said. “In cities around the world, urban trees are vital infrastructure for confronting extreme heat events exacerbated by climate change.” The model is constructed from New York City’s most recent 2021 3D aerial scan of the five boroughs using lidar sensing, short for light detection and ranging. The researchers developed a method to extract the urban forest from the high-resolution survey of the built environment, creating an interactive map of trees viewable from any angle, each a cluster of green data points that resemble leaves. The lidar scan is linked to the city’s 2015 tree census, which counted more than 666,000 public, curbside trees greening more than 131,000 blocks. Clicking on any tree reveals its address, species, health status, height, canopy radius and trunk diameter, and a planned folio tool would allow comparisons with like trees – honey locusts, say, or pin oaks – in the same ZIP code. Most importantly, Tree Folio, NYC enables users to simulate the shade any street tree produces over an entire year, computing the extent to which it shades public ground or building facades, or lives entirely in shadow itself – thus adding no net cooling benefit. The difference can be seen in a comparison of three neighborhoods that share similar physical characteristics – building heights, street widths and number of trees – but differ in street orientations, socioeconomic status and heat vulnerability indexes. Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Pelham Gardens in the Bronx and Ozone Park in Queens, Kobald said, have similar numbers of trees but vary drastically in quality and impact. Because trees are larger and more evenly distributed in Park Slope and Pelham Gardens, those neighborhoods see more beneficial shading on streets and buildings. Ozone Park also is significantly more exposed on east-west streets where summer afternoon heat is most intense, increasing its vulnerability. Tree Folio, NYC combines AAP’s spatial understanding of urban data and the environment producing it, Kobald said, and the Urban Tech Hub’s experience working with complex data on a very large scale – some 600 gigabytes involving 150 billion points extracted from 1,800 lidar files. “It’s been a fantastic collaboration,” he said. Yoon concurred and shared how critical the collaboration was to showcasing how open source data sets can be used, analyzed, and built upon to provide new tools for more equitable and impactful climate mitigation strategies.

Few in US recognize inequities of climate change By Tom Fleischman, Cornell Chronicle August 9, 2023FacebookTwitterEmailShare Despite broad scientific consensus that climate change has more serious consequences for some groups – particularly those already socially or economically disadvantaged – a large swath of people in the U.S. doesn’t see it that way. A recent national survey study found that just over one-third of U.S. adults believe climate change is impacting some groups more than others. Nearly half feel that climate change impacts all groups about equally. And when the question referenced race in climate impacts, even fewer people believed some groups are more adversely affected than others. “Our earlier research showed that the American public misperceives who is concerned about environmental issues, and we’re wondering why that’s the case,” said Jonathon Schuldt ’04, associate professor of communication in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and executive director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability,” concluded that human-induced climate change “has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability. … Across sectors and regions the most vulnerable people and systems are observed to be disproportionately affected.” For this study, Schuldt and Pearson – who were co-authors last year on a study proposing that misperceptions of others’ concerns about COVID-19, climate change and other issues are a form of social misinformation that can undermine the trust needed to address global threats – analyzed data from two national surveys they conducted in May and August-September 2022. For the first study, the question posed to 1,084 respondents was, “Do you think that climate change affects some groups more than others, or does it affect all groups about equally?” In the second study, a total of 1,017 respondents were randomly assigned either the original question or one of two alternative questions: “Do you think that climate change affects some groups in the U.S. more than others, or does it affect all groups in the U.S. about equally?” or “Do you think that climate change affects some racial groups more than others, or does it affect all racial groups about equally?” For the first study, just 37% of respondents felt climate change impacts some groups more than others; 46% felt it affected all groups about equally, and 17% weren’t sure. For the second study, when the question included the term “racial groups,” just 22% felt some groups were affected more than others. Fifty-seven percent felt all racial groups were affected about equally. Democrats were more likely than Republicans, and younger people more likely than older people, to believe climate change affected some groups more than others. Still, Schuldt said, the misperceptions exist across all groups. “It’s still only a minority of Democrats who are choosing the ‘some more than others’ response, which is the correct response,” he said. “That’s a little surprising to us. It does seem like there is this sort of ‘common threat’ or ‘great equalizer’ perception when it comes to climate change, that may prevent people from seeing or acknowledging these inequities.” The biggest surprise, he said, was that when race was included in the question, the belief that some groups were more affected than others was so much weaker. “That’s remarkable to us, because race is a robust social predictor of exposure to climate-related hazards,” Schuldt said. “It suggests that calling attention to one of the main factors that puts people at risk might actually backfire.” “We know a lot about Americans’ climate change attitudes, but we know relatively little about their perceptions of climate injustice,” he said. “We think there’s a need for survey researchers to study these in more depth, so that we can track them over time and see how well they predict support for policy aimed at reducing climate inequities in the years to come.”

Carbon dioxide – not water – triggers explosive volcanoes By Blaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle August 7, 2023 Geoscientists have long thought that water – along with shallow magma stored in Earth’s crust – drives volcanoes to erupt. Now, thanks to newly developed research tools at Cornell, scientists have learned that gaseous carbon dioxide can trigger explosive eruptions. A new model suggests that basaltic volcanoes, typically located on the interior of tectonic plates, are fed by a deep magma within the mantle, stored about 20 to 30 kilometers below Earth’s surface. The research, which offers a clearer picture of our planet’s deep internal dynamics and composition, with implications for improving volcanic-hazards planning, was published Aug. 7 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “We used to think all the action happened in the crust,” said senior author Esteban Gazel, the Charles N. Mellowes Professor in Engineering in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. “Our data implies the magma comes directly from the mantle – passing fast through the crust ¬– driven by the exsolution (the process phase of separating gas from liquid) of carbon dioxide. “This completely changes the paradigm of how these eruptions happen,” Gazel said. “All volcanic models had been dominated by water as the main eruption driver, but water has little to do with these volcanoes. It’s carbon dioxide that brings this magma from the deep Earth.” About four years ago, Gazel and Charlotte DeVitre, Ph.D. ’22, now a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Berkeley, developed a high-precision carbon dioxide densimeter (which measures density in a tiny vessel) for Raman spectroscopy (a device that examines scattered photons through a microscope). The Fogo volcano on the Cape Verde islands erupts in November 2014. The natural samples – microscopic-sized carbon dioxide rich bubbles trapped in crystals emanating from the volcanic eruption – are then measured via Raman and quantified applying the newly developed densimeter. Essentially, the scientists are examining a microscopic time capsule to provide a history of the magma. This new technique is critical for near real-time precise estimations of magma storage, tested during the 2021 eruption in La Palma, in the Canary Islands by Gazel’s group. Further, the scientists developed methods to assess the effect of laser heating on carbon-dioxide rich inclusions (found swathed in the crystals), and to accurately assess melt inclusion and bubble volumes. They also developed an experimental reheating method to increase accuracy and properly account for carbon dioxide trapped as carbonate crystals inside the bubbles. “The method of development and instrument design were challenging, especially during the height of the pandemic,” Gazel said. “As deep magma storage will not be detected by ground deformation until the melt is close to surface,” he said, “this has important repercussions to our understanding of volcanic hazards. We need to understand the drivers of these eruptions. The only way to see these processes now is by observing earthquakes, but earthquakes don’t tell you exactly what’s happening.” Said Gazel: “With precise measurements that tell us where eruptions start, where magmas melt and where they are stored – and what triggers the eruption – we can develop a much better plan for future eruptions.” In addition to Gazel and DeVitre, the other authors of “Oceanic Intraplate Explosive Eruptions Fed Directly from the Mantle” are Ricardo S.

Staff Stories: Helen Lee Behind operations at Cornell Wildlife Health Center By Grace DePaull August 7, 2023 Living in Seattle, Washington, Helen Lee ’03, MBA '20, is surrounded by nature – lakes, oceans, beaches and the snow-capped ridges of the Olympic Mountains, which she sees from her window every morning. Her surroundings are a constant reminder that her work directly impacts the world around her, even while residing 2,700 miles west of Cornell, where she currently works as the assistant director of wildlife health and health policy at the College of Veterinary Medicine. In her current role, Lee helps manage the strategies, programs and operations for the Cornell Wildlife Health Center while also serving as a conservation and livelihoods advisor on field projects. Her work ranges from fundraising, marketing and communications to managing programs, projects and partnerships. She even conducts her own research. “I do a little of everything,” Lee said. “I love the diversity of my responsibilities because it keeps me engaged and intellectually challenged while tapping into many different skill sets. I’ve found a job where I really feel like I'm making a difference and helping educate people about the importance of wildlife and conservation.” Lee has found her happy place – having one foot in the business world and one in the science world. While her passion for wildlife began at a young age, spending hours observing insects and other critters in her backyard and devouring every wildlife book at her local library, her interest in business management emerged only after exploring it in college. “I ended up veering off the veterinary path and became really fascinated by the psychology of working with teams and understanding and influencing people’s behaviors,” Lee said. Lee graduated from Cornell with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Economics and Management from the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. Upon graduating, she pursued a career in the corporate sector, working as a district manager for Aldi. After nearly four years of working in this role, Lee began to feel as though something was missing. She quit her job to pursue a career that aligned with her passion for wildlife conservation and left the corporate world behind. Lee spent the next ten years at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), where she became the assistant director of wildlife health and oversaw global projects across 25 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. While at WCS, Lee developed connections throughout these countries and within the organization – one of which led her back to Cornell. In 2017, when Lee’s previous manager at WCS approached her about creating a new center of excellence around wildlife health and conservation at the university, she jumped at the opportunity. “I enjoyed working at WCS, and I really believed in the mission,” Lee said. “But this offered a different challenge. Helping to create and build something from the ground up was exciting to me. It was a meaningful step for the next stage of my professional growth – to help start something new.” The Cornell Wildlife Health Center, which launched in March 2020, is an applied research center that prioritizes catalyzing policy change in support of sustainable and holistic solutions to address challenges impacting wildlife, livestock, human and environmental health worldwide. Currently, work is underway in North America, Asia and Africa. Making these kinds of global interconnections is what motivates Lee in her work at the Cornell Wildlife Health Center and is something she believes is critical to conservation efforts moving forward. “I love being part of a team that is trying to advocate for wild species that can’t advocate for themselves,” Lee said. “But the clock is ticking. We’re in the midst of the sixth mass extinction on our planet – primarily driven by human activity – and seeing the accelerating disappearance of wildlife is distressing. It’s important to take action because we’re all interconnected and dependent on healthy ecosystems. We have a collective responsibility to take care of this shared planet and make more sustainable choices whenever we can.”

Young African leaders find inspiration, confidence at Cornell By Caitlin Hayes, Cornell Chronicle August 4, 2023 When Alice Igisaro began practicing as a dental surgeon in her native Rwanda in 2020, she was immediately frustrated by the number of patients with advanced disease – they hadn’t sought help in time or had gone first to traditional healers, or they had not been properly referred by their community health centers. Igisaro saw solutions – educating rural communities and health workers – and began pursuing changes that would have systemic impact. But as a clinician, she felt isolated and stymied by expectations that, especially as a young woman, she accept the status quo.  , Click to open gallery view Credit:Jason Koski/Cornell University Fellows interact with students and staff from the Community Unity Music Education Program on Nelson Mandela International Day, July 18. After spending the last six weeks at Cornell as a Mandela Washington Fellow, Igisaro said she’s found new confidence in herself and hope for her country and the continent. The Mandela Washington Fellowship for young African leaders is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State; this summer a cohort of 25 Fellows was hosted by the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy and the Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies. “When you see other young people who are hopeful, who are working toward something, it gives me so much hope,” Igisaro said. “Now I know I’m not the only one, and now I have networks – in the U.S. and in Africa. I really believe in our future collaboration and the strength of how people think in our cohort. I believe in us as young leaders of Africa.” “Our core mission is education for a global world,” said Rachel Beatty Riedl, director of the Einaudi Center and the center’s John S. Knight Professor of International Studies, as well as professor in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Brooks School. “We seek to equip our students with the skills, knowledge base and critical thinking to address the challenges we face today and in the future. The Mandela Washington Fellows program is built upon that ethos, and the fellows are truly inspirational in their commitments and contributions. Our Cornell community and Ithaca community benefit from the bright light they shine.” Cornell is one of 28 U.S. institutions – and the only Ivy League school – to host  this year’s Mandela Washington Fellowship, the flagship program of the State Department’s Young African Leaders Initiative, with a total of 700 African leaders between the ages of 25 and 35 participating this summer. The State Department has supported nearly 5,800 fellows since 2014. This is the first year Cornell has received the award and hosted a group of fellows. Cornell’s fellows had a packed schedule of intense academic coursework, leadership training, networking and volunteering, as well as meetings with faculty, alumni and graduate student mentors, elected officials, university administration and community leaders. Fellows said the interdisciplinary coursework and their peers broadened their perspectives. “I’ve learned to be very open-minded and to think outside the box,” said Kelebogile Lefhoko, a medical doctor from Botswana. “Literally everything we’ve talked about affects health – climate, sustainability, government. These are things we didn’t get to talk about in medical school.” Fellows gather for an opening reception on Uris Terrace. Fellows also said having the chance to develop themselves as leaders, to identify their strengths, was revelatory. “Just noticing how you as a person are a resource – it’s life-changing,” Lefhoko said. “Outside of any external resources, I have my own strengths as a leader, which are a resource all their own. That will definitely guide me in anything that I do.” Mentors helped fellows develop focus projects to implement upon returning to their home countries; Igisaro will leverage existing health care infrastructure to train health care workers who have direct access to rural communities. Lefhoko plans to work with a support group for patients with autoimmune diseases to elevate research and find the best ways to advocate for patients.

Floating an energy idea: Scientists study solar panel-topped ponds By Blaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle August 3, 2023 Earth is running out of room. Modern society demands food and sustainable energy, so science has an idea: To preserve agricultural land for crops and conservation lands for wildlife, place floating photovoltaic panels on lakes, rivers and reservoirs. The problem: No one has fully defined how acres of panel-topped bodies of water affect biologic aquatic systems, but Cornell and U.S. Geological Survey ecologist Steve Grodsky – and a multidisciplinary team of researchers – soon will learn. Credit:Jason Koski/Cornell University Steve Grodsky, assistant professor, samples arthropods on a solar panel-covered pond at the Cornell Experimental Pond Facility. Since the middle of June, Grodsky and a small group of students have linked 378 solar panels and 1,600 floats – by hand, one-at-a-time – across three ponds at the Cornell Experimental Pond Facility, adjacent to the Ithaca airport. The three-year project is funded by the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. “We need renewable energy to mitigate climate change, and we need room to grow food and support ecosystem services,” said principal investigator Grodsky, assistant professor (courtesy) of natural resources and the environment in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and a faculty fellow at Cornell Atkinson. “If we partially cover lakes and reservoirs with solar panels, how can we do it in a smart, sustainable way? That’s what we’re going to find out.” Specifically, the project will examine how floating solar panels on the research ponds affect the abiotic and biotic parts of water; and how microbes, macroinvertebrates (snails and crayfish), macrophytes (aquatic plants) and fish fare. The researchers will track the ponds’ greenhouse gas emissions, summertime algae growth, bioacoustics and environmental DNA. Cornell scientists joining Grodsky as co-principal investigators are: 1.	Meredith Holgerson, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology (CALS), whose research indicates that ponds are known to emit carbon dioxide and methane; 2.	Marian Schmidt, assistant professor of microbiology (CALS), who will study how the panels affect the microbial ecology in the ponds; 3.	Aaron Rice, researcher, K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CALS), who will help examine how the panels affect the bioacoustics in the ponds. Ciel & Terre, a French company that specializes in developing floating solar panels, is partnering with the researchers. The company has deployed about 280 such projects around the world. Grodsky said interest in water-borne solar panels is rising.  Last December, Rep. Paul Tonko (D-New York) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-California) introduced the “Protect our Waters and Expand Renewables on our Reservoirs Act,” known as the “POWER our Reservoirs Act,” which would spare land, possibly reduce harmful algal blooms, advance clean energy production on federal water reservoirs and examine the deployment of floating solar to create renewable energy. Citing reports from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the proposed law said that deploying floating solar panels on reservoirs could save 5 million acres of land and meet 10% of the country’s electricity needs. Adding solar panels to a pond in July, Steve Grodsky, left, and doctoral student Caitlin Davis aim to understand how floating photovoltaic panels affect the biology of the water. In late July, postdoctoral researcher Nicholas Ray, masters student Tess Canino and Jera Jansen ‘25 began to examine the carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations emanating from the ponds. From a sustainability perspective, it’s important to understand the effects on ecosystems, Grodsky said: “It’s not about slowing down renewable energy development; it’s about incorporating scientific rigor to make the deployment of floating solar development more sustainable.” With today’s energy transitioning to renewable, science must incorporate sustainability from the start, Grodsky said. “If we dive right in, we may find unintended consequences down the road. In addition to Ray, Canino and Jansen, assisting with the panel construction on the ponds were: Benjamin Sterrett, manager of the Cornell Experimental Ponds; Tim Boycott, Trifosa Simamora and Caitlin Davis doctoral students in natural resources and the environment; Sheen Dwyer-McNulty ’23; and Dave Grodsky.

Undergrads relish challenging Nexus Scholar research projects: This summer Blythe Wong ’25 has been “fishing for answers” to understand how genes and hormones shape the way organisms look and behave, working with thousands of tiny Poecilia parae fish swimming in the aquariums of Ben Sandkam’s lab in Mudd Hall. Sandkam in an assistant professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior in the College of Arts & Sciences. Wong has not only been interacting directly with the fish — breeding and feeding them — but has also been working at the molecular level to extract RNA, separate DNA and develop new assays for gene expression. Blythe Wong '25 feeds some of the thousands of Poecilia parae fish in Assistant Professor Ben Sandkam's lab in Mudd Hall. “As someone who's into marine biology, being able to work with fish is very exciting,” said Wong, who’s majoring in biology with a concentration in microbiology and interests in genetics. “This position is perfect for me because it combines the test organism that I'm the most interested in with the type of research I want to do.” Wong is one of 101 Nexus Scholars who spent eight weeks this summer working with researchers on campus on projects in the humanities, social sciences and physical sciences. From compiling oral histories of Asian-American Cornellians to using artificial intelligence to find patterns in New York Times obituaries to studying genetic diversity in fish, student research this summer was broad and deep. The Nexus Scholar Program, in its second summer, offers students the chance to work with a Cornell research lab, join in weekly career development and networking sessions and form a cohort of other students interested in research. Scholars presented their research at a July 26 event to celebrate the end of their summer projects, though many plan to continue with their labs during the fall semester. "The Nexus Scholars program provides meaningful opportunities for undergraduate students, and faculty and their research groups. It is amazing to watch students start the summer a bit unsure about research and end it by confidently explaining and owning their projects, and describing how the skills they learned will be useful for their future careers," said Michelle Smith, senior associate dean for undergraduate education and the Ann S. Bowers Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. "A&S is enormously proud of the students and so grateful to the research mentors for providing these opportunities."

Silver fly takes flight in the fight to save Fall Creek hemlocks By Anna Hooper Cornell Botanic Gardens July 25, 2023 Researchers are hoping a fly no larger than a grain of rice and a predatory beetle may work together to combat an invasive pest that is devastating hemlocks in Fall Creek and throughout eastern North America. Cornell Botanic Gardens staff and Cornell’s New York State Hemlock Initiative released 700 silver flies in the Fall Creek South Natural Area in June. The team hopes the silver flies, and a beetle released there in 2022, may offer a long-term biological solution to the hemlock woolly adelgid, which poses one of the most significant risks for hemlock populations. While both species have been released in Cornell Botanic Gardens before, Fall Creek South is the first area where both will exist together, offering researchers insights into whether they will successfully fight the hemlock woolly adelgid. The aphid-like species clings to hemlock branches and pierces the fine twigs to feed on the tree’s sap. This disrupts the tree’s flow of vital nutrients to its canopy, ultimately leading to the tree’s death. The insect has the potential to decimate hemlock forests – including the hundreds that reside in the Fall Creek area. Ranging from saplings to 300-year-old trees, hemlocks are the foundation species that shape the area’s hydrology, temperature and species composition, said Todd Bittner, director of natural areas for Cornell Botanic Gardens. “The hemlocks are iconic to these woods,” Bittner said. “Hemlocks are absolutely necessary for maintaining this ecosystem and the biodiversity it supports.” The hemlock plays a crucial role in the area’s ecosystem. Its dense canopy creates a cool, shaded habitat suitable for specific plants and animals to thrive. Its branching roots filter water and reduce soil erosion, increasing water quality. The tree’s dense shade also delays snow melt in the spring, which provides stream-flows needed for trout and other fish. Native to the American Northwest, both the beetle, Laricobius nigrinus, and the silver fly, Leucotaraxis piniperda, hunt adelgids and are naturally suited for a colder climate. Similar to its prey, the silver fly also reproduces twice a year, meaning it can feed on hemlock woolly adelgids as the pests reproduce. “You have these predators that are essentially feeding on the same thing,” said Nick Dietschler, research support specialist from the hemlock initiative. “In our research, we are trying to understand the niche specialization between the two species. Because they’ve co-evolved with each other, they’re likely going to find the same niches here on the East Coast as in their native Northwest.” Cornell Botanic Gardens’ natural area stewards have protected more than 2,000 trees with insecticide bark applications and trunk injections in 15 natural areas. In anticipation of biocontrol introduction, staff strategically left some hemlocks untreated. These trees will allow hemlock woolly adelgid populations to remain stable enough for predator populations to adequately establish themselves with a steady supply of food. The short-term goal is for the predators to remain for three years, marking their establishment in the area. Researchers hope that the silver fly, a strong flier, will spread in time and aid hemlocks in the surrounding area. Because pesticide applications last five to seven years, many trees in Fall Creek will approach insecticide reapplication within the next few years. Currently, the team plans to reassess the area in 2024, which would allow predator populations time to establish a presence there; that will help the team determine if pesticides are still required after the biocontrol agents have been released. The long-term conservation plan for Fall Creek will depend on several factors, including predator establishment, hemlock woolly adelgid populations and the condition of the trees. Despite the uncertainty, the mission remains steady: to conserve as many hemlock trees as possible, Bittner says. “If in 100 years, we have hundreds of hemlocks in this area, that’s a success.”

Red algae proteins grafted into tobacco double plant growth By Krisy Gashler College of Agriculture and Life Sciences July 25, 2023 A Cornell researcher and her colleagues have solved one key piece of the molecular puzzle needed to dramatically improve plant productivity and increase carbon sequestration: They have successfully transferred key regions of a highly efficient red algae into a tobacco plant, using bacteria as an intermediary. The study was co-authored by Laura Gunn, assistant professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science Plant Biology Section in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and featured on the cover of the June 8 issue of Nature Plants. The study centers on Rubisco, the most abundant protein across every ecosystem on Earth. Rubisco performs the first step of photosynthesis by fixing carbon, and it appears in various forms in a wide array of organisms, including plants, red and green algae and bacteria. Rubisco is slow and struggles to differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide, a problem Gunn and several other Cornellians are working on. As a result, Rubisco often limits plant growth and crop yield. One species of red algae, Griffithsia monilis (Gm), contains Rubisco that is 30% more efficient at fixing carbon than Rubisco in other organisms, including terrestrial crops. For at least 20 years, scientists have been interested in transplanting the highly efficient GmRubisco into plants such as rice, wheat, soybean and tobacco to increase their productivity; however, until now, no one has been able to successfully coax plants to express it. This is because Rubisco requires multiple “chaperones” that are essential for the protein to fold, assemble and be active  – there are seven such helpers in tobacco plants – and most of the chaperones in red algae are unknown, Gunn said. In their study, Gunn and her co-authors were able to solve the 3D structure of GmRubisco and use this information to successfully graft a small number of regions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsRubisco) into a bacterial Rubisco. “RsRubisco is not very efficient, but it is very closely related to GmRubisco – they’re like cousins – which means that unlike land-plant Rubisco, it accepts the grafted sequences,” Gunn said. “RsRubisco also doesn't need any special chaperones for it to fold and assemble in land plants.” The change increased the carboxylation rate – the speed at which Rubisco starts the carbon fixation process – by 60%, increased carboxylation efficiency by 22% and improved RsRubisco’s ability to distinguish between carbon dioxide and oxygen by 7%. The authors then transplanted their bacterial mutant into tobacco, where it doubled photosynthesis and plant growth, compared to tobacco grown with unaltered RsRubisco. Tobacco is the easiest land plant in which to manipulate Rubisco and so serves as the test case for developing a more efficient Rubisco that can be transferred to more agronomically relevant species, Gunn said. “We’re not at the point where we’re outperforming wild-type tobacco, but we’re on the right trajectory,” Gunn said. “We only need fairly modest improvements to Rubisco performance, because even a very small increase over a whole growing season can lead to massive changes in plant growth and yield, and the potential applications span many sectors: higher agricultural production; more efficient and affordable biofuel production; carbon sequestration approaches; and artificial energy possibilities.” The research was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis, Formas Future Research Leaders and the European Regional Development Fund.

Blamed for fouling the environment, polyester may help save it By Blaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle July 18, 2023 More than a decade ago, jet-lagged textile expert Juan Hinestroza landed in Xintang, China, and took a walk near a large creek. He noticed the water was a strange color – indigo blue, from highly toxic dyes, pigments and finishes dumped from a neighboring textile factory. “People’s faces appeared blue. The houses were blue. The air was blue. Textile plants throw contaminants in the rivers – where people swim, where people get their drinking and cooking water,” says Hinestroza, the Rebecca Q. Morgan ’60 Professor of Fiber Science and Apparel Design in the College of Human Ecology. Juan Hinestroza in the Human Ecology Building. Now Hinestroza and a multidisciplinary team of Cornell chemists and engineers are reaching into a chemistry toolbox to clean up another formidable environmental foe: polyester textile waste. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that each person in the United States discards more than 70 pounds of textiles annually. What’s worse, the report said, more than 85% of textile waste settles in landfills. “Eventually, we are going to run out of space,” Hinestroza says. “We’re going run out of countries where we can send our textile garbage. The consequences are quite sad, but the solution is possible and it is in ourselves.” Yelin Ko stands before the quiet hum of a laboratory fume hood in the Human Ecology Building and faces three magnetic stirrers. She loads a thimble full of colorful strips of polyester fabrics into a small round-bottom flask and then pours a sodium hydroxide solution to cover the textile. With agitation, a little applied heat, ethanol and cooling water, those tiny pieces of polyester cloth – made of polyethylene terephthalate, the kind of goop from which plastic soda bottles also are made – will become a laboratory soup. The scientists can then extract the old fabric’s monomers from the soup and use them to create linkers to be assembled into metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs. These MOF structures can be used to create coatings on clothing that protect people from germs or noxious gases, to shield firefighters from fire or other uses not yet imagined, says Ko, a doctoral student in the field of fiber science and a Fulbright Scholarship recipient who works in Hinestroza’s laboratory. “The chemistry is all governed by this idea of self-assembly, which is that the components themselves want to become an ordered structure,” Milner says. The scientists add copper salts to an acid to create a precursor solution, which they then bring to the soup of depolymerized polyester. “The natural process keeps going until it builds an extended structure – the MOFs – which is what comes out of the solution.” The team believes that the new techniques can disrupt the business-as-usual textile and apparel processes, which they say are unsustainable, says Suntivich, an electrochemist and material scientist. “Plastic recycling is a challenge obviously, so we’re going about it in this context. I’m seeing MOFs as just a way for me to enable the recycling of the material.” Textiles incorporating these MOFs can also clean up dyed and polluted waters, Hinestroza says. To make that happen, he’s bringing together the new chemistry techniques and his expertise in filtration and fiber science. In earlier research projects, Hinestroza had created naturally fibrous materials to selectively capture or decompose harsh contaminants like dyes from textile manufacturing, arsenic from fracking, mercury and cyanide from coal mining, and insecticides and fertilizers from agricultural production. also the waste and pollution that has been already generated, which will not suddenly vanish.”

Bumblebee research sparks rapid industry change By Krishna Ramanujan, Cornell Chronicle July 17, 2023 A Cornell study that revealed commercial eastern common bumblebee hives pose a threat to their wild counterparts has led one major pollination company to quickly adapt the bumblebee hive boxes they ship to growers. The study, which published in February in the Journal of Applied Ecology, showed that brightly colored commercial bumblebee nest boxes attract wild queens, who may be seeking to establish their own nests. When wild queens enter these nest boxes, workers treat them as invaders and kill them, which causes losses of wild hives – and valuable pollinators – in those areas. The study also found that attaching an existing device – called an excluder – to the nest box doorways, was 100% effective at preventing wild queens from entering hives. The company, Plant Products, a North American subsidiary of Biobest, has already provided excluders for the entrances and exits of all hives it ships, along with excluder operating instructions. In addition, a product manager has called every client to explain the use of the excluder, which makes a doorway too small for large queens, but big enough for workers. “For every queen that we’re losing because of this behavior, that’s a whole colony of bumblebees that we’re potentially losing that’s providing really important pollination services later in the season,” said Heather Grab, Ph.D. ’17, senior lecturer in the School of Integrative Plant Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the paper’s corresponding author. Olivia Miller ‘21, who worked on this research as part of her undergraduate thesis, is the paper’s first author. “From what we see in our data, it’s an average of about 10 queens per colony that are being killed, and that’s just in our study region,” she added. The study also found that pollination services actually declined at sites where commercial bumblebee colonies were used, compared to areas where they were not used. The scientists suspect that the drop in services was due to the loss of wild pollinators. The excluders were originally developed for a completely different purpose, but came in handy when the Cornell researchers made their discovery. Commercial bumblebee nest boxes come with two openings, which serve as an entrance and an exit for the bees. The openings can be slid shut, so if growers spray their crops, they can close the exit to keep bees in but leave the entrance open for bees out foraging to return. Also, if growers want to move a hive, they can close both openings and reopen them in a new location. Excluders were originally developed to cover just the exit, to prevent commercial hive queens from escaping and mating with wild bees and mixing genes, and/or spreading disease. No one expected they would be needed to keep wild bees out. Now Plant Products is using the excluders on both the entrances. Overall, bumblebees have been experiencing population declines throughout North America, so saving queens early in spring has a high potential to stem some of those declines, McArt added.

Cornell to lead concrete decarbonization project By Blaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle July 12, 2023 Concrete creates resilient floors, highway bridges and city sidewalks, but its usefulness comes at a cost: Concrete production causes more than 8% of carbon emissions, nearly four times as much as the aviation industry. Greeshma Gadikota, the Croll Sesquicentennial Fellow and an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering in Cornell Engineering, will lead an effort to decarbonize the concrete industry by harnessing carbon dioxide-capture and mineralization technologies to produce low-carbon construction materials. The $4 million project, part of President Joe Biden’s Clean Energy Plan, will be funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. “Extensive carbon dioxide emissions during the whole process makes concrete one of the most carbon intensive products,” said Gadikota, who will serve as the project’s principal investigator. She is a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. “This project requires us to lower the carbon intensity of concrete production by 60% or more. That’s a big challenge,” she said. “If we can implement new technology at every concrete-making site, we’ll draw down the global contribution of carbon dioxide from as high as 10% to 4%. That’s a major cut.” With the funding, Gadikota aims to build on integrated pathways for capturing carbon dioxide and converting it into solid products, for which her group is well known to produce construction materials bearing anthropogenic carbon dioxide. That work was initially funded by Cornell Atkinson via a 2023 Academic Venture Fund and a 2022 Fast Grant from the 2030 Project. Last year, the DOE released its Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap, which identified five domestic energy-intensive industries where decreasing carbon dioxide can have impact: cement and concrete, chemicals, food and beverage, iron and steel, and petroleum refining. Concrete manufacturing requires copious amounts of heat from sources like coal and petroleum coke – known as petcoke, which is derived from refining oil and generates more carbon dioxide than coal. This combustion accounts for about 88% of total energy consumption within the sector, according to the DOE. Joining Gadikota on the research project, “Accelerated Decarbonization of Cement via Integrated CO2 Capture and Mineralization to Produce High Strength Construction Materials,” will be co-principal investigator Sriramya Nair, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, and a faculty fellow at Cornell Atkinson. Her research focuses on the development and characterization of novel cementitious materials. The other co-principal investigators are Costas Tsouris, Radu Custelcean and Denise Antunes da Silva, of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The group will work with industry partners concrete supplier Argos USA, Alpharetta, Georgia; steel maker Nucor Corporation, Auburn, New York; and cement supplier Votorantim Cimentos North America. Gadikota said that the researchers will demonstrate the feasibility of the new technology at relevant industrial conditions with Argos USA, while leveraging the technical expertise of Votorantim Cimentos in sustainable construction materials and using EAF slags – electric arc furnace slag, which is a by-product generated during the steel-making process – supplied by Nucor. Said Gadikota: “The bench-scale and pilot-scale methods developed through this project will inform full-scale implementation and commercialization of this new technology to decarbonize the cement industry.”

Students, experts collaborate on global development solutions By Kelly Merchan Department of Global Development July 10, 2023 For the first time, a new research collaborative brought together undergraduates and experts from around the world to work on development issues from reducing plastic waste in Kyrgyzstan to empowering women farmers in Tanzania. The global development students get direct experience with real-world projects, while the experts, representing diverse fields from 12 countries across the Americas, Asia and Africa, gain research assistance from the students. The Humphrey PACT (Practitioner Assistant Collaborative Training) Program promotes research collaboration between undergraduates and Hubert H. Humphrey Fellows, midcareer professionals specialized in agriculture, rural development and natural resource management, who spend one year at Cornell for professional development. The Humphrey programs are housed in the Department of Global Development in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “Each year, the Humphrey Fellows bring a wealth of expertise to Cornell,” said Ed Mabaya, director of the fellowship and research professor in the Department of Global Development. “We are thrilled to draw on the fellows’ expertise and provide students with an opportunity to learn from practitioners who have direct experience leading local initiatives around the globe.” In its inaugural year, the PACT Program supported 12 research partnerships, ranging from agricultural development finance and climate finance in South Africa to science communication strategies for biofortified crops in Zimbabwe. The program is the first formalized opportunity for Humphrey Fellows to step into a leadership role at Cornell. “The PACT program has been a transformative experience thanks to my mentor, Diana Ulloa Jimenez, who has equipped me with the skills, knowledge and network necessary to excel in my work in Latin America and my vision to make a positive impact,” said Serena Moscarella ’25. Their research project focused on how youth and women can become more involved in water access and water management strategies on island states in Latin America. “Working with Serena inspired me to believe in the future that we can create together for women in Latin America,” said Ulloa Jimenez, a 2022-23 Humphrey Fellow from Ecuador and co-founder of Adaptation Latin America and governing board member of Red Agua Ecuador (Ecuador Water Network). “Serena reminds me how we all need to listen to the voice of the optimistic young leader that each of us has inside ourselves.” Several research pairs co-wrote op-ed articles that explore an issue and their approach: 1.	The role of the maritime industry in sustainable energy solutions: Dong-pyo Hong (South Korea) and Sadaqat Omar ’26 explored maritime energy policies and how decarbonization, liquefied natural gas, biofuel and other alternatives to fossil fuels can contribute to reduce carbon emissions. 2.	Bending the curve of tomato loss can help Nigerian farmers, reduce poverty: John Babadara(Nigeria), Sarah Langleben ’24 and Kristen Ikle ’24 focused on viable social enterprise models for Nigeria, startup funding and communication strategies. In the long term, this research seeks to identify, document and disseminate a sustainably scalable model to tackle rural poverty in developing countries like Nigeria. 3.	Addressing food loss and waste: A path to sustainable food systems: Nodira Kurbanbaeva(Uzbekistan) and Yiska Agoussi ’26 researched the causes and impacts of food loss and waste, with a focus on integrated approaches, data collection and landscape mapping in achieving sustainable food systems. 4.	Shifting focus to long-term drought resilience is paramount in East Africa: Lydia Ngonzi (Uganda) and Jessica Pedro-Pascual ’25 performed a comparative analysis exploring the effects of the mega drought on the Horn of Africa, which is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, and the Southwestern United States, where the mega drought is at its worst in 1,200 years.

Student veteran celebrates July Fourth as a new citizen By Caitlin Hayes, Cornell Chronicle June 29, 2023 As a teenager, Andy Shin ’23, M.P.A. ’25, spent Independence Day volunteering at the festivities in his hometown of Diamond Bar, California; already he associated the Fourth of July with service, community and the diversity he had come to love in the U.S. But Shin didn’t feel entirely a part of that community – because he wasn’t a U.S. citizen. “I really, really wanted to become an American,” Shin said. “I knew this is where I wanted to live. I saw so much potential here, and as corny as it sounds, I really love this country.” Shin’s mother had immigrated from South Korea with Shin, then 12, and his older brother in 2010; she wanted her sons to have access to higher quality education. Twelve years later – after graduating high school, enlisting in the U.S. Army, and nearly finishing his undergraduate studies at Cornell – Shin gained his citizenship last November. With citizenship, Shin can now plan his future in the states. “It gave me the most American thing: freedom,” Shin said. “Now I have the confidence to pursue any area I want to be immersed in.” Shin’s path was guided by a mentor in the small city of Diamond Bar, near Los Angeles: Jack Tanaka, a Japanese-American civic leader and retired Army master sergeant who advised the local Youth Lions Club. As a high school student, Shin completed hundreds of hours of community service through the club, and, inspired by Tanaka’s military service (as well as the service of many members of his family in Korea), he made plans to join the U.S. Army. Shin’s fluency in Korean made him eligible for a program, Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI), that recruited legal nonresidents with valuable skills; he signed the contract in 2015, even before graduating high school, with the intention of becoming an airborne medic. But just before Shin was to be deployed for basic training, the Department of Defense suspended the MAVNI program, and Shin’s initial training date (or ship-out date) was delayed, and delayed again. “After three or four months of waiting, my brain was getting fried, and I had to put it to work somewhere,” Shin said. He enrolled in community college and committed himself to academics while awaiting orders. Months stretched to years of waiting, but he continued to hone and develop his interest in environment and sustainability, equity-focused community-building, and efforts, at the intersection of the public and private sectors, to combat climate change. His work eventually led to his acceptance to Cornell in 2020. That same year, Shin obtained a green card and was finally eligible to complete basic training; he was shipped off to South Carolina with just enough time: hours after he graduated from training, he boarded a plane for Ithaca to begin classes. For the past three years, Shin has served in the Army Reserve, traveling to Vestal, New York one weekend a month and completing training over the summers while pursuing his major in environment and sustainability in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences. Despite the delays, Shin said his service in the military has reinforced his love of country, particularly its diversity. “Equal opportunity is something the Army really holds sacred,” Shin said. “I have not seen the Army tolerate any kind of discrimination. And when you’re going through the same thing - often challenging things - with a group of people, you care for one another despite race or place of origin. I really see a future in the U.S. because of that diversity and the respect for differences.”

Wildfire smoke downwind affects health, wealth and mortality: Smoke particulates from wildfires could lead to between 4,000 and 9,000 premature deaths and cost $36 to $82 billion per year in the United States, according to new research by Cornell, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST) and the University of Houston. The study, “Quantifying the Premature Mortality and Economic Loss From Wildfire-Induced PM2.5 in the Contiguous U.S.,” was published June 1 in Science of the Total Environment. “We think of automobile tailpipes and factory emissions polluting our air,” said Oliver Gao, the Howard Simpson Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, a senior author on the study. “We don’t necessarily think about air pollution from natural sources like wildfires. “Climate change is leading to weather extremes like more storms and hurricanes, but it can also lead to more wildfires,” Gao said. “The Quebec wildfires in early June affected human health hundreds of miles away in the distant cities New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington.” The study’s first author is Shuai Pan, a former Cornell postdoctoral researcher, now in the Emergency Management College at NUIST, China. Senior author is Yunsoo Choi, associate professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Houston. Wildfires release fine particulate matter – called PM2.5, which consists of inhalable organic compounds, aerosols and metals that are 2.5 microns or less – substantially smaller than a human hair, which can enter the lungs and bloodstream. “The smoke and particulate matter from wildfires can pose human health risks,” Pan said. “Epidemiological studies suggested that exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 was positively associated with mortality and some common respiratory diseases.” The researchers used satellite wildfire emission and air quality (PM2.5) data gathered from 2012 to 2014 for their current updated model and assessed how smoke from wildfires could impact human health and economies. Metropolitan regions located near fire sources, such as Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta, will likely see a large health burden and corresponding economic loss, according to the study. Los Angeles – downwind from fires in the western U.S. – may see 119 premature deaths annually, and $1.07 billion in financial burden, according to the new model. Downwind from southern U.S. fires, Atlanta could have 76 premature deaths annually with $690 million in economic fallout, while Houston, estimated to have 65 premature deaths attributable to fire-induced particulate matter, may see $580 million in economic fallout. In the model, the researchers estimated New York City metropolitan area – recently affected the Quebec wildfire in early June – would incur 86 premature deaths resulting from similar events, and see $780 million in associated economic costs. California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina likely would be the states with the highest number of premature deaths due to the volume of particulate matter distributed by the smoke. Law and regulations – such as planned events to thin forests – could reduce and mitigate the harmful effects of wildfires, Gao said. “Wildfire affects our health,” he said. “In this era of climate change, if we remove flammable vegetation and do things like create green fire breaks and reduce the fuel for the fires, we can substantially decrease the harm of smoke downwind in populated areas.” “In addition to law and regulations,” Pan said, “local policies and guidance are also important to reduce wildfire risk and to protect health from the adverse health effects of exposure.” Other institutions participating in the study were the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington; Pusan National University, Korea; Ambri, Inc., Marlborough, Massachusetts; and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health, part of the U.S.  Department of Transportation funded this research.

Political philosopher Richard Miller dies at 77 By David Nutt, Cornell Chronicle June 16, 2023 Richard William “Dick” Miller, the Wyn and William Y. Hutchinson Professor in Ethics and Public Life Emeritus in the College of Arts and Sciences, who brought deep moral insight to philosophical theory and matters of social and political justice, died June 9. He was 77. Miller was widely heralded for extending the traditional boundaries of philosophy to incorporate the social sciences – a far-reaching and inclusive approach that reflected his diverse interests and his dedication to wrestling with a range of urgent ethical issues, from poverty and capitalism to U.S. foreign policy and climate change. “Dick Miller was a remarkable scholar and teacher, a true polymath,” said Kieran Donaghy, professor emeritus of city and regional planning in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning. Richard Miller Miller, born Sept. 24, 1945, earned his bachelor’s degree from Amherst College in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1975. While his dissertation focused on solipsism and language in the writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein, he was not thinking solely about academic matters in those years – he was actively protesting the war in Vietnam, supporting the civil rights struggle and working to combat class and income inequality. “The antiwar movement was what made me interested in political philosophy,” Miller once said. “What to think about the nature of political power in the United States became very practically important. … My central hope for my work is that it will help people make the right political choices and discuss their political differences in morally insightful ways.” After beginning his teaching career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Miller joined Cornell’s Sage School of Philosophy in 1973, where, along with his colleagues the late Richard Newell Boyd and Nicholas Sturgeon, he helped to establish the university as a center of research in ethics. The breadth of Miller’s philosophical knowledge was evident in his teachings and publications, which spanned aesthetics, Marx, ethical theory, epistemology and general philosophy of science. One of Miller’s largest contributions to his discipline was helping to move the philosophy of science toward a new model of scientific methodology, one that isolated causal mechanisms to explain observations, whereas the prevailing model from the 1920s into the 1960s had been positivism, which subsumed specific observations under general laws, according to Derk Pereboom, the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Philosophy and Ethics (A&S). In this effort, Miller joined prominent figures such as his Harvard philosophy professor, Hilary Putnam, and MIT linguistics professor Noam Chomsky, with Miller extending this movement to the social sciences, Pereboom said. “Dick’s book, ‘Fact and Method’ not only disabused generations of students in fields other than philosophy – e.g., planning and the social sciences – of the fallacies of positivism, but also liberated them from the straitjacket of the ‘covering-law model,’ still pervasively taught in courses on research methods,” Donaghy said. “‘Fact and Method’ was also influential in giving rise to the ‘causal realism’ methodological movement in economics.” In the late 1980s, Miller’s focus shifted to issues of economic and political justice, often on a global scale. Undergraduate and graduate students who enrolled in his Ethics, Development and Globalization course were “challenged – for the better – by Dick’s cogent analyses of ethical dimensions of climate change and U.S. foreign policy,” Donaghy said. Nathaniel Jezzi, Ph.D. ’11 recalled Miller being quite funny, with a subtle, yet incisive, deadpan delivery, and his commitment to justice was “genuine and lived.” During the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Miller accepted an invitation to attend meetings of Jezzi’s antiwar student group. “Dick became a regular member. As a professor who had thought deeply about the ethics of war and written on the topic, he could have led the group,” he said. “But, instead, I was impressed by how he happily sat back in a concerned and supportive show of solidarity and let the students run the discussion.” Miller was an avid traveler, backpacking across Europe during summer breaks in college and later visiting Norway, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Nova Scotia with his family. He also traveled to Russia and China for guest lectures on the ethics of climate change and economic and political inequality.

Study unveils policy insights for reshoring EV battery production By Patrick Gillespie June 14, 2023 With the federal government incentivizing the expansion of domestic electric-vehicle battery manufacturing, a new Cornell study examines the long-term energy and sustainability prospects of U.S. production, and highlights policy approaches for building a more resilient battery supply chain. EV batteries are mostly manufactured overseas, and many policy makers want to move more production to the U.S. – a practice known as reshoring – to reduce dependence on foreign imports and unpredictable global supply chains. But reshoring will also have an effect on the country’s renewable energy transition and climate goals. A study published on June 14 in Science Advances provides one of the most comprehensive energy and environmental analyses of reshoring lithium-ion EV batteries, considering the whole life cycle, including raw material acquisition, component production, manufacturing, distribution and transportation. The study found that reshoring could reduce the overall carbon footprint of U.S. EV batteries and the energy needed to produce them, but the benefits can swing dramatically based on factors such as advances in technology, supply chain restructuring, and electric vehicle adoption. “For example, utilizing recycled aluminum and nickel can reduce the carbon footprint by up to 26% for the pre-pandemic U.S. electric vehicle fleet,” said the study’s co-lead author, Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael Zak Professor of Energy Systems Engineering and a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. “This study highlights the importance of data science and sustainability analytics in informing future policy on energy, climate, manufacturing and the environment.” The study also examined energy and sustainability prospects of an ally-shoring strategy, in which production capacities for refined metals and battery components are reallocated to Japan, South Korean and European Union countries. Findings from the study include: 1.	Increasing the shares of onshoring and ally production in the future U.S. EV battery supply chain could reduce the carbon footprint by up to 27% compared to the current supply chain configuration. 2.	Increasing the shares of renewable energy in the power grid and reducing the reliance on hard coal and lignite-fired electricity would enhance the environmental sustainability of EV batteries. 3.	A strategic integration of battery technology advancement and supply chain restructuring can result in a 54% improvement in climate change mitigation benefits. 4.	While reshoring could reduce ecotoxicity and fine particulate matter formation by over 30% from secondary nickel supply, there is a decrease in environmental performances in ozone formation, ozone depletion and ionizing radiation due to increasing overseas transportation distance for materials.

Metaverse could put a dent in global warming: For many technology enthusiasts, the metaverse – a virtual 3D environment in which the physical and digital worlds converge – has the potential to transform almost every facet of human life, from work to education to entertainment. New Cornell research shows the metaverse could have environmental benefits, too: lowering the global surface temperature by up to 0.02 degrees Celsius before the end of the century. The team’s paper, “Growing Metaverse Sector Can Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 10 Gt CO2e in the United States by 2050,” published June 14 in Energy and Environmental Science. The lead author is doctoral student Ning Zhao. “We try to understand, from the energy and climate perspectives, how this particular technology will be helpful,” said Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering in Cornell Engineering and the paper’s senior author. “We’re basically trying to predict the future, so we have to use a very rigorous systems analytics approach to understand all the statistical significance, all the possible pathways, and decipher all the data and information that is out there to find out the impacts in energy, in climate, in environment and also in economics and technology.” The team used AI-based modeling to analyze data from key sectors – technology, energy, environment and business – to anticipate the growth of metaverse usage and the impact of its most promising applications: remote work, virtual traveling, distance learning, gaming and non-fungible tokens. The researchers projected metaverse expansion through 2050 along three different trajectories – slow, nominal and fast – and they looked to previous technologies, such as television, the internet and the iPhone, for insight into how quickly that adoption might occur. They also factored in the amount of energy that increasing usage would consume. The modeling suggested that within 30 years, the technology would be adopted by more than 90% of the population. “One thing that did surprise us is that this metaverse is going to grow much quicker than what we expected,” You said. “Look at earlier technologies – TV, for instance. It took decades to be eventually adopted by everyone. Now we are really in an age of technology explosion. Think of our smartphones. They grew very fast.” Currently, two of the biggest industry drivers of metaverse development are Meta (formerly Facebook, which believed in the technology so much it rebranded itself) and Microsoft, both of which contributed to the study. Meta has been focusing on individual experiences, such as gaming, while Microsoft specializes in business solutions, including remote conferencing and distance learning. Limiting business travel would generate the largest environmental benefit, according to You. “Think about the decarbonization of our transportation sector,” he said. “Electric vehicles work, but you can’t drive a car to London or Tokyo. Do I really have to fly to Singapore for a conference tomorrow? That will be an interesting decision-making point for some stakeholders to consider as we move forward with these technologies with human–machine interface in a 3D virtual world.” The paper notes that by 2050 the metaverse industry could potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions by 10 gigatons; lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by 4.0 parts per million; decrease effective radiative forcing by 0.035 watts per square meter; and lower total domestic energy consumption by 92 EJ, a reduction that surpasses the annual nationwide energy consumption of all end-use sectors in previous years. “This mechanism is going to help, but in the end, it is going to help lower the global surface temperature by up to 0.02 degrees,” he said. “There are so many sectors in this economy. You cannot count on the metaverse to do everything. But it could do a little bit if we leverage it in a reasonable way.” The research was supported by the National Science Foundation.

John Kingsbury, Shoals Marine Laboratory founder, dies at 94 By Blaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle June 12, 2023 John Kingsbury, professor emeritus of botany, who built a small island in the Gulf of Maine into an immersive, summerlong living classroom for students eager to learn about the land and the sea, died May 27 in Norwich, Vermont. He was 94. Kingsbury’s vision for Appledore Island, Maine, allowed undergraduate students studying marine science to become hands-on researchers at the Shoals Marine Laboratory – a seasonal field-station collaboration between Cornell and the University of New Hampshire. On campus, Kingsbury taught courses on algae in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and wrote the textbook, “Poisonous Plants of the United States and Canada,” specifically to train doctors and veterinarians. He spent eight years gathering material for it, crossing North America twice. Kingsbury acquired and oversaw a poisonous plant garden once adjoining the College of Veterinary Medicine and taught the veterinary students about those plants. The garden is now located at the Cornell Weed Science Teaching Garden adjacent to the Walter C. Muenscher building, named for the noted botanist, a mentor. Kingsbury’s book “Deadly Harvest,” completed in 1965 and illustrated by noted artist/illustrator Elfriede Abbe, with drawings by his wife, Louise Kingsbury ’57, discusses the history of plant poisoning in humans and animals. It is replete with factual data, as well as stories of medieval methods of deliberate poisoning and accidents. Kingsbury’s other books include “Seaweeds of Cape Cod and the Islands,” “200 Conspicuous, Unusual, or Economically Important Tropical Plants of the Caribbean,” and “The Rocky Shore,” an illustrated account the rock-strewn coast of New England. John Merriam “Jack” Kingsbury was born on July 4, 1928 in Boston to Willis and Constance Kingsbury. He earned his bachelor’s degree in 1950 from the University of Massachusetts, and his master’s (1952) and doctorate (1954) from Harvard University. Kingsbury served as an instructor at Brandeis University from 1953-54, then joined the Cornell faculty in 1954 as an assistant professor. At Cornell, he served as an associate professor, a professor and became emeritus in 1983. He conceived of a living laboratory on Appledore Island in the 1960s, navigating fundraising, a gauntlet of approvals at Cornell and the local building laws. The trustees approved the project in July 1968. The isle facility formally opened in 1973 and was dedicated in 1975. The summer program was originally designed to acquaint students with marine sciences ranging from invertebrate zoology to the economics of coastal zone management. The program accentuated fieldwork, natural habitats and ecological interconnections. It also served good food. Kingsbury brought along a chef – whom he’d hired from the Ithaca Yacht Club – to feed the hard-working undergraduates. Their menu included fresh mussels and chanterelle mushrooms gratineed with cream, lobster with juniper berries, and chocolate mousse baked Alaska. The New Englanders – along with Kingsbury – rapidly banded together to oppose and thwart the proposed refinery. Worried that it would ruin the pristine natural area, the professor told the New York Times in January 1974 that an oil dock “will, quite simply, put us out of business.” Later that spring, the Durham town board handily voted down the proposal. Kingsbury also reconstructed the 19th century poet Celia Thaxter’s serene garden on Appledore Island. To this day, the Shoals Marine Laboratory allows island visitors to take a day trip to tour it. In addition to his academic work, he served as director of Cornell Botanic Gardens in 1981-82. He was a U.S. Fulbright Senior Scholar in Australia, a National Science Foundation faculty fellow and a fellow at the American Academy of Veterinary and Comparative Toxicology. Kingsbury is survived by his wife, Louise; his daughter Joanna Merriam Kingsbury Smith ’83 and her husband David Smith; and granddaughters Celia Smith Luterbacher ‘09, M.P.A. ’11 and her husband Jeremy Lutenbacher, Ph.D. ‘12 ; and Molly Smith Dunn ’12 and her husband Stephen Dunn; and great-grandson Ezra Luterbacher.

Cornellian UN climate authors warn of ‘extreme’ risk to people, food systems By Krisy Gashler June 8, 2023 When Tropical Cyclone Freddy battered East Africa this spring, it became the longest-lasting, most powerful cyclone ever recorded worldwide. It killed almost 1,500 people, 1,216 of them in Malawi. For decades, scientists have warned that the increased frequency and intensity of storms and other natural disasters are directly linked to climate change. “Places like Malawi are highly vulnerable to climate impacts but bear virtually no responsibility in terms of greenhouse gas emissions,” said Rachel Bezner Kerr, a Cornell Atkinson faculty fellow, professor in the Department of Global Development in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), and one of the coordinating lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Working Group II report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. For Bezner Kerr, Tropical Cyclone Freddy was not just another data point: She has conducted collaborative research in Malawi for over 20 years, seeking to improve small-scale farm families’ food security, nutrition, income and sustainable land use. Two of her friends were killed in flooding in Malawi this spring. “I hope that the severity of the message coming out of the assessment of the scientific literature is an alarm bell for policymakers to understand how much responsibility they have and how crucial it is that they take action,” she said. Bezner Kerr is one of several Cornellians who are playing critical roles in establishing the scientific basis upon which global citizens and leaders can understand the causes, effects and solutions to climate change. This week, world leaders are meeting in Bonn, Germany, for the United Nations’ Bonn Climate Change Conference; The annual spring conference convenes those leaders, along with environmental organizations, businesses, scientists and others, to continue negotiations in preparation for the larger Conference of the Parties (COP) gatherings each fall. This year, world leaders are completing the first-ever Global Stocktake: A key element of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Stocktake compels countries to share data on how, or if, they have implemented the promises they made when signing the 2015 Paris Agreement. UN-university partnerships build adaptation capacity Allison Chatrchyan, senior research associate in CALS’ Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and adjunct professor of international environmental law at the Cornell Law School, is participating as a party negotiator at the Bonn conference this week. She is also co-presenting at a United Nations side event on the U.N. Climate Change and Universities Partnership Program (UN-UPP), along with Deborah Aller, extension associate in CALS’ School of Integrative Plant Science, and three students who have worked on partnership projects: Anna Connor, MRP ’23, Chloe Long, MRP ’25, and Maria Anaya Torres, Cornell Law School, JSD ’25. The moderated discussion on the power of the UN-UPP to build capacity for climate adaptation globally will be broadcast live June 10 at 10:45 a.m. EDT. Chatrchyan has been bringing Cornell students to COP meetings as part of her Global Climate Change Science and Policy course since 2017. “In my courses, we focus on the concept of polycentric climate governance: the idea that meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement  is not only the mandate of nation states, but is very importantly driven by nongovernmental organizations and civil society,” Chatrchyan said. “It gives me hope to see the level of skill and fervor that these students bring to their engagement with international partners, and their commitment to combating climate change.”

Pond emission measurements improve climate predictions By Krishna Ramanujan, Cornell Chronicle June 5, 2023 There could be billions of shallow lakes and ponds on Earth, though lack of mapping systems makes it hard to know just how many exist. Together, they emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but emissions from these systems vary considerably and are not well understood. Now, a new study measures methane and carbon dioxide emissions from 30 small lakes and ponds (one acre or less) in temperate areas of Europe and North America, revealing that the smallest and shallowest bodies of water exhibit the greatest variability over time. The paper marks an important step toward calibrating climate models so they better predict emissions from inland waterbodies and it points to the need to study small waterbodies more closely. “This study helps understand both the drivers of greenhouse gas concentrations, and importantly, what makes some ponds more variable in their concentrations,” said Meredith Holgerson, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and senior author of the study. Holgerson and colleagues have previously estimated that shallow lakes and ponds may contribute 5% of the global methane emissions to the atmosphere. But without accurate measurements across many water bodies, they said, the true number could be as little as half or as much as twice that percentage. While some small lakes and ponds emit greenhouse gasses in consistent, predictable amounts, others are highly variable. Some ponds emit large amounts, and others emit very little. Understanding these dynamics is important as carbon dioxide and methane act as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with methane being 25 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. To begin, Holgerson and collaborators at the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network designed the study and then reached out farther afield within the network. Sampling supplies were mailed to 16 study co-authors scattered across Europe and North America, who then collected gas samples from a total of 30 small and shallow ponds and lakes, which were  analyzed. Each body of water was sampled over the 2018 and 2019 summers at three times in three locations, including the deepest point and then two locations on opposite ends (but not too close to the shore). “One key result we found was that the smaller the system is, in regards to surface area, the higher emissions are likely to be,” Ray said. For carbon dioxide, samples were consistent in all parts of the waterbody, which revealed that researchers likely only needed to collect a sample from one location to get an accurate prediction of the whole body of water. Methane, on the other hand, required samples from multiple locations to get an accurate measure. Also, for methane, shallower systems were more variable, suggesting stratification of the water column in deeper water may prevent gases from rising to the surface. Similarly, in terms of timing, a single sample in the summer provided a reasonably accurate carbon dioxide reading for the entire summer, but an accurate average emission rate of methane required multiple samplings over the course of the summer. For carbon dioxide, the amount of plant life in the water played a large role in variability over time. For methane, variability was more driven by the water depth and likely associated with stratification in the water column. Among other uses, the study sets the groundwork for informing a New York state climate mitigation strategy to build more ponds to help farmers better handle droughts. “We’re working to identify how ponds can be built, or if there are simple management strategies people can employ, to minimize emissions,” Ray said.

Preventing the next pandemic with nature-based solutions: webinar June 26 June 1, 2023 Raina Plowright, a Cornell Atkinson Scholar and the Rudolf J. and Katharine L. Steffen Professor of Veterinary Medicine in the Department of Public and Ecosystem Health. Zoonotic spillover — when diseases pass between animals and humans — is a major cause of disease and the primary cause of recent pandemics, including COVID-19. Scientists and practitioners from four continents will gather for a webinar that explores how strategic protection and restoration of natural habitats could disrupt pathways to zoonotic spillover, while also addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. The webinar, “How to Prevent the Next Pandemic: Nature-Based Solutions and Policy Opportunities,” will be Monday, June 26 at 11 a.m., and hosted by Raina Plowright, a Cornell Atkinson Scholar and the Rudolf J. and Katharine L. Steffen Professor of Veterinary Medicine in the Department of Public and Ecosystem Health. It will be moderated by award-winning science writer David Quammen, with an opening statement by Maria Van Kerkhove ’99, head of the Emerging Diseases and Zoonoses Unit for the World Health Organization (WHO) and technical lead for WHO’s COVID-19 response. “Almost every scenario of zoonotic spillover involves some kind of land-use change, but if you look at the pandemic treaties being negotiated right now, they do not include preventative solutions,” Plowright said. “Current pandemic treaties are focused on what happens once we have a pathogen running rampant within the human population, but there’s little investment in that upstream process: identifying critical pinch points in nature and how to intervene so we can prevent spillover from happening in the first place.” Plowright advocates for carefully constructed ecological countermeasures: actions that protect and restore wildlife habitat or mitigate wildlife-human interactions. Such countermeasures act as a “critical first line of defense” against pandemics, while providing many co-benefits, including reducing the impacts of climate change and enhancing biodiversity, she said. Panelists are 10 global and cross-disciplinary experts, who will examine the fundamental drivers of pandemics, the strategies we can take to prevent them, and the current policy opportunities for primary pandemic prevention. Topics to be discussed include: 1.	How human activity and environmental change increase the risk of virus spillover from animals to humans 2.	How we can stop spillover events by addressing the fundamental drivers of spillover through ecological countermeasures 3.	How key strategic ecological countermeasures (beyond the current general guidance “prevent deforestation”) can be deployed 4.	How pandemic solutions intersect climate change and biodiversity loss solutions 5.	Effective and clear recommendations for policymakers to integrate pandemic prevention alongside global preparedness efforts The webinar is hosted by eCornell and supported by the College of Veterinary Medicine’s Department of Public and Ecosystem Health, the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response, and Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.

Spring freeze: Cornell helps vintners recover growing season By Blaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle May 31, 2023 In the aftermath of a prolonged mid-May freeze, two Cornell viticulture experts are helping to advise grape growers in New York on how to rescue their season. Currently, the vineyards now face a possible reduced crop and economic loss. Burgeoning grapevine shoots were destroyed after a prolonged freeze May 17-18, as shown here about a week later. In addition to the large meeting, Walter-Peterson, who is also a Cornell doctoral student in horticulture, toured three freeze-damaged Finger Lakes vineyards on May 26 with Richard A. Ball, commissioner of the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Ball was able to see the damage, so that he could advise the governor, state legislators and agricultural groups. The devastating cold snap occurred May 17-18, when temperatures dropped below freezing from about midnight to dawn in the central Finger Lakes and Hudson Valley wine regions, according to weather data from Cornell’s Northeast Regional Climate Center. In his assessment of the Finger Lakes, Walter-Peterson said that the Keuka Lake area vineyards were the hardest hit, with steady damage at about 50% of vineyard acreage affected, while Seneca and Cayuga lake vineyards varied in their damage. From Lake Ontario, which offers a heat buffer, the damage appeared to be heavier going south toward the Finger Lakes, Walter-Peterson said. Experts are also evaluating damage to other crops from the frost, including apples, blueberries, raspberries and cherries. In the meeting, Walter-Peterson and officials from the Farm Services Agency, a part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said efforts are underway to obtain a federal-disaster designation – but it may be from several months to more than a year away – due to economic fact finding and data collection. The growers were reminded to document the extent of damage, photograph and map the damaged fields, in case they needed to file crop insurance claims or if the state or federal governments declared a disaster. Grapevine shoots – which contain leaves, curlicue tendrils and tiny fruit – emerge from buds as the spring days warm, said Jason Londo, associate professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science Horticulture at Cornell AgriTech in Geneva. He conducts research on fruit crop stress physiology and adaptation, and grapevine cold hardiness. “What helps the shoots to grow is swelling, as the water within the cells stretch things out,” Londo said. The current damage appears to be in the early cultivars, he said, as the shoots were further along in development. “When you have that much water in a cell in a cold snap, it’s very hard to keep it from freezing.” While the last major spring freeze occurred in New York’s Lake Erie grape region in 2012, according to Londo, protecting vineyards from frost remains an active area of research. “It’s challenging,” Londo said. “There are not a lot of ways to get plants to resist freezing once they have water in those big cells. Frost timing and plant development are both dynamic each year and they don’t always sync up. It’s hard to develop mitigation techniques that work for every freeze.”

Cornell Atkinson awards $1.6M in seed grants: When a devastating heat wave hit the Pacific Ocean between 2013 and 2016, biologists documented sharp declines in many marine creatures, including the iconic humpback whale: Whale abundance near southeastern Alaska during and after the heat wave dropped by 56% and still hasn’t recovered to 2013 levels. A team of Cornell researchers and external partners now seeks to understand how humpback whale songs – a critical component of the species’ mating behavior – were affected by the heat wave, and to engage the public on the threats of climate change. Such marine heat waves are expected to worsen in frequency and intensity as the planet warms. The project is one of 11 that will be supported by the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability’s Academic Venture Fund (AVF). Cornell Atkinson will provide $1.6 million in seed funding to support research teams across nine colleges and 22 departments, many with external partnerships. Awarded annually since 2008, AVF grants encourage interdisciplinary research that promotes environmental sustainability. The humpback whale study is co-led by Annie Lewandowski, senior lecturer in the Department of Music in the College of Arts and Sciences; and Katy Payne ’59, renowned bioacoustics researcher in the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics. The pair have been collaborating since 2017. This project will bring together artists and scientists from two nonprofits – the Hawaii Marine Mammal Consortium and the Sound Science Research Collective – and the federal Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. The researchers will document and analyze whether the marine heat wave and subsequent population decline impacted the structure of humpback whale songs in both breeding grounds in Hawaii and foraging grounds in Alaska. The group will then develop diverse popular media and scientific publications on their findings. “Public engagement is essential to helping slow these ocean-scale changes, which affect human survival as much as they do whales,” Lewandowski said. “If the team’s work can help the public regain a sense of appreciation for these beautiful, mysterious whale songs and react to the plight of whales in today’s oceans, there is a chance that the whales may save us from the disastrous course we are on,” Payne said. Descriptions of each of this year’s AVF winners are available on the Cornell Atkinson website. Each year, multiple faculty review panels consider and select winning proposals most likely to spur original, interdisciplinary research. Panels prioritize projects with potential to connect research beyond campus, including external funding and partnerships. “Cornell Atkinson’s mission is to drive research into action to protect people and the planet. To do that, we need to foster relationships across the academy and with government agencies, corporations and nongovernmental organizations,” said David Lodge, the Francis J. DiSalvo Director of Cornell Atkinson. “Each year, the Academic Venture Fund expands and connects a vibrant research community and expands the reach of Cornell’s leadership in sustainability.”

Unlikely coincidence blooms as classic weed guide gets updated: The wild parsnip is finally getting its due. When “Weeds of the Northeast,” a comprehensive identification guide authored by a trio of Cornell researchers, was first published by Cornell University Press in 1997 it quickly became a classic of the field – and for the field – helping legions of botanists, home gardeners, green thumbs, landscape managers, pest control specialists and allergists spot invasive plant life across the region. Ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), also known as creeping Charlie, is a perennial weed in the Lamiaceae family commonly found in turfgrass. It is one of the more than 500 species featured in “Weeds of the Northeast.” Over the last 25 years, the book sold nearly 100,000 copies, making it one of the press’s top sellers. But times change, and so does the flora. In March, CUP published a second edition of “Weeds of the Northeast” that adds more than 200 new species – such as waterhemp, Japanese stiltgrass and garlic mustard – that have been slowly encroaching into the Northeast, as well as various weeds that, for one reason or another, were omitted from the first guide (apologies to the wild parsnip). The book also updates terminology and expands its footprint to include more species from the mid-Atlantic states and upper Midwest. The creation of the new edition hinges upon an extraordinary coincidence. You could call it a tale of two DiTommasos. Or, more accurately, a DiTommaso and a DiTomaso. The original “Weeds of the Northeast” took root as the master’s thesis of Richard Uva, MPS  ’94, Ph.D. ’03, who developed the manuscript with a pair of faculty members in the Department of Horticulture and the Department of Crop, Soil and Atmospheric Sciences (now the School of Integrative Plant Science Horticulture Section and Soil and Crop Sciences Section) in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences: associate professor Joseph Neal and weed science professor Joseph DiTomaso. He and the team reached out to a network of researchers throughout the Northeast for suggestions of weeds to include, as well as color images of their flowers, fruits, collars, sheaths, seeds, stems and the like. For years, the team wrestled with including as much information as possible while also keeping the book a reasonable – and portable – size, for ease of use in the field. There were a lot of difficult choices to make, DiTommaso said, but very few disagreements among the team. (After all, at the end of the day, “you’re fighting over weeds,” he said.) DiTommaso, for one, was thrilled to include wild parsnip. He’d always been surprised that, as a common weed, it hadn’t garnered a single mention in the first edition. He wasn’t the only person who noticed. Other additions include palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), i.e., pigweed, a most troublesome, summer annual weed often resistant to herbicide, and lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria), a fast-spreading perennial weed of turfgrass and wet areas with showy yellow flowers, which is visible for only a few weeks at the start of spring each year. And of course, the book contains familiar culprits such as swallowwort, kudzu and common ragweed. While these weeds are clear-cut nuisances for gardeners, DiTommaso hopes “Weeds of the Northeast” also helps cultivate an appreciation for them, too. DiTommaso uses both books in his fall semester Weed Biology and Management course, which is fitting, given that “Weeds of the Northeast” was his go-to text when he was an undergraduate and graduate student in Canada. “Now everybody I see here, it’s like, oh, yeah, this is my book,” he said. “I’ve signed so many copies. Now I know what it feels like to be like a star.”

Microbes key to sequestering carbon in soil May 24, 2023 Microbes are by far the most important factor in determining how much carbon is stored in the soil, according to a new study with implications for mitigating climate change and improving soil health for agriculture and food production. The research is the first to measure the relative importance of microbial processes in the soil carbon cycle. The study’s authors found that the role microbes play in storing carbon in the soil is at least four times more important than any other process, including decomposition of biomatter. That’s important information: Earth’s soils hold three times more carbon than the atmosphere, creating a vital carbon sink in the fight against climate change. The study, “Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency Promotes Global Soil Carbon Storage,” published May 24 in Nature, describes a novel approach to better understanding soil carbon dynamics by combining a microbial computer model with data assimilation and machine learning, to analyze big data related to the carbon cycle. The method measured microbial carbon use efficiency, which tells how much carbon was used by microbes for growth versus how much was used for metabolism. When used for growth, carbon becomes sequestered by microbes in cells and ultimately in the soil, and when used for metabolism, carbon is released as a side product in the air as carbon dioxide, where it acts as a greenhouse gas. Ultimately, growth of microbes is more important than metabolism in determining how much carbon is stored in the soil. “This work reveals that microbial carbon use efficiency is more important than any other factor in determining soil carbon storage,” said Yiqi Luo, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the paper’s senior author. The new insights point agricultural researchers toward studying farm management practices that may influence microbial carbon use efficiency to improve soil health, which also helps ensure greater food security. Future studies may investigate steps to increase overall soil carbon sequestration by microbes. Researchers may also study how different types of microbes and substrates (such as those high in sugars) may influence soil carbon storage. Soil carbon dynamics have been studied for the last two centuries, but those studies were mainly concerned with how much carbon gets into the soil from leaf litter and roots, and how much is lost to the air in the form of CO2 when organic matter decomposes. “But we are the first group that can evaluate the relative importance of microbial processes versus other processes,” Luo said. In an example of cutting-edge digital agriculture, Luo and colleagues made a breakthrough and developed a method to integrate big data into an earth system computer model by using data assimilation and machine learning. The model revealed that overall carbon use efficiency of microbe colonies was at least four times as important as any of the other components that were evaluated, including decomposition and carbon inputs. The new process-based model, machine learning approach, which made this result possible for the first time, opens the possibility for applying the method to analyze other types of big data sets. Feng Tao, a researcher at Tsinghua University, Beijing, is the paper’s first author. Xiaomeng Huang, a professor at Tsinghua University, is a corresponding author, along with Luo. Benjamin Houlton, the Ronald P. Lynch Dean of CALS and professor in the departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and of Global Development; and Johannes Lehmann, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor in the Soil and Crop Sciences Section of the School of Integrative Plant Science in CALS, are both co-authors. The study was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, among others.

Cornell Botanic Gardens has acquired 81 acres adjacent to the Fischer Old-growth Forest natural area in Newfield, New York, to further protect some of the county’s most mature trees – some of them 300 years old. The addition, finalized in March and made possible through a partnership between the university and the donor of the parcel, Shamrock Communities, LLC – as well as Finger Lakes Land Trust (FLLT) and Tompkins County – is an unusual arrangement for Cornell. Beavers and the damage they cause to trees, shown here, is part of the ecosystem at the Fischer Old-growth Forest natural area. The Botanic Gardens secured grant money from the county’s Natural Infrastructure Capital Program to cover closing costs and initial property maintenance. To be eligible for the grant, the land needed to be permanently protected. This protection will be provided through a conservation easement with FLLT, which will protect the land in perpetuity from future development. “The thing that really identifies an old-growth forest is the large dead trees that have fallen. If they had been logged, they wouldn't be there to die and fall,” Bittner said. The natural area now totals 181 acres. Bittner said that although the conservation easement is still pending, a trail has already been expanded and rerouted through the addition and is open to the public. The original 31.2-acre forest was acquired by the university in 1997 after decades of negotiations with the Cotton-Hanlon Lumber Company of Alpine, New York, saving the ancient trees from being felled. “The trees were inventoried, they were marked for harvest,” Bittner said of the forest’s original fate. “And Cornell faculty became aware of that, and the university lobbied Cotton-Hanlon to find some mutual arrangement that would protect the forest and meet Cotton-Hanlon’s needs, and ultimately landed on a land trade for another Cornell forest that was less sensitive.” In 1998 the forest was named to honor Richard B. Fischer, a beloved Cornell professor of environmental education, for his delight in natural history and his passion for environmental protection, which he passed on to his many students. Fischer died in 2005. Cornell purchased an adjoining 10 acres in 2000 to create a buffer around the forest. David Bandler, emeritus professor of food science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), and his wife Lenore donated 17.6 acres in 2015 and another 41.8 acres in 2017. To a trained eye, a walk through this preserve can be like going back in time. The beginning of the trail sits in a meadow near the remnants of an old barn foundation, hinting at the site's prior land use history. Further onto the property is an area of shrubs, abandoned from agricultural production 30 to 40 years ago. A young forest is just beyond, abandoned from agricultural use 50 to 70 years ago. The path eventually runs into a mature forest that had previously been timbered and concludes with the old-growth forest, home to 300-year-old trees. “We’re already experiencing increases in precipitation, both average and extreme events,” Bittner said. “Protecting existing wetlands and managing them to maintain their integrity is important not just for the ecological and academic benefits they provide, but also for flood protection. By ensuring that this 25-acre wetland will be managed as a protected natural area, it will continue to provide flood protection for everyone downstream.”

Researchers are more likely to pen scientific papers with co-authors of the same gender, a pattern that cannot be simply explained by the varying gender representation across scientific disciplines and time, according to joint research from Cornell and the University of Washington. Mining a digital corpus of 560,000 published research articles over a 50-year period, the research team observed consistent gender homophily – the tendency of authors to collaborate with others who share their gender. While this observation by itself is not new, the researchers went further, using novel methods to rule out seemingly logical explanations – like a field’s gender balance, say, or a field’s authorship norms for writing research papers. The team’s findings suggest a behavioral component is in play when scientists seek out collaborators. “One might posit that the gender homophily observed when considering a broad scientific landscape may be due to varying levels of gender representation,” said Y. Samuel Wang, assistant professor of statistics and data science and author of “Gender-Based Homophily in Collaborations Across a Heterogeneous Scholarly Landscape,” which was published in PLOS One in April. “However, our findings suggest that something beyond that is going on.” Comprising scholars in statistics, information science, biology and philosophy, the team mined a massive corpus of articles published between 1960 and 2011 from the online repository JSTOR. To help link genders to more than 800,000 author names, the team relied on social security records and crowdsourced data. Because of the limitations in the data set, this research was limited to men and women authors and didn’t factor in nonbinary identities, researchers said. From there, the team grouped authors from the same fields and eras, creating 50,000 hypothetical reconfigurations of authors. “We re-simulated hypothetical datasets. Our thinking was: How different is what we actually observed versus these hypothetical scenarios that we constructed?” said Wang, also an assistant professor of social statistics in the ILR School. “Very different, it turns out. This suggests that some other source of homophily is occurring in the data we observed.” As to why researchers tend to collaborate with those of the same gender, Wang and his team can’t say definitively. Data science methods can’t measure intent – why collaborators choose who they choose, but the team’s findings suggest that consideration of gender may be a factor, Wang said. Wang’s University of Washington co-authors are: Carole J. Lee, associate professor of philosophy; Jevin D. West, associate professor in the Information School; Carl T. Bergstrom, professor of biology, and Elena A. Erosheva, professor of statistics and social work. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the University of Washington’s Royalty Research Fund.

Gregory F. Sonnenberg, The Henry R. Erle, M.D.-Roberts Family Associate Professor of Medicine and head of basic research in Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Weill Cornell Medicine, has been awarded a five-year, $3.26 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, to investigate the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The new grant, under the Method for Extending Research In Time (MERIT) program, will fund research on a novel pathway that protects the intestine from damage and inflammation driven by an immune-derived factor called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). “It’s a huge honor to be considered and nominated for a NIH MERIT award, and such a privilege to be able to move this research forward with my laboratory over an extended period of time,” Sonnenberg said. The MERIT program gives investigators with stellar records of research accomplishment a five-year award with the possibility of extending the initial award for up to five additional years without the need to undergo another competitive peer review. Sonnenberg’s proposal was based on research his laboratory pioneered over the past decade characterizing key immune cell pathways in the intestine. It’s one of the major mysteries in the field. “TNF is normally beneficial, but what causes this shift for it to become a major mediator of chronic inflammatory diseases?” said Sonnenberg, who is in the Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology in the Weill Department of Medicine and a member of the Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Weill Cornell Medicine. Many current therapies block TNF to reduce inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, but those treatments are only effective in a subset of patients. And even if successful, this therapy can lose efficacy over time. Sonnenberg’s team discovered that TNF-induced gut inflammation correlates with the depletion of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a special class of cells abundant in the healthy intestine. “This provoked a hypothesis that these cells are keeping the TNF molecule in check and stopping it from driving tissue inflammation,” Sonnenberg said. Experiments published last year in preclinical models confirmed that hypothesis and revealed that ILC3s are essential to protect the intestine from TNF-mediated damage and inflammation, which the team will explore further with support of this MERIT Award. Sonnenberg and his laboratory proposed a series of experiments to define the cellular and molecular signals by which ILC3s protect from TNF-induced inflammation. He also plans to investigate this pathway in both mouse models and patient-based organoids, which are complex human cell culture systems that model the guts of healthy individuals or patients with IBD. Researchers cannot apply for MERIT grants directly; Sonnenberg and his laboratory originally applied for a standard “R01” grant from the NIH, which received a fundable score after peer-review and was subsequently nominated by NIH program staff for the MERIT award instead. Each year, NIAID issues about 15 new MERIT awards. The new award, which can double the length and amount of the grant, will take the investigation further, laying the groundwork for a much deeper understanding of IBD and paving the way for new therapeutic strategies.

Study to compare heart procedure benefits in underrepresented groups July 28, 2023 A multi-institutional team of scientists led by Dr. Mario Gaudino, the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Professor in Cardiothoracic Surgery and assistant dean for clinical trials at Weill Cornell Medicine, has been approved for a nearly $30 million funding award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The award will fund the first study among women, Black and Hispanic patients comparing the effectiveness of two revascularization options used to treat coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease, a narrowing or blockage of coronary arteries due to plaque buildup, is the leading cause of death in the United States. More than 1 million Americans undergo a procedure to restore normal blood flow to the heart annually. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive procedure that passes stents into the coronary artery, using catheters inserted into a small incision in the groin or wrist. It requires minimal anesthesia and patients typically go home the same day. By contrast, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is more invasive, requiring opening the chest with or without using a heart-lung bypass machine while under general anesthesia. The surgeon creates grafts using arteries or veins taken from the chest, arms or legs to bypass blocked coronary arteries. CABG involves a longer hospital stay and recovery time and has higher rates of complications during surgery than PCI. Still, it has longer-lasting benefits, including less risk of heart attack and the need for repeat intervention. More than half of patients facing a decision on PCI or CABG are women or racial groups that have been underrepresented in past clinical trials. “Clinical practice guidelines recommend choosing between PCI or CABG based on evidence,” said Gaudino, who is also a cardiothoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “However, prior studies have enrolled mostly non-Hispanic white men, leaving other patients with little guidance for making an informed decision.” The RECHARGE (REvascularization CHoices Among UnderRepresented Groups Evaluation) research program will provide a robust analysis of PCI versus CABG in women, and Black and Hispanic patients in two parallel clinical studies – RECHARGE: Women; and RECHARGE: Minorities. Each study will aim to recruit 600 participants at up to 60 study sites, primarily in the United States. Patients for whom PCI or CABG are equally appropriate options, as determined by their local heart team, will be randomized to receive either procedure. The trials will take place over five years following an 18-month feasibility phase. Previous randomized controlled trials of surgical options for coronary artery disease evaluated major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke and the need for repeat procedures. However, in focus groups, Gaudino and colleagues discovered that survival and quality of life were the outcomes that matter most to patients faced with a choice between PCI or CABG. “Patients care most about living longer and better,” he said. Gaudino, who is also the director of the Joint Clinical Trials Office and the director of translational and clinical research in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine, will oversee the RECHARGE program, including study startup and patient recruitment strategies. The co-principal investigator is Dr. Gregg Stone, director of academic affairs for the Mount Sinai Health System and professor of medicine and population health science and policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Stone will lead data collection and analysis.

James Webb Space Telescope sees Jupiter moons in a new light: With its sensitive infrared cameras and high-resolution spectrometer, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing new secrets of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites – in particular Ganymede, the largest moon, and Io, the most volcanically active. In two separate publications, astronomers who are part of JWST’s Early Release Science program report the first detection of hydrogen peroxide on Ganymede and sulfurous fumes on Io, both the result of Jupiter’s domineering influence. Samantha Trumbo, a 51 Pegasi b postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Astronomy in the College of Arts and Sciences, led the study of Ganymede, which published July 21 in Science Advances. Using measurements captured by the near infrared spectrometer on JWST, the team detected the absorption of light by hydrogen peroxide around the north and south poles of the moon, a result of charged particles around Jupiter and Ganymede impacting the ice that blankets the moon. “JWST revealing the presence of hydrogen peroxide at Ganymede’s poles shows for the first time that charged particles funneled along Ganymede’s magnetic field are preferentially altering the surface chemistry of its polar caps,” Trumbo said. The astronomers said the peroxide is produced by charged particles hitting the frozen water ice around the poles and breaking the water molecules into fragments – a process called radiolysis – which then recombine to form hydrogen peroxide. They suspected that radiolysis would occur primarily around the poles on Ganymede because, unlike all other moons in our solar system, it has a magnetic field that directs charged particles toward the poles. “Just like how Earth’s magnetic field directs charged particles from the sun to the highest latitudes, causing the aurora, Ganymede’s magnetic field does the same thing to charged particles from Jupiter’s magnetosphere,” she said. “Not only do these particles result in aurorae at Ganymede as well, but they also impact the icy surface.” Trumbo and Michael Brown, professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, where Trumbo recently received her Ph.D., had earlier studied hydrogen peroxide on Europa, another of Jupiter’s four Galilean satellites. On Europa, however, the peroxide was detectable over much of the surface, perhaps in part because it has no magnetic field to protect the surface from the fast-moving particles zipping around Jupiter. “This is likely a really important and widespread process,” Trumbo said. “These observations of Ganymede provide a key window to understand how such water radiolysis might drive chemistry on icy bodies throughout the outer solar system, including on neighboring Europa and Callisto (the fourth Galilean moon).” The second paper accepted for publication in the journal JGR: Planets, reports new JWST observations of Io that show several ongoing eruptions, including a brightening at a volcanic complex called Loki Patera, and an exceptionally bright eruption at Kanehekili Fluctus. Because Io is the only volcanically active moon in the solar system – Jupiter’s gravitational push and pull heats it up – studies like this give planetary scientists a different perspective than can be obtained by studying volcanoes on Earth. “This shows that we can do incredible science with the James Webb Space Telescope on solar system objects, even if the object is really very bright, like Jupiter, but also when you look at very faint things next to Jupiter,” said lead author Imke de Pater, professor emerita of astronomy and earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley. De Pater and Thierry Fouchet from the Paris Observatory are co-principal investigators for the Early Release Science solar system observation team, one of 13 teams given early access to the telescope.

Analysis of court transcripts reveals biased jury selection July 27, 2023 Cornell researchers have shown that data science and artificial intelligence tools can successfully identify when prosecutors question potential jurors differently, in an effort to prevent women and Black people from serving on juries. In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers used natural language processing (NLP) tools to analyze transcripts of the jury selection process. They found multiple quantifiable differences in how prosecutors questioned Black and white members of the jury pool. Once validated, this technology could provide evidence for appeals cases and be used in real time during jury selection to ensure more diverse juries. “One of the things the courts have looked at is whether the prosecutor questions Black and white jurors differently,” Blume said. “NLP software allows you to do that on a much more sophisticated level, looking at not just at the number, but the way in which the questions are put together.” Under the assumption that Black and female jurors will be more sympathetic to a defendant – especially a Black one – prosecutors will sometimes press them to reveal disqualifying information. A common tactic in capital cases is to provide an especially gruesome description of the execution process and then ask if the person would be willing to sentence the defendant to death. If the answer is no, that person is struck from the jury pool. To see if NLP software could identify this and other signs of disparate questioning, Blume collaborated with Martin Wells, the Charles A. Alexander Professor of Statistical Sciences in the Cornell Ann. S Bowers College of Computing and Information Science and director of research in the ILR School, and Effenberger to analyze transcripts from 17 capital cases in South Carolina. Their dataset included more than 26,000 questions that judges, defense attorneys and the prosecution asked potential jurors. The researchers looked not only at the number of questions asked of Black, white, male and female potential jurors, but also the topics covered, each question’s complexity and the parts of speech used. “We consistently found racial differences in a number of these measures,” Wells said. “When we do job interviews, we usually have a list of questions, and we want to ask everyone the same question, and here that’s not the case.” The analysis showed significant differences in the length, complexity and sentiment of the questions prosecutors asked of Black potential jurors compared to white ones, indicating they were likely attempting to shape their responses. The questions asked by judges and the defense showed no such racial differences. The study also found evidence that prosecutors had attempted to disqualify Black individuals by using their views on the death penalty. Prosecutors asked Black potential jurors – especially those who were ultimately excused from serving – more explicit and graphic questions about execution methods compared to white potential jurors. The researchers said the findings prove that NLP tools can successfully identify biased jury selection. Now, they hope to see similar studies performed on larger datasets with more diverse types of cases. Once the validity of this method is established, “this could be done during jury selection almost in real time,” Wells said. Whether used to monitor jury selection or to provide evidence for an appeal, this software could be a powerful tool to diversify juries – especially for defendants who are potentially facing the death penalty.

Balance, Nicholson honored for research, teaching and service: Two faculty members in the College of Arts and Sciences – Christine Balance, associate professor in the Department of Performing and Media Arts (PMA), and Linda Nicholson, professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, are the recipients of the 2023 Faculty Award for Excellence in Research, Teaching and Service through Diversity. President Martha E. Pollack and Provost Michael I. Kotlikoff announced the awards based on nominations from students, faculty, and staff, and the recommendations of a selection committee. The recognition comes with a $15,000 prize. “Professors Nicholson and Balance demonstrate exceptional commitment to creating inclusive spaces in their teaching, advising and research,” Pollack said. “I’m delighted that they are being recognized for their excellent work in preparing our students to engage in an increasingly diverse world.” Balance arrived as faculty at Cornell in 2018. Previously, she was in residence as an external faculty fellow with the Society for Humanities (2014-15). As director of AASP, she has helped establish the Asian American Studies graduate minor, collaborated with Derek Chang, associate professor of history (A&S), to start the Cornell Asian/Asian American Alumni Oral History Project and expanded the range of classes offered in both PMA and AASP. “Some of the work I’m most proud of while here at Cornell broadly brings attention to ‘anti-Asian racism’ – not just bias or discrimination or other languages of individual injury but a real accounting for how Asian America – its people, their histories and communities – have been shaped by structural racism in the U.S. and across the globe,” she said. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when hostilities soared against Asians and Asian Americans, Balance organized well-attended forums, including “Hate in the Time of COVID” and “Racism in America,” providing not only safe spaces for Asians and Asian Americans at Cornell but also opportunities to educate others about the historical context of anti-Asian sentiments. “Serving as faculty mentor for Cornell’s first Posse cohort – we have now hosted 10 cohorts and the 11th will arrive this fall – gave me the gift of seeing the undergraduate experience through the eyes of brilliant and resilient Posse scholars who are part of my chosen family,” Nicholson said. In 2020, Nicholson was the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences lead for diversity and inclusion for the multicollege Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. From 2016-20, she chaired the A&S Diversity and Inclusion Committee. Nicholson also has won several Cornell awards, including the Estevan Fuertes Award, the Robert A. And Donna B. Paul Award for Excellence in Advising, and the Kendall S. Carpenter Advising Award. She received the Graduate School’s Diversity and Inclusion Change Agent Award in 2022. As the director of undergraduate biology, Nicholson assists undergraduates in one of the most popular majors at Cornell. Her colleagues praised her efforts, including monthly meetings with instructors, to ensure that introductory biology courses meet the needs of all students. Launched in 2018, the Faculty Award for Excellence in Research, Teaching and Service through Diversity recognizes faculty for their sustained and transformational work promoting diversity through research, teaching and service. Nominations for recipients of the 2024 award will be solicited at this year’s end.

Creatively enhancing a CV, known as “resume padding,” has the potential to cast the sender in a bad light. But can this “self-reported signaling” – the conveying of information that may or may not be true – ultimately have a positive effect in the grand scheme of things? Two Cornell researchers think so. “If you wind up using resume padding to get a higher-level job that you’re not qualified for – and that job is really important, like the [U.S. Rep.] George Santos case – that’s not a good thing,” said Michael Waldman, the Charles H. Dyson Professor of Management in the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, in the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business. But, Waldman said, resume padding can ultimately have a positive effect – if the long-term result is decreased misrepresentation. Waldman is co-author of “Self-Reported Signaling,” which published July 27 in American Economic Journal: Microeconomics. The other author is Thomas Jungbauer, assistant professor of strategy and business economics at Johnson. The difference between the two concepts: In Spence’s world, the signal is always valid. In self-reported signaling, the signal can be a lie, as in the Santos case. A CV is an example of self-reported signaling: Most of the information on it is not widely known, and the recipient expects it to be accurate and truthful. There are items that can be verified via investigation – education level, previous employment – and others that cannot, such as leadership qualities and work ethic.  But verification is costly. In their modeling, the researchers considered a single sender (job applicant) and a pool of identical receivers (hiring officers). The sender chooses an action (education level) that is not publicly known but can be verified, although at a potentially high cost in time and money. Assumptions regarding the veracity of the resumes, the hiring officers’ willingness to verify the information, and the risk-benefit of dishonesty regarding education levels are factored into the model. Their modeling uncovered two major results: 1.	The possibility of resume padding reduces the return to investing in higher education levels. This is because, even if the claim of a higher education level is truthful, the possibility that it could be untruthful lowers the amount hiring officers are willing to pay; and 2.	The subsequent reduction in investments in education can “undo” the overinvestment typically associated with signaling, thus increasing the “social welfare,” as the researchers call it, of all senders. “There is the possibility,” Jungbauer said, “that all this misrepresentation just lowers the incentive of investing in the signal, whether it be education or other standard activities that serve as signals, which could have a positive effect on the economy.” The researchers also applied this modeling to college admissions – particularly in the area of applicants’ self-reported extracurricular activities and leadership roles. Their modeling and analysis revealed that the possibility of misrepresentation reduces overinvestment in these types of activities, and may actually increase overall social welfare. “We typically think of lying as being unambiguously bad,” the authors wrote. “At the same time, however, we know that signaling results in distortions which serve to lower social welfare. If self-reports of actions serve as signals … there can be a social welfare benefit as the misrepresentation reduces the signaling distortion.” Waldman said the nonstop news regarding Santos’ misrepresenting his past could trigger a lessening of that type of behavior. Waldman and Jungbauer are both affiliated with the field of economics at Cornell, in addition to their primary appointments at Johnson.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many U.S. hospitals had overcapacity intensive care units (ICU) while other area hospitals had open ICU beds available, a phenomenon known as “load imbalance.” The hospitals most likely to be overloaded in imbalanced regions served a higher number of Black patients and more patients enrolled in Medicaid, according to a new study conducted by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. In the study, published July 5 in Health Affairs, more than half of the regions studied experienced a load imbalance. “The research highlights the need for better coordination of patient transfers, which can alleviate overcapacity and ease inequities in care,” said senior study author William L. Schpero, assistant professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine. This study appears to be the first to closely examine the prevalence of hospital load imbalance during the pandemic and the type of hospitals that were affected, according to the study’s lead author, Dr. Adam S. Vohra, an interventional cardiology fellow in the Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. For their study, the researchers assessed data from 290 hospital referral regions (HRRs), which are geographic areas that designate hospital markets. Data on hospital capacity came from the COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity files, produced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The research team found that 154 HRRs, or 53.1%, experienced load imbalance during the study period, from July 31, 2020, through March 4, 2022. Regions with the most load imbalance had a higher proportion of residents who identified as Black. Moreover, hospitals with the highest proportion of Medicaid patients and Black Medicare patients were significantly more likely to be overloaded while other area hospitals had available capacity. “We think we used a fairly conservative estimate of an imbalance, so if anything, we may be underestimating its prevalence,” Schpero said. Some of the overburdened hospitals likely did not have enough staff, beds or supplies to safely meet patient needs, Schpero said. “Those resources did exist elsewhere,” he said, “but many states have historically not had the infrastructure needed to address capacity constraints across hospitals and to reallocate patients accordingly.” Arizona, Minnesota and Washington, for example, have centralized coordinating hubs to manage transfer requests among hospitals during periods of high surge to help relieve the burden on overwhelmed hospitals. Most of these systems rely on critical care or emergency department nurses and technicians to facilitate patient transfers. “While we haven’t followed up on the causal effect these coordinating hubs have on outcomes, in theory, these are the kind of the systems that could help,” Vohra said. Moving patients from one hospital to another can be quite difficult, and transfer systems require timely data on patient need and bed availability across hospitals. Reporting mechanisms that only update weekly are too slow, Schpero said. “There needs to be a preexisting agreement across hospitals, either voluntarily or as a function of state law, to share real-time data on hospital capacity and facilitate transfers to ease strain,” he said. Because the urgency of the pandemic has subsided, “now is the time to take stock and invest in policies and practices that capitalize on lessons learned,” Schpero said. “Whether another pandemic arises, or a natural disaster occurs, we shouldn’t have to compromise on equitable patient care.”

The Cornell University Hospital for Animals has added a cutting-edge service for companion animals: a new technology capable of cleansing patients’ blood outside of their bodies. This opens the door to several new treatment options, including dialysis for animals with kidney failure and immune-mediated diseases. The new technology – an extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) unit – came online this spring for cats and dogs. Only about 35 other animal hospitals across the country have such capabilities. Cornell’s is the only one in the region; the nearest other facilities offering this technology are in New York City and Philadelphia. “The ability to provide dialysis and other extracorporeal blood purification to the patients in the upstate New York region is a game changer for our veterinary hospital,” said Dr. Jethro Forbes, assistant clinical professor in the Section of Emergency and Critical Care. “Among other things, we can be your pet’s artificial kidneys for a few weeks while these resilient organs are given a chance to heal.” While a standard treatment in people, kidney dialysis is less common in veterinary practices due to the intensive training needed to establish and run the technology. “It’s a smaller community of high-level practitioners, but it’s growing rapidly,” Forbes said. An EBP unit improves the lives of animals in multiple ways. Dialysis for pets in kidney failure is among the most common; the unit essentially cleanses a patient’s blood of bodily toxins, much like an actual kidney. For animals whose kidneys cannot function normally, being put on dialysis could make a lifesaving difference. Removing a toxin or drug from the bloodstream is another common use of an EBP unit. “Sometimes our pets get into things they shouldn’t, like medications or chemicals. For example, this machine can cleanse the blood of antifreeze or anti-inflammatory drugs in just a few hours of treatment, before the toxins can cause damage to your cat or dog’s organs,” said Forbes, who has worked with EBP units in previous work at private specialty practices across the United States. When an animal’s immune system isn’t functioning properly, this technology can also help manage it through an EBP therapy called therapeutic plasma exchange. One particular disease, immune mediated hemolytic anemia, results in immune system destruction of the body’s own red blood cells. Such a severe, life-threatening illness requires extensive hospitalization and specialty-level care, including immune-suppressing medication and blood transfusions. Therapeutic plasma exchange can actually remove dangerous elements of the malfunctioning immune system by exchanging the pet’s plasma using an extracorporeal filter, weeding the attackers out. “The animal will still need standard care with medications, but this therapy removes the immune system’s weapons to give those medications the best chance at making a difference,” Forbes said. Possibilities for expanding the EBP unit’s capabilities include configuring it for more species, such as horses, pigs and goats, or using different components that could clear a patients’ blood of bacteria and viruses. With the right materials, this unit could even assist in cutting-edge cancer therapies and bone marrow transplants. Said Forbes: “It’s exciting to see what’s on the horizon. Right now, we’re thrilled to be able to offer this treatment for dogs and cats at Cornell, while also training the next generation of veterinary specialists to provide this care to even more pets.”

Large neural networks, a form of artificial intelligence, can generate thousands of jokes along the lines of “Why did the chicken cross the road?” But do they understand why they’re funny? Using hundreds of entries from the New Yorker magazine’s Cartoon Caption Contest as a testbed, researchers challenged AI models and humans with three tasks: matching a joke to a cartoon; identifying a winning caption; and explaining why a winning caption is funny. In all tasks, humans performed demonstrably better than machines, even as AI advances such as ChatGPT have closed the performance gap. So are machines beginning to “understand” humor? In short, they’re making some progress, but aren’t quite there yet. “The way people challenge AI models for understanding is to build tests for them – multiple choice tests or other evaluations with an accuracy score,” said Jack Hessel, Ph.D. ’20, research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2). “And if a model eventually surpasses whatever humans get at this test, you think, ‘OK, does this mean it truly understands?’ It’s a defensible position to say that no machine can truly `understand’ because understanding is a human thing. But, whether the machine understands or not, it’s still impressive how well they do on these tasks.” For their study, the researchers compiled 14 years’ worth of New Yorker caption contests – more than 700 in all. Each contest included: a captionless cartoon; that week’s entries; the three finalists selected by New Yorker editors; and, for some contests, crowd quality estimates for each submission. For each contest, the researchers tested two kinds of AI – “from pixels” (computer vision) and “from description” (analysis of human summaries of cartoons) – for the three tasks. “There are datasets of photos from Flickr with captions like, ‘This is my dog,’” Hessel said. “The interesting thing about the New Yorker case is that the relationships between the images and the captions are indirect, playful, and reference lots of real-world entities and norms. And so the task of ‘understanding’ the relationship between these things requires a bit more sophistication.” In the experiment, matching required AI models to select the finalist caption for the given cartoon from among “distractors” that were finalists but for other contests; quality ranking required models to differentiate a finalist caption from a nonfinalist; and explanation required models to generate free text saying how a high-quality caption relates to the cartoon. Hessel penned the majority of human-generated explanations himself, after crowdsourcing the task proved unsatisfactory. He generated 60-word explanations for more than 650 cartoons. “A number like 650 doesn’t seem very big in a machine-learning context, where you often have thousands or millions of data points,” Hessel said, “until you start writing them out.” While AI might not be able to “understand” humor yet, the authors wrote, it could be a collaborative tool humorists could use to brainstorm ideas. The authors wrote this paper in the spirit of the subject matter, with playful comments and footnotes throughout.

Researchers are hoping a fly no larger than a grain of rice and a predatory beetle may work together to combat an invasive pest that is devastating hemlocks in Fall Creek and throughout eastern North America. Cornell Botanic Gardens staff and Cornell’s New York State Hemlock Initiative released 700 silver flies in the Fall Creek South Natural Area in June. The team hopes the silver flies, and a beetle released there in 2022, may offer a long-term biological solution to the hemlock woolly adelgid, which poses one of the most significant risks for hemlock populations. While both species have been released in Cornell Botanic Gardens before, Fall Creek South is the first area where both will exist together, offering researchers insights into whether they will successfully fight the hemlock woolly adelgid. The hemlock plays a crucial role in the area’s ecosystem. Its dense canopy creates a cool, shaded habitat suitable for specific plants and animals to thrive. Its branching roots filter water and reduce soil erosion, increasing water quality. The tree’s dense shade also delays snow melt in the spring, which provides stream-flows needed for trout and other fish. Native to the American Northwest, both the beetle, Laricobius nigrinus, and the silver fly, Leucotaraxis piniperda, hunt adelgids and are naturally suited for a colder climate. Similar to its prey, the silver fly also reproduces twice a year, meaning it can feed on hemlock woolly adelgids as the pests reproduce. “You have these predators that are essentially feeding on the same thing,” said Nick Dietschler, research support specialist from the hemlock initiative. “In our research, we are trying to understand the niche specialization between the two species. Because they’ve co-evolved with each other, they’re likely going to find the same niches here on the East Coast as in their native Northwest.” Cornell Botanic Gardens’ natural area stewards have protected more than 2,000 trees with insecticide bark applications and trunk injections in 15 natural areas. In anticipation of biocontrol introduction, staff strategically left some hemlocks untreated. These trees will allow hemlock woolly adelgid populations to remain stable enough for predator populations to adequately establish themselves with a steady supply of food. The short-term goal is for the predators to remain for three years, marking their establishment in the area. Researchers hope that the silver fly, a strong flier, will spread in time and aid hemlocks in the surrounding area. Because pesticide applications last five to seven years, many trees in Fall Creek will approach insecticide reapplication within the next few years. Currently, the team plans to reassess the area in 2024, which would allow predator populations time to establish a presence there; that will help the team determine if pesticides are still required after the biocontrol agents have been released. The long-term conservation plan for Fall Creek will depend on several factors, including predator establishment, hemlock woolly adelgid populations and the condition of the trees. Despite the uncertainty, the mission remains steady: to conserve as many hemlock trees as possible, Bittner says. “If in 100 years, we have hundreds of hemlocks in this area, that’s a success.”

A Cornell researcher and her colleagues have solved one key piece of the molecular puzzle needed to dramatically improve plant productivity and increase carbon sequestration: They have successfully transferred key regions of a highly efficient red algae into a tobacco plant, using bacteria as an intermediary. The study was co-authored by Laura Gunn, assistant professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science Plant Biology Section in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and featured on the cover of the June 8 issue of Nature Plants. The study centers on Rubisco, the most abundant protein across every ecosystem on Earth. Rubisco performs the first step of photosynthesis by fixing carbon, and it appears in various forms in a wide array of organisms, including plants, red and green algae and bacteria. Rubisco is slow and struggles to differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide, a problem Gunn and several other Cornellians are working on. As a result, Rubisco often limits plant growth and crop yield. One species of red algae, Griffithsia monilis (Gm), contains Rubisco that is 30% more efficient at fixing carbon than Rubisco in other organisms, including terrestrial crops. For at least 20 years, scientists have been interested in transplanting the highly efficient GmRubisco into plants such as rice, wheat, soybean and tobacco to increase their productivity; however, until now, no one has been able to successfully coax plants to express it. This is because Rubisco requires multiple “chaperones” that are essential for the protein to fold, assemble and be active  – there are seven such helpers in tobacco plants – and most of the chaperones in red algae are unknown, Gunn said. In their study, Gunn and her co-authors were able to solve the 3D structure of GmRubisco and use this information to successfully graft a small number of regions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsRubisco) into a bacterial Rubisco. “RsRubisco is not very efficient, but it is very closely related to GmRubisco – they’re like cousins – which means that unlike land-plant Rubisco, it accepts the grafted sequences,” Gunn said. “RsRubisco also doesn't need any special chaperones for it to fold and assemble in land plants.” The change increased the carboxylation rate – the speed at which Rubisco starts the carbon fixation process – by 60%, increased carboxylation efficiency by 22% and improved RsRubisco’s ability to distinguish between carbon dioxide and oxygen by 7%. The authors then transplanted their bacterial mutant into tobacco, where it doubled photosynthesis and plant growth, compared to tobacco grown with unaltered RsRubisco. Tobacco is the easiest land plant in which to manipulate Rubisco and so serves as the test case for developing a more efficient Rubisco that can be transferred to more agronomically relevant species, Gunn said. “We’re not at the point where we’re outperforming wild-type tobacco, but we’re on the right trajectory,” Gunn said. “We only need fairly modest improvements to Rubisco performance, because even a very small increase over a whole growing season can lead to massive changes in plant growth and yield, and the potential applications span many sectors: higher agricultural production; more efficient and affordable biofuel production; carbon sequestration approaches; and artificial energy possibilities.” The research was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis, Formas Future Research Leaders and the European Regional Development Fund.

Srinagesh Gavirneni, professor of operations, technology and information management, an expert in supply-chain information sharing and a beloved mentor to students and junior faculty, died unexpectedly in Ithaca. He was 56. Gavirneni joined the faculty of the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, part of the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, in 2004. At Cornell, he made fundamental academic contributions to supply-chain information sharing, and he was highly regarded for his passion for practical impact, applying his research to problems in health care, agriculture and humanitarian logistics in developing countries. “I knew Professor Gavirneni as a caring friend, a jovial person and a sharp scholar in the operations management community and the Johnson School,” said Vishal Gaur, the Anne and Elmer Lindseth Dean and Emerson Professor of Manufacturing Management in the Johnson School. “He was a selfless mentor to our doctoral students and junior faculty, and was known for his interdisciplinary research, for which he built connections across the university. We share the grief of his loss with his family and friends.” Born and raised in India, Gavirneni completed his bachelor’s in mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, in 1989, and received master’s degrees from Iowa State University and Carnegie Mellon University in 1993 and 1994, respectively. He completed his Ph.D. in manufacturing and operations systems at Carnegie Mellon University in 1997. Before coming to Cornell, Gavirneni was an assistant professor in the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University and a research scientist at Schlumberger in Austin, Texas. In addition to supply-chain management, his research and teaching at Cornell included inventory control, production scheduling, simulation and optimization. He taught the Semester in Strategic Operations immersion course, a critical component of the Cornell MBA curriculum, for which he built relationships with a number of local companies across industries. Gavirneni was a finalist for the Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Best Paper Award in 2016. In 2017, he received an award for the Best Theory-Driven Empirical Paper at the Decision Sciences Institute Annual Conference, and won the Cornell Center for Hospitality Research Industry Relevance Award that same year. And in 2018, he won the Outstanding Associate Editor Award from the Journal of Decision Sciences.  “Dr. Gavirneni was an outstanding scholar, a prolific researcher and a dedicated teacher, and his impact on our college and the field was significant,” said Andrew Karolyi, the Charles Field Knight Dean of the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business. “I am deeply grateful for the time Nagesh and I served on the faculty together and for our many compelling conversations. On behalf of the Johnson School and the SC Johnson College of Business, I extend my deepest condolences to Dr. Gavirneni’s family, colleagues, and many friends.” Colleagues said Gavirneni deeply cared about the people around him, befriending everyone he met and remembering their life stories in detail. His office in Sage Hall was never locked, and all were welcome to stop by at any time. Gavirneni is survived by his wife, Ramadevi; his children, Siddharth Gavirneni ’21 and Meghana Gavirneni ’23; his parents Surendranath and Rajyalakshmi Gavirneni; and his siblings, Srinivas Gavirneni and Sridevi Paleti.

Connection is one of the most crucial components of building a unified and efficient workplace. And with thousands of Cornell employees scattered across campus, the country and even the world, the opportunities to connect are endless. This summer, Cornell is offering several resources for employees to build relationships in and out of the workplace – one of which is simply having a cup of coffee and a conversation. “Cornell CoworkerCoffee” is now available to all employees university-wide as a fun and easy way to meet new colleagues. Those who sign up will be randomly matched to a Cornell colleague once every month. Matches can then set up a time to meet virtually or in person for a “coffee” and the chance to chat. This offers an excellent opportunity to meet colleagues outside of typical working teams and units. Lisa Patz, director of human resources at Cornell, recently matched with an employee of Mann Library. They had the chance to connect in person at Goldwin Smith Hall in June. “Meeting with my CoworkerCoffee match was such a pleasure,” Patz said. “He was so friendly and engaging, and it was great to see how his experience has been as a newer employee at Cornell. I also enjoyed learning what activities he likes to do outside of work. As a university, I think we should continue to help our staff members tap into different areas of Cornell and the Ithaca region. I sincerely believe this opportunity will help do so and is one way to easily enhance a sense of belonging among divisions at Cornell.” CoworkerCoffee is just one of the many ways employees can forge connections across the university. Earlier this month, the Summer Wellbeing Adventure launched and encourages employees to discover ways to nourish their wellbeing over the course of a four-week campaign. Each week, participants focus on a theme: chill, explore, connect and sustain. So far, employees have taken the time to try new recipes, visit exhibitions and different parts of campus and rest and recharge with some of their favorite activities. This week, July 24-28, is “Connect Week,” and participants are prompted to engage in activities within their community and discover fun ways to build bonds in the workplace. For those who are looking for a way to participate, CoworkerCoffee offers the perfect chance to branch out and meet someone new, no matter where you work. Michelle Wescott, director of instructional design at eCornell, works remotely from Rochester, NY and recognizes the positive impact that connecting with her coworkers has had on her overall wellbeing thus far. “I’ve been checking the group on Viva Engage every day,” Crystal Davis, community nutrition educator for Cornell Cooperative Extension Albany, said. “I love reading about and seeing photos from other people’s adventures and discoveries. So far, I’ve looked up a couple of places that are new to me that I’d like to visit. It makes me look forward to sharing my own adventures too.” Employees will soon be able to join Workforce Affinity Groups (WAGs) on Viva Engage as well, which are volunteer, employee-run connection groups for faculty and staff based on shared interests. A Cornell WAG aims to help employees thrive and feel a greater sense of belonging. Employees can even submit ideas for a WAG by filling out the WAG Application to help build a community and start connecting.

Cornell’s laboratories and classrooms are full of complex technology and state-of-the-art equipment; keeping these facilities running smoothly is crucial to the university’s missions of research and instruction. As an HVAC Controls Technician Journey Person at Cornell, Carlos Ribellia troubleshoots, repairs and monitors heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment for facilities campus-wide. “I like the detective work,” Ribellia said. “One day, I could be working on something really simple, a quick fix that takes thirty minutes, and the next day, it could be another issue that is completely different and has cascaded into a big problem.” While on active duty, Ribellia juggled his academics alongside field exercises. He took advantage of classes offered online and in person at the military base. Whether it was late at night or during his lunch breaks, Ribellia persisted through coursework while balancing the demands of military life. He pursued an Associate of Arts in General Studies, which allowed him to finish his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (Operations Research) shortly after he got out. “The primary reason why I wanted to further my education was because of my mother, who went back to school for nursing while I started my career in the Navy,” Ribellia said. “I remember her pushing through her studies every day and night, and, on top of that, she had two part-time jobs. That makes me very proud. And if she could do it, I knew I could do it and make her proud as well.” Ribellia’s mother passed away from pancreatic cancer before he was able to finish his bachelor’s degree, but he attributes much of his academic success to his mother’s strength and motivation. While deployed, Ribellia was recognized for his relief efforts in Sri Lanka after the Indonesia Tsunami (2004) and in Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina (2005). He received two humanitarian service medals for his work to help restore schools and residential areas. In 2013, after eight years of service in the Navy and after finishing his enlistment in Okinawa, Japan, Ribellia arrived at Cornell. He was first hired at the university as a second-year electrical apprentice, working on HVAC building automation systems. Ribellia tapped into Cornell’s academic benefits for employees and has been inspired to continue his journey in higher education and a new career. Ribellia’s passion for helping people during times of crisis lead him to a Master of Industrial and Labor Relations program at Cornell, where he hopes to pursue a career in human resources. The motivation for this career jump stemmed from another member of his family – this time, his daughter. “My daughter is very high on the spectrum for autism,” Ribellia said. “I had a hard time juggling her needs and appointments, and human resources at Cornell really helped me by providing exactly what I needed to care for her. They were supportive and made sure that I understood my rights and the benefits that were available as an employee. It really motivated me to want to be in an HR role.” “Every hardship thrown my way has shaped me into a resilient and compassionate person,” Ribellia said. “My experiences made me want to find the sense of security I did not have as a child. The most rewarding thing for me is that the obstacles I’ve faced in my life have paid off, and now, I not only work at Cornell but get to take courses here too. It’s been a surreal experience.”

Omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in fish and fish oil supplements, appear promising for maintaining lung health, according to a Cornell-led study supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The large, multifaceted study in healthy adults provides the strongest evidence to date of this association and underscores the importance of including omega-3 fatty acids in the diet, especially given that many Americans do not meet current guidelines, the researchers said. “We know a lot about the role of diet in cancer and cardiovascular diseases, but the role of diet in chronic lung disease is somewhat understudied,” said Patricia A. Cassano, the Alan D. Mathios Professor in the College of Human Ecology (CHE) and director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences, which is housed jointly in CHE and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “This study adds to growing evidence that omega-3 fatty acids, which are part of a healthy diet, may be important for lung health, too.” There is increased interest in trying to understand whether nutritional interventions could help prevent lung disease, according to the researchers. Past studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may help, due largely to their established anti-inflammatory actions, but robust studies of this association have been lacking. To learn more, the researchers developed a two-part study investigating the link between omega-3 fatty acid levels in the blood and lung function over time. In the first part, the researchers conducted a longitudinal, observational study involving more than 15,000 diverse Americans from the NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study – a large collection of NIH-funded studies that helps researchers to study determinants of personalized risk for chronic lung disease. The longitudinal study showed that higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in a person’s blood were associated with a reduced rate of lung function decline. The researchers observed the strongest associations for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid that is found at high levels in fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines. DHA is also available as a dietary supplement. In the second part, the researchers analyzed genetic data from a large study of European patients (more than 500,000 participants) from the UK Biobank. They studied certain genetic markers in the blood as an indirect measure for dietary omega-3 fatty acid levels to see how they correlated with lung health. The results showed that higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids – including DHA – were associated with better lung function. One caveat of the current study is that it only included healthy adults. As part of this ongoing project led by Cassano and Dana Hancock, senior vice president at RTI International, a nonprofit research institute headquartered in North Carolina, the researchers are collaborating with the COPDGene Study to examine blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids in relation to the rate of decline in lung function among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – including heavy smokers – to see if the same beneficial associations are found. “We’re starting to turn a corner in nutritional research and really moving toward precision nutrition for treating lung diseases,” Patchen said. “In the future, this could translate into individualized dietary recommendations for people at high risk for chronic lung disease.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “Dietary Guidelines for Americans” recommends that people eat at least two to three servings of fish per week, a goal most Americans don’t meet. In addition to fish and fish oil, other sources of omega-3 fatty acids include nuts and seeds, plant oils and fortified foods.

An interdisciplinary research team received a five-year, $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation to develop a new generation of biosynthetic lubricants that have the potential to treat arthritis and reduce the painful friction of artificial joints. A confocal reflectance micrograph shows a bioengineered lubricant (in green) on the surface of articular cartilage. The collaboration was initially spurred by an “aha” moment 10 years ago, when Bonassar attended a presentation by one of Putnam’s doctoral students describing new biomaterials to prevent surgical adhesions. One specific synthetic polymer caught Bonassar’s attention because it bore an uncanny resemblance to lubricin, a natural glycoprotein that is secreted in the synovial joint. “Lubricin looks like a bottlebrush. It’s got a linear protein core and a whole bunch of little, short sugar side-chains on it,” Bonassar said. “Dave’s student presented a new polymer that looked a lot like that. And I thought, hey, if you’re making polymers for this other purpose, maybe we could tune the way you make those polymers to be a good lubricant for cartilage.” For nearly two decades, Bonassar has been studying the mechanics and repair of cartilage, which, thanks to its lubricating properties, has the lowest coefficient of friction of any material ever made. “If you think about slippery surfaces, like ice on ice or Teflon on Teflon, cartilage is a factor of 10 lower in friction than any of these things,” Bonassar said. “And the field is still figuring out why.” Bonassar’s lab had developed specialty instrumentation that can measure these tiny friction coefficients and identify the crucial molecular components that drive cartilage’s ultra-efficient lubrication: lubricin and hyaluronic acid. Together, they form a hydrophilic complex that draws water to the tissue surface, lubricating it. In the cases of arthritis and traumatic injuries, this biopolymer layer is disturbed, which decreases the lubricating properties and increases stress on the tissue, damaging its cells. Bonassar and Putnam successfully created a synthetic polymer that mimics the function of lubricin, and over the years their collaboration expanded to include Paszek, who specializes in glycoprotein engineering which enabled tailoring natural biopolymers to fit different applications, and Reesink, who lent her expertise in using animal models to validate the therapeutics. “As we collaborated and began to meet regularly, it occurred to me, this is such a critical mass of people with unique skill sets,” Bonassar said. “We have the ability to work as a group in a way that is much more effective than four of us working in parallel. There’s the possibility of Dave and Matt designing new molecules, we test them for their lubricating ability in vitro, and Heidi tests them for their therapeutic potential in vivo. And we can use that to go around this design loop to continue to optimize and make better and better lubricants for different applications.” In addition to treating arthritis and joint pain, biosynthetic lubricants could address a host of physical ailments, from dry eyes and skin abrasions to inflammatory bowel disease and certain digestive and reproductive issues – essentially anything involving mucosal layers that are unable to localize water to a surface. “We hope that five years from now we’ve got great candidates for injectable treatments for arthritis, that we have compelling data in animals to say that these could move forward in the developmental process, and that we have general paradigms we can use and export to think about tailoring different lubricants for other kinds of medical applications,” Bonassar said.

Using an innovative method for measuring doctor turnover, Weill Cornell Medicine researchers determined that between 2010 and 2018, the annual rate at which physicians left their practices increased by 43%, from 5.3% to 7.6% a year. The causes of this trend are not known, but warrant further investigation, according to the researchers. Whether doctors are moving to new practices or retiring, “it is important to study turnover because it can hurt the continuity and quality of patients care,” said study co-author Dr. Lawrence Casalino, professor emeritus of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine. “There’s a lot of mutual trust that builds between a doctor and patient over time that’s difficult to replace.” The study authors, led by Amelia Bond, assistant professor of health policy and economics in the department of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, developed a new method to estimate turnover primarily using the Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty (MD-PPAS). This database contains information on clinician characteristics such as age and sex, physician specialty and tax identification numbers of the practices in which physicians work. Using this data, the researchers developed an algorithm allowing them to estimate physician turnover from 2010 through the first three quarters of 2020. “I think this method may become the gold standard to identify turnover in the years to come,” Casalino said, adding that prior estimates using surveys have been unreliable in assessing turnover.  The researchers found that between 2010 and 2018, the annual rate of turnover, based on doctors moving or not practicing anymore, increased from 5.3 to 7.6%, a change of 43%. “While the percentage change from year to year seemed somewhat modest, the percentage change over time was quite large,” Casalino said. Most of the turnover occurred between 2010 and 2014 and resulted from doctors who stopped practicing. The reason turnover increased during those years remains unknown. Turnover may also create further barriers to accessing care for people living in rural areas and for underserved communities. The researchers observed that doctors in rural areas were more likely to move or to stop practicing medicine than urban doctors. Female doctors were more prone to turnover than male doctors. Physicians in larger practices were more likely to experience turnover than those in single-doctor or two-physician practices. Doctors who took care of more patients who were eligible for Medicare and Medicaid were also more disposed to turnover. Following 2014, turnover rates remained stable through 2017, and then rose slightly in 2018. Turnover – based on data about moving – was slightly lower in the second and third quarters of 2020 than in the corresponding quarters of 2019. While a great deal of turnover did not seem to be occurring early in the COVID-19 pandemic, “researchers need to look at the next year of two of data to get a better understanding of any pandemic trends,” Casalino said. In addition to revealing more about COVID-19 physician turnover, the method will also make it possible to determine how much turnover occurs after a private equity company, a health insurer or a hospital acquires a physician practice. “Once we know the reasons behind doctor turnover, individual practices or hospitals can better develop programs to retain their providers,” Casalino said. “That’s why we’re making our algorithm public for other researchers to use.”

LinkedIn introductions that emphasize a professional “journey” rather than listing achievements make a stronger positive impression, according to new Cornell research. Written stories including career ups and downs are also more effective at creating a connection than videos, the research found. “We define ‘journey’ as a long and often difficult process of going from one point to another, which reflects a determination to learn, an acquisition of skills, and a sense of growth and development,” said Ovul Sezer, assistant professor at the Cornell Peter and Stephanie Nolan School of Hotel Administration and co-author of “It’s the Journey, Not Just the Destination: Conveying Interpersonal Warmth in Written Introductions,” which published in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes in July. “For example, obstacles one faced or learning processes they went through could be great information to include in one’s personal story,” Sezer said. “We find that journey information leads to greater perceptions of warmth because journeys help to communicate humility, mitigating the appearance of arrogance often associated with self-promotion.” Sezer and co-authors Kelly Nault, assistant professor at IE Business School in Madrid, and Nadav Klein, assistant professor at INSEAD in France, wanted to understand how people can introduce themselves with a high level of effectiveness and success. Following several different studies drawing from publicly available data from LinkedIn, they discovered that users prefer written introductions that describe a journey because personal stories make people appear humbler, and humility is a key ingredient to creating a connection and conveying warmth. In four pilot studies, the researchers surveyed working professionals to understand how people view introductions. They found that introductions are seen as opportunities for self-promotion, and raise concerns about coming across as lacking humility. Eighty-one of 121 participants explicitly mentioned self-promotion as inherent to professional introductions, and 59 expressed feelings of discomfort. Although people seek to create favorable impressions on others in general, they are particularly interested in creating positive impressions on those who make hiring decisions. In one study the researchers tested whether  human resource specialists evaluate written introductions which reference a professional journey more favorably than introductions with only achievement information. The researchers recruited 332 HR professionals and provided them with the LinkedIn introductions used in previous studies to evaluate how those introductions were perceived. Overall, HR specialists viewed candidates who provided more journey information as warmer, partly because they appeared humbler. Perceptions of warmth generated by journey-oriented introductions, the researchers found, played a key role in influencing HR specialists’ desire to connect with the job seeker. The researchers wanted to probe how one navigates the fine line between presenting professional competency and coming across as arrogant. “Although delivering an effective written introduction is important, how to do so is less clear,” Sezer said. “One of Mark Twain’s popular quotes was, ‘Success is a journey, not a destination,’ and those sentiments capture the essence and value of our research.”

More than a decade ago, jet-lagged textile expert Juan Hinestroza landed in Xintang, China, and took a walk near a large creek. He noticed the water was a strange color – indigo blue, from highly toxic dyes, pigments and finishes dumped from a neighboring textile factory. Now Hinestroza and a multidisciplinary team of Cornell chemists and engineers are reaching into a chemistry toolbox to clean up another formidable environmental foe: polyester textile waste. The team has created a way to break down old polyester clothing and reuse some of its compounds to make fabrics that are fire resistant, anti-bacterial or wrinkle-free – and to halt the proliferation of garment waste in landfills. It’s a circular approach that is in line with the United Nations Environment Programme, which has begun a worldwide effort to end the developed world’s overconsumption of clothing. The number of times clothing gets worn has decreased 36% in the past two decades, according to the program. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that each person in the United States discards more than 70 pounds of textiles annually. What’s worse, the report said, more than 85% of textile waste settles in landfills. Yelin Ko stands before the quiet hum of a laboratory fume hood in the Human Ecology Building and faces three magnetic stirrers. She loads a thimble full of colorful strips of polyester fabrics into a small round-bottom flask and then pours a sodium hydroxide solution to cover the textile. With agitation, a little applied heat, ethanol and cooling water, those tiny pieces of polyester cloth – made of polyethylene terephthalate, the kind of goop from which plastic soda bottles also are made – will become a laboratory soup. The scientists can then extract the old fabric’s monomers from the soup and use them to create linkers to be assembled into metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs. These MOF structures can be used to create coatings on clothing that protect people from germs or noxious gases, to shield firefighters from fire or other uses not yet imagined, says Ko, a doctoral student in the field of fiber science and a Fulbright Scholarship recipient who works in Hinestroza’s laboratory. Reduced from polyester fiber, an array of metal-organic frameworks is shown in the Hinestroza lab. Minor changes in the chemical structure can generate a myriad of colors. “With the right metal salts, like some copper salts, we can chemically grab the organic molecule from the monomers recovered from these digested textiles,” Milner said. “The chemistry is all governed by this idea of self-assembly, which is that the components themselves want to become an ordered structure,” Milner says. The scientists add copper salts to an acid to create a precursor solution, which they then bring to the soup of depolymerized polyester. “The natural process keeps going until it builds an extended structure – the MOFs – which is what comes out of the solution.” The team believes that the new techniques can disrupt the business-as-usual textile and apparel processes, which they say are unsustainable, says Suntivich, an electrochemist and material scientist. “Plastic recycling is a challenge obviously, so we’re going about it in this context. I’m seeing MOFs as just a way for me to enable the recycling of the material.” However, the professors know that to succeed, their technique must be adaptable to existing industry practices, Hinestroza says. Ideally, the team hopes that manufacturers use the MOF chemistry in existing infrastructure. “Trying to incorporate new equipment into new processes is always difficult,” he says. “You can develop a unique chemistry, but if you need new equipment to process the material, then there will be a lot of resistance.”

How to harness the potential of highly reactive radical molecules to work in pairs and spur transformative chemistry? Bulk them up. That is the approach of a new Cornell-led collaboration that attached large fragments to the infamously temperamental molecules, increasing their girth to insulate them from their hyperreactive partners. Cornell researchers bulked up highly reactive radical molecules by attaching groups of carbon and hydrogen atoms to their surface, effectively giving each molecule a set of antlers that allowed them to preserve their native reactivity while keeping their partner at a safe distance. The technique could prove to be a boon for creating new and improved derivatives of pharmaceutical compounds. The project, led by Song Lin, professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, emerged from the Lin Group’s previous experiments with synthetic electrochemistry. In that process, electrodes pass an electrical current through a chemical reaction to activate inert molecules that will form chemical bonds that otherwise might not be achievable. Electrochemistry also happens to be one of the most efficient ways to generate high reactive radicals from simple chemical feedstocks. “That’s where we thought, hey, when we have these radicals, how can we control them as well? If you can harness them and use them to react with a pharmaceutical, they can do really cool chemistry,” Lin said. “It’s really our interest in electrochemistry and radical chemistry that allowed us to think about these fundamental problems.” Radicals are highly reactive, but they have the potential to bond in pairs by sharing a pair of single electrons. The challenge is getting them close enough to cooperate without annihilating each other. The researchers’ solution was to bulk up the radicals by attaching groups of carbon and hydrogen atoms to their surface, effectively giving each molecule a set of antlers that allowed them to preserve their native reactivity while keeping their partner at a safe distance – also known as “frustrating” them. “We use frustrated radicals to activate carbon-hydrogen bonds and convert them into other chemical bonds, which can affect the property of the original molecule,” Lin said. “This strategy can thus be used to improve efficacy of drug molecules, for example.” Carbon-hydrogen bonds are ideal candidates for the task because they are commonly found in organic molecules – a carbon molecule, for example, can have upwards of 20 or 30 bonds. They are also quite strong, which is why they are often conscripted into service for pharmaceutical development. At the same time, due to their strength, carbon-hydrogen bonds can be difficult to separate out. And because they are so plentiful, selectively functionalizing individual sites is not easy. Lin’s group collaborated with researchers from the San Francisco-based company Genentech to identify substrate targets that would enable the desired chemical reactions. The team installed large functional groups, such as trimethylsilyl, on the frustrated radicals. “You have this barrel of substituents to make it more hindered,” Lin said. “It is actually a very simple idea. How do you use size to control the reactivity and use them to do something useful?” Once the products were made, the team teased them apart and analyzed the reactivity and selectivity through high-level nuclear magnetic resonance and gas and liquid chromatography. The group’s technique can help medicinal chemists initiate dozens of different chemical transformations for a range of applications, from derivatizing more efficient pharmaceutical products and enhancing their biological activity to tracking how drugs degrade in the human body. Co-authors include postdoctoral researchers Minsoo Ju and Yi Wang; Jonathan Meinhardt ’22; former postdoctoral researcher Jesus Martinez Alvarado; and researchers Elisia Villemure and Jack Terrett from Genentech. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and Genentech.

A Cornell study that revealed commercial eastern common bumblebee hives pose a threat to their wild counterparts has led one major pollination company to quickly adapt the bumblebee hive boxes they ship to growers. The study, which published in February in the Journal of Applied Ecology, showed that brightly colored commercial bumblebee nest boxes attract wild queens, who may be seeking to establish their own nests. When wild queens enter these nest boxes, workers treat them as invaders and kill them, which causes losses of wild hives – and valuable pollinators – in those areas. The study also found that attaching an existing device – called an excluder – to the nest box doorways, was 100% effective at preventing wild queens from entering hives. The company, Plant Products, a North American subsidiary of Biobest, has already provided excluders for the entrances and exits of all hives it ships, along with excluder operating instructions. In addition, a product manager has called every client to explain the use of the excluder, which makes a doorway too small for large queens, but big enough for workers. “For every queen that we’re losing because of this behavior, that’s a whole colony of bumblebees that we’re potentially losing that’s providing really important pollination services later in the season,” said Heather Grab, Ph.D. ’17, senior lecturer in the School of Integrative Plant Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the paper’s corresponding author. Olivia Miller ‘21, who worked on this research as part of her undergraduate thesis, is the paper’s first author. “From what we see in our data, it’s an average of about 10 queens per colony that are being killed, and that’s just in our study region,” she added. The study also found that pollination services actually declined at sites where commercial bumblebee colonies were used, compared to areas where they were not used. The scientists suspect that the drop in services was due to the loss of wild pollinators.  A few months prior to the paper’s publication, co-author Scott McArt, Ph.D. ’12, associate professor of pollinator health in the Department of Entomology (CALS) and manager of the Dyce Lab for Honeybee Studies, contacted Plant Products and Koppert, the only two North American commercial bumblebee suppliers, to tell them about their findings and how excluders offer a simple and effective solution. By the time the paper published in February, Plant Products was already prepared to add excluders to all its shipments. The company has also started research and development to evaluate optimal strategies going forward. “Frankly, I’ve been blown away by how quickly Biobest responded to the study’s findings and implemented simple but effective companywide changes,” McArt said. The excluders were originally developed for a completely different purpose, but came in handy when the Cornell researchers made their discovery. Commercial bumblebee nest boxes come with two openings, which serve as an entrance and an exit for the bees. The openings can be slid shut, so if growers spray their crops, they can close the exit to keep bees in but leave the entrance open for bees out foraging to return. Also, if growers want to move a hive, they can close both openings and reopen them in a new location. Excluders were originally developed to cover just the exit, to prevent commercial hive queens from escaping and mating with wild bees and mixing genes, and/or spreading disease. No one expected they would be needed to keep wild bees out. Now Plant Products is using the excluders on both the entrances. Overall, bumblebees have been experiencing population declines throughout North America, so saving queens early in spring has a high potential to stem some of those declines, McArt added.

Just north of some of the most challenged neighborhoods in Rochester, a small farm is flourishing – and providing more than just food. The half-acre farm, established in 2022 by Cornell Cooperative Extension Monroe County (CCE Monroe), is the site of a workforce training and transitional jobs program for young adults, 18 to 26, who face obstacles in finding or keeping employment. Andre Johnson, left, and Libon Jilane are young adults who participated in a Cornell Cooperative Extension Monroe County work skills development program at its South Lawn Community Garden in Rochester, N.Y. “This is a population that just doesn’t have the opportunities everybody else has, and it’s not fair,” said Marci Muller, horticulture program leader for CCE Monroe and longtime advocate for at-risk young adults. “The purpose of our program is to help them build that workday structure into their life, to develop the soft skills: getting to work on time, being a good team member. When they’re at a point where they can hold on to a job, we help them find work.” Part of CCE Monroe’s South Lawn Project, the GROWS program (Gaining Relevant and Outstanding Work Skills) is in its second year, with cohorts of five young adults moving through the program at a time; by the end of this year’s growing season, 15 employees will have worked on the farm, receiving stipends for their hours. With CCE, partnering nonprofits and agencies help the workers tackle the broader challenges that prevent them from finding and keeping employment, such as housing and financial insecurity or inconsistent access to internet, childcare and transportation. Farm employees gain tangible skills – maintaining the infrastructure of the farm and learning how to grow, tend and harvest the crops – but also begin to imagine new careers for themselves, said Michael Kincaid, urban agriculture educator at CCE Monroe and farm manager for the South Lawn Project. Kincaid and Muller helped current employee Jordan Conyer, 21, find an additional part-time job and enroll in community college for the fall. Conceived as an outdoor classroom, the farm is located on the south lawn of the CCE Monroe offices and, in addition to GROWS, provides opportunities for the community to learn about horticulture, urban farming, nutrition and more. Between 80 and 90 crop varieties are currently growing, and the harvested food is donated back to food pantries in low-income neighborhoods – the first delivery, made the last week of June, consisted of 36 pounds of food. Muller said she would love to expand the program’s footprint and bring urban gardening directly to the communities where Conyer and others live. “Having more of a presence in the city would help a lot, if we could get access to more funding, a vacant lot, and have a mobile crew,” Muller said. “There’s a big push to empower people to grow their own food, to take back property in the city that is not being utilized, to beautify and improve communities. Having a satellite garden in the neighborhoods where our kids live would make a big difference for those communities and for our program.” Some current and past employees have discovered a more direct career interest in horticulture as well. Walker may be on that path – he left the program for two weeks, and when he returned, the change in the garden astounded him. Kincaid said there are many moments where he and the employees recover a childlike curiosity, a sense of joy and surprise. Employees recalled surprises, too: finding weeds that smell like peanut butter, discovering fennel’s black licorice flavor, catching and releasing a groundhog and a baby raccoon.

Ray Jayawardhana, the Harold Tanner Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (A&S), and the Hans Bethe Professor and professor of astronomy, has been named provost of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Jayawardhana’s five-year appointment begins Oct. 15. Rachel Bean, the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor in the Department of Astronomy, and senior associate dean for math and science, has been named interim A&S dean, effective July 13, while the university conducts a national search for Jayawardhana’s successor. Jayawardhana will remain at Cornell and help with the leadership transition until his departure. Previously dean of the Faculty of Science and professor of physics and astronomy at York University in Toronto, Jayawardhana came to Cornell as the 22nd A&S dean on Sept. 1, 2018, succeeding Gretchen Ritter ’83, the college’s first female dean. During his tenure, Jayawardhana has led the recruitment of 131 new tenure-stream faculty members and appointments to 66 endowed professorships. The college has set consecutive fundraising records, with a tally exceeding $95.6 million for fiscal year 2023, and has reached $350 million of its $400 million campaign goal in support of these priorities. Major initiatives launched under Jayawardhana’s leadership include: 1.	the Klarman Fellowships, a postdoctoral program for exceptional emerging researchers, renewed and expanded recently; 2.	the New Frontier Grants for novel research projects with potential for transformative advances; 3.	the Nexus Scholars program, to expand opportunities for undergraduate research with faculty; 4.	the Humanities Scholars Program, a curated and mentored pathway through humanistic inquiry for select students; 5.	the Distinguished Visiting Journalist program, to recognize excellence in journalism while fostering meaningful engagement between the media and the academy; 6.	the Arts Unplugged series of marquee events that bring the campus community and the public together around themes of broad interest; and 7.	the $110 million renewal of the iconic McGraw Hall, the third-oldest building on campus and home to the departments of history and anthropology. Jayawardhana played a pivotal role in establishing the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy and the multi-college departments of sociology and psychology, and expanding the Department of Economics. He also partnered with deans and faculty to formulate and lead three signature initiatives – on climate, artificial intelligence and quantum research. As a researcher, Jayawardhana studies the diversity, origins and evolution of planetary systems, and the formation and evolution of stars. In particular, his group uses the largest telescopes on the ground and in space to do remote-sensing of exoplanets as a way to explore prospects for life in the universe. He is a core science team member for the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope; his group leads a Gemini Observatory large program on high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. “On a deeply personal level,” he said, “it’s gratifying and humbling to have served on the faculty at Carl Sagan’s academic home, and to have held the Hans A. Bethe Professorship.” A native of Sri Lanka, Jayawardhana received his bachelor’s in astronomy and physics from Yale University, and his Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard University.

When you’re shopping online for clothes, it’s so easy to put that $10 T-shirt in your cart and check out without much thought about why it’s only $10 or how well or ethically it was made. Gary Phan ’23 wants to change all that with his company, Sleeve, which helps sustainable boutique and small clothing stores find larger markets for their clearance items or excess inventory. “There are a lot of companies recommending sustainable clothing products, but none that are addressing the affordability question,” he said. “A lot of people are interested in purchasing sustainable fashion, but the barrier is price.” Phan’s company was recently chosen as one of 700 semifinalist teams for the Hult Prize, which challenges young people to solve the world’s most pressing issues through social entrepreneurship. This year’s theme is sustainable fashion, so it was perfect timing for Phan to apply. “It was an amazing experience to see how other countries were innovating on sustainable fashion through textiles and efficient production manufacturing,” said Phan, whose team wasn’t selected as a finalist. “We came to this competition to absorb as much as we could, and left with our pockets full of knowledge, network and friendships.” Phan said that he and friends from home had dreamed of creating their own sustainable clothing brand, “but growing up low-income, we realized that doing something 100 percent sustainable and ethical was so expensive,” said Phan, who transferred to Cornell and is a student in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. “When I came to Cornell, I joined the Social Enterprise Group at Cornell (SEGC), and we came up with this idea for a Chrome extension that could intercept consumers from buying fast fashion and suggest more sustainable alternatives.” Phan’s team, also composed of Serena Huang ‘24 and Ioana Nechiti ‘24, was chosen for eLab last year, and after lots of research and customer discovery, they moved from the Chrome extension idea to an online marketplace. They’re targeting smaller sustainable clothing companies, Phan said, because they have more marketing challenges. The Sleeve site includes 25 brands and Phan said more are ready to be added soon. Sleeve is spreading the word to its target audience of college students and young adults through Instagram, TikTok and email campaigns, as well as social media influencers in the sustainable fashion space. The company is also looking to roll out with ambassador programs to universities by the end of the year. Phan’s team includes students from Cornell, as well as UCLA, USC and Cal State Pomona and Cal State Long Beach, and graduates that have industry experience in sustainable fashion and web development. “I also want to give a huge shoutout to my amazing team, the eLab program, and Nancy Almann from Blackstone Launchpad for being such an amazing backbone and support system throughout our company’s development,” he said. After graduation in December, Phan hopes to work on Sleeve full-time. “I love entrepreneurship. If I can make something and run with it, I definitely will,” he said. “We’re looking for partnerships with sustainable and ethical fashion brands, so if any brands are interested, don’t hesitate to reach out.” As far as Phan’s own fashion sense? “I think I’m a bit more fashionable than I used to be a few years ago,” he said. “But it’s secondary for me. What I really look at is how long I’m going to be able to wear these clothes.”

Filmmakers may soon be able to stabilize shaky video, change viewpoints and create freeze-frame, zoom and slow-motion effects – without shooting any new footage – thanks to an algorithm developed by researchers at Cornell University and Google Research. The software, called DynIBar, synthesizes new views using pixel information from the original video, and even works with moving objects and unstable camerawork. The work is a major advance over previous efforts, which yielded only a few seconds of video, and often rendered moving subjects as blurry or glitchy. The code for this research effort is freely available, though the project is at an early stage and not yet integrated into commercial video editing tools. “While this research is still in its early days, I’m really excited about potential future applications for both personal and professional use,” said Noah Snavely, a research scientist at Google Research and associate professor of computer science at Cornell Tech and in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. “Over the last few years, we’ve seen major progress in view synthesis methods – algorithms that can take a collection of images capturing a scene from a discrete set of viewpoints, and can render new views of that scene,” said Snavely. “However, most of these methods fail on scenes with moving people or pets, swaying trees and so on. This is a big problem because many interesting things in the world are things that move.” Existing methods to render new views of still scenes, such as ones that make a photo appear 3D, take the 2D grid of pixels from an image and reconstruct the 3D shape and appearance of each object in the photo. DynIBar takes this a step further by also estimating how the objects move over time. But considering all four dimensions creates an incredibly difficult math problem. The researchers simplified this problem by using a computer graphics approach developed in the 1990s called image-based rendering. At the time, it was difficult for traditional computer graphics methods to render complex scenes with many small parts –  such as a leafy tree – so graphics researchers developed methods that take images of a scene and then alter and recombine the parts to generate new images. In this way, most of the complexity was stored within the source image and could load faster. “We incorporated the classic idea of image-based rendering and that makes our method able to handle really complex scenes and longer videos,” said co-author Qianqian Wang, a doctoral student in the field of computer science at Cornell Tech. Wang developed a method to use image-based rendering to synthesize new views of still images, which the new software builds on. Despite the advance, these features may not be coming to your smartphone any time soon. The software takes several hours to process just 10 or 20 seconds of video, even on a powerful computer. In the near-term, the technology may be more appropriate for use in offline video editing software, Snavely said. The next hurdle will be figuring out how to render new images when pixel information is lacking from the original video, such as when the subject moves too fast or the user wants to rotate the viewpoint 180 degrees. Snavely and Wang envision that soon it may be possible to incorporate generative AI techniques, such as text-to-image generators, to help fill in those gaps. Forrester Cole and Richard Tucker from Google Research also contributed to the research.

For years, the financial press has helped inform investors of all stripes. Cornell researchers have discovered it can also inform the algorithm behind a new financial predicting model. In their paper, “News-Based Sparse Machine Learning Models for Adaptive Asset Pricing,” published in Data Science in Science in April, the researchers draw from interdisciplinary fields such as machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and finance to build a new, interpretable machine-learning framework that captures stock- and industry-specific information and predicts financial returns with greater accuracy than traditional models. The text helps with “clustering the data,” bringing order to the chaotic results algorithms can produce, said lead author Liao Zhu, Ph.D. ’20, who started working in the finance industry after finishing the paper. “Our hypothesis is that the financial news could do better in helping us better understand what type of stocks are related to certain tradable assets.” The paper is a continuation of Zhu’s previous research that emerged from his early doctoral studies under Wells and Robert Jarrow, the Ronald P. & Susan E. Lynch Professor of Investment Management at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management. Peter (Haoxuan) Wu, Ph.D. ’23 is a co-author of the paper. Applying traditional statistics methods to market data to explain stock returns is not new. Neither is using text data: Investors have used sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing, to mine online text for positive or negative words associated with a company that, in theory, may signal a stock price’s rise or fall. The new research treads new ground by proposing a flexible prediction framework that bridges market data and text data without sentiment analysis, and integrates new, interpretable machine-learning algorithms. The researchers borrow the method of “word embeddings” from natural language processing and use an algorithm to create “asset embeddings” for a specific set of tradable assets from financial news. After converting both text and market data into numbers, the researchers then deploy custom-designed algorithms to crunch the numbers. “Our algorithm is not using the sentiment from the news but using the news as guidance for what assets or words to consider for each specific stock or industry, which reveals more stock- and industry-specific information,” Zhu said. To develop their models, researchers scraped a massive corpus of online financial news articles from 2013 to 2019 and fed it to their algorithm, which began mapping particular assets and words associated with specific stocks and industries. With an AI-optimized language map in hand, researchers had more insight into specific assets and words to consider. Using this method, the team developed two separate models. The News Embedding UMAP Sparse Selection (NEUSS) model predicts returns for individual stocks, and the News Sparse Encoder with Rationale (INSER) model identifies important words for each specific industry before using them to predict industry returns more accurately. For example, the NEUSS model may conclude from the financial news that an exchange-traded fund that tracks the semiconductor manufacturing sector is useful to predict the stock returns of a specific tech company, but may not be useful to predict returns of other stocks in, say, retail or wholesale. The INSER model may pick up the word “plant” as important for the energy industry, but this word may not be relevant for other industries like social media.

Unused solar, wind, and hydroelectric power in the U.S. could support the exponential growth of transactions involving non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cornell Engineering researchers have found. Processing of NFT transactions, which has increased fourfold over the past five years, was once highly energy-intensive but has been made more sustainable with a recent switch to a more energy-efficient algorithm. But those savings, the researchers said, will be largely offset by the anticipated boom in yearly NFT activity. Excess renewable energy, due to lack of storage capability, forces grid operators to curtail production. You’s idea would put that unused energy-production potential to good use. “It’s the same idea as a car sitting in someone’s garage,” You said. “If it’s not being driven, they could lend it to someone for carsharing. In our case, wind, solar and hydro power sources that aren’t being utilized could be used to do something good." “Of course, this would be up to the industry and policymakers,” he said, “but technology-wise, we show it’s very feasible because these power sources are there already.” Their key finding: The increased NFT processing activity could be powered, in part, from un- or underutilized existing power sources. Fifty megawatts of potential hydropower from existing U.S. dams that are not currently used to generate power, or a 15% utilization of wind and solar energy that can’t currently be used or stored from sources in Texas, could be used to power an exponential increase in NFT transactions. Blockchain technologies, including NFT transactions, offer a high level of security in a variety of applications, but the energy required to process each transaction is problematic in a warming world. Without any efforts to make NFT transaction processing more sustainable, the authors wrote, their annual emissions will reach an equivalent of 0.37 megatons of carbon dioxide – close to the CO2 emissions from 1 million single-trip flights for a passenger from New York to London. In September of 2022, the Ethereum blockchain responded to the call for more sustainable trading by switching from an energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) algorithm to a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which requires less computing power. Energy consumption decreased drastically following the switch, known as the Ethereum Merge. Still, the authors wrote, an exponential rise in recorded NFT transactions would translate to more validators operating on the network. Toward the end of this decade, energy consumed by an exponential increase in NFT transactions could be equivalent to that of 100,000 U.S. households. So even with significantly less energy consumption for individual NFT transactions, the cumulative effect of increased numbers of validators operating on fossil fuel-dominant grids will lead to a further rise in the associated carbon debt. “By the end of this decade,” You said, “the carbon produced by NFT transactions may be roughly equivalent to that produced in one year by a 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant.” The authors evaluated two hydroelectric energy carriers – green hydrogen and green ammonia (more energy-dense than hydrogen) – for their viability, noting that their cost savings are influenced by multiple factors, including transportation distances and the utilization levels of available renewable energy sources. Retrofitting these existing power sources could be challenging, the authors said, but would still be good for energy carriers and the planet. “NFT processing is very power-hungry,” You said, “so this turns out to be a good way to take advantage of these curtailments.” This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation.

Humans make lots of irrational decisions in predictable ways, but what if we’re all just doing our best within the limits of our abilities? Researchers were able to simulate human behaviors using a probabilistic finite automaton, a well-known model of limited computational power. They programmed the automatons to compete against each other in a wildlife poaching game, as either a rhino poacher or a ranger trying to stop the poaching. When the automatons could remember everything, they settled into an optimal game strategy. But when researchers limited their memories, they took some decision-making shortcuts – the same kinds as actual humans playing the game. This new work supports the idea of bounded rationality, that “sometimes we do silly things or make systemic mistakes, not because we’re irrational but because we have limited resources,” said first author Xinming Liu ’20. “Oftentimes, we cannot remember everything that happened in the past or we don’t have enough time to make a fully rational decision.” Liu presented the work, “Strategic Play By Resource-Bounded Agents in Security Games,” in May at the 2023 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. The senior author is Joseph Halpern, professor of computer science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. In the poaching game, there are a handful of sites, each with a different probability of containing a rhino. In each round, the poacher and ranger choose a site to visit, making their decisions based on data from previous rounds. The poacher gains points by catching a rhino; the ranger gains points by catching the poacher. In the game, this means the poacher made more visits to sites where they most often encountered rhinos in the past, and fewer visits to sites that rarely had a rhino. For the automatons, this strategy wasn’t ideal, but still yielded decent results. Another irrational human behavior that led to good game performance was overweighting significant results – a phenomenon in which important or traumatic incidents loom especially large in the memory. For example, a person might drive slowly down a stretch of road where they received a speeding ticket many years ago. When the researchers programmed the poachers to overweight previous encounters with the ranger, it paid off in the game. They ended up avoiding sites where the rangers were most likely to be. To see how these results match up to actual humans, Liu recruited approximately 100 people to play as the poacher on an online platform. While some humans chose the same site every time or picked randomly just to finish the game and receive payment, others chose sites purely based on probability matching. A third group assumed the ranger was probability matching, and visited sites accordingly to avoid the ranger. The similarities in gameplay between the humans and automatons show that the model can re-create at least two human behaviors, which, instead of being irrational, actually improved their performance. “Another way to interpret it is to say that you’re doing the best you can given your computational limitations,” Halpern said. “And that strikes me as pretty rational.”

With artificial intelligence poised to assist in profound scientific discoveries that will change the world, Cornell is leading a new $11.3 million center focused on human-AI collaboration that uses mathematics as a common language. The Scientific Artificial Intelligence Center, or SciAI Center, is being launched with a grant from the Office of Naval Research and is led by Christopher J. Earls, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell Engineering. Co-investigators include Nikolaos Bouklas, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell Engineering; Anil Damle, assistant professor of computer science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science; and Alex Townsend, associate professor of mathematics in the College of Arts and Sciences. All of the investigators are field faculty members of the Center for Applied Mathematics. With the advance of AI systems – built with tangled webs of algorithms and trained on increasingly large sets of data – researchers fear AI’s inner workings will provide little insight into its uncanny ability to recognize patterns in data and make scientific predictions. Earls described it as a situation at odds with true scientific discovery. “Scientific theories are explanatory stories that offer mechanistic insights into how the universe works,” Earls said. “These theories offer reasoning behind what has been observed, but also, they predict that which has yet to be observed. Such extrapolatory power is entirely beyond anything standard AI can achieve. Our new center will pioneer radically new AI approaches for scientific discovery.” The SciAI Center will use mathematics as a common language between humans and machines because, Townsend said, math is how scientists have modeled the world for hundreds of years. “Instead of getting AI to predict the future using data from a physical system, we will get AI to speak in the language of calculus and derive the underlying differential equations that govern a physical system,” Townsend said. “We are trying to develop an AI-human collaboration that can become our science teacher, revealing patterns of the natural world.” The SciAI Center will have four intellectual thrusts – scientific data, operator learning, closure models and complex systems. Its three application areas of focus will be materials, turbulence and autonomy. “By blending machine learning techniques with physics-informed algorithms, we can accelerate computational methods to aid in the understanding of materials and molecular systems,” said Damle, who added that Cornell’s fostering of interdisciplinary research makes it a natural home for such a center, enabling researchers from a broad set of areas to contribute. Aside from its research goals, the center will be committed to helping populations underrepresented in science and engineering gain access to emerging AI tools through a series of student pathway programs that prepare young researchers to work in new industries. Other institutions participating include the United States Naval Academy; the University of California, Santa Cruz; the California Institute of Technology; the University of Cambridge; Brown University; the University of California, Berkeley; and Integer Technologies.

Using a combination of high-powered X-rays, phase-retrieval algorithms and machine learning, Cornell researchers revealed the intricate nanotextures in thin-film materials, offering scientists a new, streamlined approach to analyzing potential candidates for quantum computing and microelectronics, among other applications. Scientists are especially interested in nanotextures that are distributed non-uniformly throughout a thin film because they can give the material novel properties. The most effective way to study the nanotextures is to visualize them directly, a challenge that typically requires complex electron microscopy and does not preserve the sample. The new imaging technique detailed July 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesovercomes these challenges by using phase retrieval and machine learning to invert conventionally-collected X-ray diffraction data – such as that produced at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, where data for the study was collected – into real-space visualization of the material at the nanoscale. The use of X-ray diffraction makes the technique more accessible to scientists and allows for imaging a larger portion of the sample, said Andrej Singer, assistant professor of materials science and engineering and David Croll Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow in Cornell Engineering, who led the research with doctoral student Ziming Shao. “Imaging a large area is important because it represents the true state of the material,” Singer said. “The nanotexture measured by a local probe could depend on the choice of the probed spot.” Another advantage of the new method is that it doesn’t require the sample to be broken apart, enabling the dynamic study of thin films, such as introducing light to see how structures evolve. “This method can be readily applied to study dynamics in-situ or operando,” Shao said. “For example, we plan to use the method to study how the structure changes within picoseconds after excitation with short laser pulses, which might enable new concepts for future terahertz technologies.” The technique was tested on two thin films, the first of which had a known nanotexture used to validate the imaging results. Upon testing a second thin film – a Mott insulator with physics associated with superconductivity – the researchers discovered a new type of morphology that had not been observed in the material before – a strain-induced nanopattern that forms spontaneously during cooling to cryogenic temperatures. “The images are extracted without prior knowledge,” Shao said, “potentially setting new benchmarks and informing novel physical hypotheses in phase-field modeling, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations.” Co-authors include the late Lena Kourkoutis, associate professor of applied and engineering physics; Kyle Shen, the James A. Weeks Professor of Physical Sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences; Darrell Schlom, the Herbert Fisk Johnson Professor of Industrial Chemistry and Tisch University Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering; and Hari Nair, assistant research professor of materials science and engineering. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.

Cornell scientists have revealed a new phase of matter in candidate topological superconductors that could have significant consequences for condensed matter physics and for the field of quantum computing and spintronics. Researchers at the Macroscopic Quantum Matter Group at Cornell have discovered and visualized a crystalline yet superconducting state in a new and unusual superconductor, Uranium Ditelluride (UTe2), using one of the world’s most powerful millikelvin Scanned Josephson Tunnelling Microscopes (SJTM). This “spin-triplet electron-pair crystal” is a previously unknown state of topological quantum matter. The findings, “Detection of a Pair Density Wave State in UTe2,” were published June 28 in Nature. Qiangqiang Gu, a postdoctoral researcher working in the lab of physicist J.C. Séamus Davis, the James Gilbert White Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the College of Arts and Sciences, co-led the research with Joe Carroll of University College Cork and Shuqiu Wang of Oxford University. Superconductors are topological when the pairing potential exhibits odd parity, leading to each electron pair adopting a spin-triplet state, with both electron spins oriented in the same direction. Topological superconductors are the target of intense research by physicists because they can, in theory, form the materials platform for ultra-stable quantum computers, said Gu. However, even after a decade of intense investigation into topological superconductivity, no bulk materials have been definitively recognized as spin-triplet, odd-parity superconductors, with the exception of superfluid 3He, which was also discovered at Cornell. Recently, the exotic new material Uranium Ditelluride (UTe2) has emerged as a highly promising candidate for this classification. However, its superconductive order parameter remains elusive, said Gu. In 2021, theoretical physicists began to propose that UTe2 is actually in a topological pair-density-wave (PDW) state. No such form of quantum matter had ever been detected. In simple terms, a PDW is like a stationary dance of the paired electrons found in a superconductor, but the pairs form periodic crystalline patterns in space. “Our team at Cornell discovered the first PDW ever observed in 2016 using the superconductive-tip Scanned Josephson Tunnelling Microscope that we invented for that purpose,” said Gu. “Since then, we have pioneered SJTM studies at millikelvin temperatures and with microvolt energy resolution. For the UTe2 project, we have directly visualized the spatial modulations of the superconducting pairing potential at atomic scale and found them to modulate exactly as predicted in a PDW state as the density of electron pairs modulates periodically in space. What we detected is a new quantum matter state – a topological pair density wave composed of spin-triplet Cooper pairs.” Cooper-pair density waves are a form of electronic quantum matter in which pairs of electrons freeze into a superconductive PDW state, instead of forming a conventional “superconductive” fluid where all are in the same freely moving state. “The discovery of the first PDW in spin-triplet superconductors is exciting,” said Gu. “Uranium-based heavy fermion superconducting compounds are a new and exotic class of materials that provide a promising platform for realisation of topological superconductivity. … Our scientific discovery also points out the ubiquitous nature of this intriguing quantum state in s-wave, d-wave and p-wave superconductors, and it sheds light on new avenues for identifying such states in a broad spectrum of materials.”

Using a deep learning computer model and a dataset containing millions of dashboard camera images from New York City rideshare drivers, Cornell Tech researchers were able to see which neighborhoods had the highest numbers of New York Police Department marked vehicles, a possible indication of deployment patterns. Their results showed trends in police presence by time of day, neighborhood demographics, proximity to police stations and commercial districts. Among the researchers’ findings: Gramercy Park, in Midtown Manhattan, had the most police vehicles visible in dashcam images -- almost 20 times more than Arden Heights/Rossville, in southern Staten Island, which had the fewest. Areas with more police vehicle images included wealthy commercial zones and low-income neighborhoods with higher proportions of Black and Latino residents. Senior authors are Wendy Ju, associate professor of information science at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech, and Emma Pierson, assistant professor of computer science at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech. Both are field members in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. While data on police stops, use of force, searches, criminal incidents and arrests is publicly available, police generally do not provide information on how and where officers are deployed, citing security concerns. Deployment disparities, the researchers wrote, can result in downstream biases like increased arrests: A neighborhood that’s more heavily policed than another might not necessarily have more crime, just more people arrested for it.  In 2020, the team – which included J.D. Zamfirescu-Pereira, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley – obtained 24.8 million dashcam images from Nexar, a company that provides rideshare drivers with dashboard cameras. Uber, for example, recommends that their drivers install cameras for their own protection. Nexar made their proprietary images (taken between March 4, 2020, and Nov. 15, 2020) available for research purposes; originally, the Cornell team used it to gather information on how people in New York City were socially distancing during the pandemic. The researchers then used thousands of images, annotated for whether they contained a police car, to train a deep learning model to identify marked police vehicles. While the model could identify police vehicles, it could not account for the reasons they were there. The researchers identified more than 233,000 images containing marked police vehicles. The pictures were taken across all five boroughs, at all times of day. The team then studied the geo-tagged images in context of specific factors such as neighborhood, borough and zone type, and whether the pictures were taken in a bustling commercial area, near manufacturing or in a primary residential location. They also analyzed the images in relation to census data for the area, such as population density, median household income, and the racial makeup of residents (white, Black, Hispanic, Asian). The researchers said they see two main benefits to this work: a step toward greater transparency in policing; and the potential for auditing all government agencies for efficiency and equity. Ju said researchers could apply this method of training a model to identify objects – such as garbage piles -- with computer vision in myriad ways that help city governments and urban planners. It’s the ability of this method to adapt to detect a wide variety of phenomena – in this case, marked police vehicles – that is most exciting to Ju. Support for this work came from an Amazon Research Award, a Google Research Scholar Award and the National Science Foundation.

Weill Cornell Medicine and Columbia University have been awarded a five-year, $9.8 million grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, to help combat cancer disparities fueled by persistent poverty. The award will engage faculty members from Weill Cornell Medicine, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University School of Nursing and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in a collaborative effort to develop a specialized research center and spearhead two large projects in four communities of persistent poverty in New York City. “The NCI wanted to fund centers that came up with novel, creative, innovative ways to close health equity gaps,” Tamimi said. “While we’re not able to eliminate persistent poverty, we can mitigate some of its influences on cancer.” The overall center will be led by a multi-principal investigator team that includes Dr. Erica Phillips from Weill Cornell Medicine, and Mary Beth Terry and Phoenix Matthews at Columbia. “This initiative continues important collaborations across Columbia and Weill Cornell Medicine related to public health initiatives to reduce the cancer burden, which is crucial given that cancer remains the No. 1 reason for premature mortality in New York City,” said Terry, a professor of epidemiology from the Columbia Mailman School and a member of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center. Weill Cornell Medicine’s Center for Social Capital (SoCa) will use the grant to tackle two complementary projects promoting multi-generational cancer awareness and health in South Bronx, North-Central Brooklyn, Washington Heights and Western Queens, working with many community partners. The first project, led by Phillips, will test the effectiveness of a six-week cancer education and social justice curriculum among middle school students at 10 New York City public schools. The curriculum, delivered by the schools’ primary science teachers, will explore cancer prevention and control from six distinct vantage points: social justice; media literacy and tobacco advertising; nutrition; cancer genetics; biotech; and risk reduction. The work will be conducted collaboratively with Columbia investigators, along with the national nonprofit Math for America, which strives to enhance science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) instruction in NYC public schools. “We also know that poverty is multi-generational and is linked to unemployment,” Phillips added. “We know the future is in STEM careers, so this project is also about enhancing the exposure kids receive to STEM-based careers so that they can be gainfully employed and leaders down the line.” The second project, led by Matthews, from Columbia’s School of Nursing, will implement an innovative tobacco cessation trial using federally qualified health centers and patient portal technology. The team will work directly with safety-net health care clinics to increase patient awareness of free smoking cessation treatments offered by the New York State Tobacco Quitline. Investigators will use an established patient portal to directly communicate with patients about changes they make to their smoking behaviors. “Addressing smoking and smoking-related health inequalities among patients from economically disadvantaged backgrounds remains an important public health priority,” said Matthews, a professor of behavioral sciences (in nursing) and a member of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center. “Low-income patients encounter numerous barriers to accessing affordable and effective smoking cessation treatments. This approach will build the capacity of safety-net clinics to support providers in increasing patient access to evidence-based smoking cessation counseling in a way that minimizes costs and provider burden.” Additionally, the team will develop a capacity-building program that accelerates pre-faculty investigators who are committed to cancer health disparities in impoverished communities to attain research funding and strengthening their position for academic promotion.

At the center the Earth is a solid metal ball, a kind of “planet within a planet,” whose existence makes life on the surface possible, at least as we know it. How Earth’s inner core formed, grew and evolved over time remains a mystery, one that a team of researchers is seeking to plumb with the help of seismic waves from naturally occurring earthquakes. While this 2,442-kilometer-diameter sphere comprises less than 1% of the Earth’s total volume, its existence is responsible for the planet’s magnetic field, without which Earth would be a much different place. The inner core is not the homogenous mass that was once assumed by scientists, but rather it’s more like a tapestry of different “fabric,” according to Guanning Pang, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Cornell Engineering. “For the first time we confirmed that this kind of inhomogeneity is everywhere inside the inner core,” said Pang, who is the lead author of a new study published July 5 in Nature that opens a window into the deepest reaches of Earth. He conducted the research as part of his Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Utah. While Earth’s surface has been thoroughly mapped and characterized, its interior is much harder to study since it cannot be directly accessed. The best tools for sensing this hidden realm are earthquakes’ seismic waves propagating from the planet’s thin crust and vibrating through its rocky mantle and metallic core. “The planet formed from asteroids that were sort of accreting [in space]. They’re running into each other and you generate a lot of energy. So the whole planet, when it’s forming up, is melting,” Koper said. “It’s simply that the iron is heavier and you get what we call core formation. The metals sink to the middle, and the liquid rock is outside, and then it essentially freezes over time. The reason all the metals are down there is because they’re heavier than the rocks.” The protective field of magnetic energy surrounding Earth is created by convection occurring within the liquid outer core, which extends 2,260 kilometers (1,795 miles) above the solid core, he said. The molten metal rises above the solid inner core, cools as it approaches Earth’s rocky mantle and sinks. This circulation generates the bands of electrons enveloping the planet. Without Earth’s solid inner core, this field would be much weaker and the planetary surface would be bombarded with radiation and solar winds that would strip away the atmosphere and render the surface uninhabitable. For the new study, the Pang and Koper looked at seismic data recorded by 20 arrays of seismometers placed around the world including two in Antarctica. The closest to Utah is outside Pinedale, Wyo. These instruments are inserted in boreholes drilled up to 10 meters into granite formations and arranged in patterns to concentrate the signals they receive, similar to the way parabolic antennae work. Pang analyzed seismic waves from 2,455 earthquakes, all exceeding magnitude 5.7. The way these waves bounced off the inner core help map its internal structure. Smaller quakes do not generate waves strong enough to be useful for the study. Scientists first used seismic waves to determine that the inner core was solid in 1936. Before the discovery by Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann, it was assumed the entire core was liquid since it is exceedingly hot, approaching 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, about the temperature on the sun’s surface. Participating in the study, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, were researchers from University of Southern California, the Université de Nantes in France, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

An atlas that catalogues gene activity and the levels of small molecules called metabolites in tumor samples offers a new way of identifying the deep mechanisms of cancer, according to researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The researchers, who published their work June 19 in Nature Metabolism, created the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles (CAMP) by combining new and existing datasets on metabolites and gene activity. The atlas contains data from 988 tumor and normal-tissue control samples across 11 different cancer types. The scientists’ analysis of the data revealed two broad classes of gene-metabolite connections that point to mechanisms at work across cancer types. “This new atlas will help us build a core understanding of how tumors function,” said study co-senior author Jan Krumsiek, assistant professor of physiology and biophysics and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine. The pattern of metabolite levels in tissues is one of the important layers of information in biology, and researchers already know that key events in cancer, such as tumor development and the acquisition of drug resistance, are accompanied by significant changes in metabolites. Relating these cancer-associated metabolite changes to changes in gene activity helps scientists understand why these metabolite changes occur – for example, which enzymes or other proteins are driving the changes. In some cases, disrupting those mechanisms could help fight the cancer. The CAMP database the scientists created is meant facilitate such analyses, for it is the largest-ever harmonized collection of data on metabolite and gene-activity levels in primary tumor samples. Putting it together was a serious challenge, though. “The methods used in studies of metabolites have been much less standardized than the methods in, say, RNA sequencing studies,” Krumsiek said. “It’s often the case that two different cancer metabolite studies won’t measure the same set of metabolites, and even the metabolites that are measured in both studies will sometimes have different names in the datasets.” Having painstakingly aligned the disparate features of the individual datasets, the scientists sought clues to broad cancer mechanisms by looking for gene-metabolite relationships that were prominent across all cancer types covered in the database. One pattern they found was expected: Some metabolites were strongly correlated with genes encoding enzymes and other proteins with roles in producing metabolites or otherwise regulating their levels. Identifying genes that control cancer-associated metabolite levels can help in further investigations of these metabolites’ possible roles in driving cancer, Krumsiek said. In the other prominent pattern the team discovered, some metabolites were strongly linked to the activities of broad sets of genes – genes not clearly related to metabolite production and processing. Looking closely at the genes involved, Krumsiek and Reznik realized that this pattern likely reflected the presence of immune cells, which commonly infiltrate solid tumors. The results underscore the importance of understanding the contributions of different cell types in tumor samples, he added. To that end, he and Reznik and their teams now plan to move to more advanced techniques that can “map” gene activity and metabolite levels at precise locations across tumor samples. Many Weill Cornell Medicine physicians and scientists maintain relationships and collaborate with external organizations to foster scientific innovation and provide expert guidance. The institution makes these disclosures public to ensure transparency. For this information, see profile for Dr. Krumsiek.

Young people on social media may be posing for their friends – but potential employers and others who could impact their professional lives are viewing these posts, too. In a new study by Cornell psychology researchers, female applicants for scholarships or jobs were viewed less favorably than males when study participants, acting as decision-makers, were shown “sexy” social media photos of the applicants. This points to a “sexual double standard,” in keeping with conventional sexual and gender norms that assume men’s sexual assertiveness and dominance is a sign of strength, while women are perceived more negatively when exhibiting the same behavior, the researchers said. Zayas said it puts young people – perhaps still in college, or just having entered the job market and looking to advance – in a potential catch-22. “You’re thinking about professional and academic outcomes, but you’re also thinking a lot about social outcomes,” she said. “And when you’re using social media, you’re thinking about it in the context of communicating to your friends. And because that’s so salient, it’s really easy to post photos that you don’t realize might have negative effects on other domains. “Women are more likely to post photos than men,” she said. “That is one way women might want to try to get validated, but at the same time, there’s a potential penalty.” More than 4 billion people have social media accounts, and increasingly, professional recruiters and hiring managers are researching these sites to glean as much information as possible about prospective hires. According to a 2018 national survey, 70% of recruiters indicated that they’d used social media sites to research job candidates; of those recruiters, more than half said they’d found content that made them decide to not hire someone. Zayas and Ni developed four separate experiments: two (studies 1a and 1b) using college-age participants as scholarship recipient decision-makers; and two (studies 2 and 3) using older people with actual hiring experience acting as job recruiters. In the first two experiments (the first in the U.S., the second in China to test the effect in another culture), participants were asked to decide who among two finalists would receive a merit-based scholarship. Both finalists purportedly passed initial assessments and are comparable in terms of qualifications. Participants in both studies were shown two sets of photos – the first depicting a man and a woman in semi-professional attire, the second depicting a man and a woman in sexualized attire. In both cases, the woman was deemed preferable in the semi-professional images (in the U.S. trial by a 4-to-1 margin), but far less so in the sexualized images. In the Chinese study, three times as many sexualized men were chosen over women. For studies 2 and 3, participants were hiring professionals between the ages of 30 and 50, split nearly evenly by gender, and in both studies were asked to evaluate and select candidates for a junior consultant position for their company. In study 2, participants were shown sexy images and one of three other options: semi-professional; eating; or exercising. Again, participants heavily favored the female candidate when depicted in the semi-professional or other settings (approximately 5 to 1), but not in the self-sexualized setting (nearly 2-to-1 men). For study 3, study participants were randomly assigned either the semi-professional or self-sexualized image and provided with a job description and CVs of the candidates. Participants favored the female candidate (3-to-1) in the semi-professional setting, but the male (53% to 47%) in the sexualized setting. Zayas said the preference of women over men in the semi-professional context was not surprising. “That’s consistent with past work, and it was interesting to see the robustness of that effect across all the studies,” she said. “But then there’s a complete reversal when the sexy social media photos were made available.” Support for this work came from Cornell and from the National Science Foundation.

Steven Jackson believes a university should be, first and foremost, about educating students, and that core belief will inspire him in his new role as vice provost for academic innovation (VPAI). “My interest in the position really came from my central commitment as a teacher at Cornell,” said Jackson, professor in the Department of Information Science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, with a dual appointment in the Department of Science and Technology Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences (A&S). “Teaching is at the center of what we do,” Jackson said. “For me, teaching and research go together; they are very tightly intertwined.” Jackson’s term officially begins July 1, although he’s been conducting meetings and easing into the role for several weeks, he said. “Steve is passionate about his teaching and helping students realize their full potential through his work, both in the classroom and in the lab,” Provost Michael I. Kotlikoff said. “He is also a conscientious university citizen whose commitment to continually improving Cornell’s teaching and learning environment for students and faculty makes him an ideal fit for this role.” The position, created in 2017 along with the Center for Teaching Innovation, was initially held by Julia Thom-Levy, professor of physics (A&S) and associate vice provost for physical sciences. John Siliciano ’75, professor of law in Cornell Law School and former deputy provost, has been in the role on an interim basis since October 2022. “I also want to thank Julia for her dedication in five years as our inaugural VPAI, as well as John for stepping in on an interim basis,” Kotlikoff said. “So much has been accomplished since the center was launched and Julia’s leadership and vision have helped keep Cornell at the forefront of pedagogical innovation.” While some people might equate innovation with technology, Jackson said, that’s only part of the story. “Technology is a tool, to be sure, but for me, innovation in teaching is really about inviting and empowering a group of committed teachers to use their imagination, their creativity and the tools around them to think and do teaching in a different way,” said Jackson, whose fields of study include technology ethics, law and policy, and human-computer interaction, including the study of how users and groups collaborate around new computational tools and infrastructures. “And we should invite students to also engage in that process and be part of the ways in which we reinvent and reimagine teaching at Cornell.” Jackson, formerly the chair of information science – as well as house professor-dean of Keeton House on West Campus from 2015-21 – hopes to engage faculty and students and do “a lot of listening” as he grows into his new role. “The diversity and range of teaching that goes on at Cornell has become increasingly apparent to me. There is not a one-size-fits-all approach,” he said. “There are deep disciplinary traditions of teaching, and exciting examples of innovation and experiment that have been going on for decades. “There’s also no one-size-fits-all when it comes to students, who aren’t just blank slates or empty vessels waiting to be filled,” he said. “Our students are coming from all kinds of backgrounds and perspectives, and it’s incumbent on us to bring this in as a resource and opportunity for learning.” Jackson received his bachelor’s in English and creative writing in 1994 from Concordia University in Montreal; his master’s in political economy in 1999 from Carleton University in Ottawa; and his Ph.D. in communication and science studies in 2005 from the University of California, San Diego. He spent six years on the faculty at the University of Michigan before joining Cornell in 2011.

A 15-year collaboration in which Cornell astrophysicists have played leading roles has found the first evidence of gravitational waves slowly undulating through the galaxy, ripples in space-time likely generated by pairs of supermassive black holes in the process of merging. The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center had previously reported hints of the low-frequency waves predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, but said the signal was too faint to confirm their existence. In research published June 28 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the team of nearly 200 scientists and 80 partner institutions said its 15 years of observations with radio telescopes and a collection of cosmic clocks – rapidly spinning pulsars – now provided compelling evidence of gravitational waves with oscillations lasting years to decades. The National Science Foundation’s 305-meter diameter Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico, which collapsed in 2020, was for decades the largest and most sensitive radio telescope in the world, and accounted for about half of NANOGrav’s gravitational wave sensitivity. The detection and ongoing measurements are expected to advance understanding of the universe’s evolution on large and small scales, from insights about how often galaxies collide and what drives black holes to merge, to the fundamental nature of gravity, according to Cornell experts. The newly detected gravitational waves differ from the fleeting, high-frequency ones detected in 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which were created by the collision of black holes 30 times as massive as the sun. In contrast, the low-frequency waves are thought to be generated by orbiting pairs of the universe’s most massive black holes – millions or billions of times more massive than the sun, with sizes larger than the distance between Earth and the sun. Supported by the National Science Foundation, NANOGrav collected data with the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico – which Cornell operated for decades, prior to its collapse in 2020 – Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. The ground-based observatories measured pulses of radio waves generated by a network of 68 pulsars located within a few thousand light years of Earth. Spinning hundreds of times per second, the so-called millisecond pulsars, which are ultra-dense remnants of massive stars, emit beams of radio waves at highly precise intervals, like a lighthouse beacon. “Millisecond pulsars are wonderful not only because they’re inherently exciting astrophysical objects, but also because they’re great tools for studying physics in areas ranging from gravitational waves to the behavior of the supranuclear-density matter in neutron star cores,” said Thankful Cromartie, a NASA Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow at CCAPS and chair of NANOGrav’s pulsar timing working group, which played a lead role in producing the 15-year data set. “It’s amazing that we can account for each and every pulse from an object rotating hundreds of times a second and obtain a measurement approaching atomic-clock precision.” The NANOGrav collaboration has found the first evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves permeating the cosmos. The finding was made possible with 15 years of pulsar observations that turned the Milky Way into a galaxy-sized gravitational wave detector. Gravitational waves stretch and compress the space between the pulsars and Earth, causing the beams to arrive at a telescope slightly earlier or later, according to NANOGrav. The researchers said correlations in timing deviations between pulsars were consistent with predicted gravitational waves. The waves did not originate from a single source, but were detected as a background “hum” – like overlapping voices in a crowd or instruments in an orchestra. As measurements continue to improve, the project expects to identify individual pairs of supermassive black holes for investigation, akin to picking out notes from a cosmic orchestra. “Even though it’s taken 15-plus years,” Cordes said, “this announcement is really just the beginning.” Additional Cornellians working on NANOGrav include Stella Ocker, Ph.D. ’23, and Sashabaw Niedbalski, a doctoral student in the field of astronomy, and more than a dozen former undergraduates, doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers.

Digital Catapult, the UK authority on advanced digital technology, and Sony Music UK, have announced a cohort of 10 pioneering digital-first startups, to participate in the inaugural FutureScope Black Founders Programme. The programme will look to level the playing field for Black British entrepreneurs in the digital entertainment space and support the successful commercialisation of their innovative new solutions. The announcement marks the beginning of the 16-week programme of activities that will provide each early-stage company with business and investment readiness support, drawing on Digital Catapult’s decade of experience supporting UK startups. Through mentorship, workshops and masterclasses, the programme will look to help each startup raise investment in the next six to nine months, helping to redress a racial imbalance in the UK’s startup and investment landscape. In addition, half of the cohort businesses are led by women and half led by men. Using advanced digital technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence/machine learning, virtual and/or augmented reality, the cohort provides wide-reaching solutions for art, music, social media, retail and tourism. From a digital fine art gallery made possible by an extended reality (XR) immersive world, to an AI-powered social media platform designed to build a community of music lovers, the innovations at the centre of each business are created to transform the UK’s digital entertainment space and bring the sector into a new era. Digital Catapult will deliver the FutureScope Black Founders Programme in partnership with Sony Music UK, with both partners having a long-standing tradition of promoting innovation within the UK’s creative industries. By focusing support toward Black tech entrepreneurs, the programme aims to level the playing field for the participating companies, providing them with knowledge and connections that can lead to future investment opportunities. FutureScope aims to make it easier for Black founders to raise venture capital and successfully scale their solutions, given that research from Atomico, an international investment firm, found that 62% of Black founders have found it increasingly hard to raise venture capital, with only 38 Black founders receiving venture capital funding between 2009 and 2019, just 0.24% of the total sum invested. To offset costs to a business by participating in the programme, each startup will receive £3,000 as a financial contribution towards completing the programme. This also includes additional support from ‘Musiio by SoundCloud’. To ensure long-lasting, positive impact is made for the founders and the UK Black tech community, the programme is further bolstered by support from expert consultants and mentors from across the entertainment and tech industries. This includes Sony Music UK and Soundcloud, and nine purpose-driven organisations that promote Black businesses and inclusive opportunities across the UK’s tech startup community.

During the month of June, people in different parts of the world celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community with pride and raise awareness of the ongoing pursuit of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and other people who identify within the spectrum. This year we’re embracing the theme “Pride and Joy.” At Sony Music Group (SMG), we believe that when everyone belongs, creativity is amplified. We’re committed to promoting a fair and consciously inclusive workplace for all genders and will continue to support initiatives designed to advance the LGBTQIA+ community. That’s why, throughout Pride Month, we celebrated LGBTQIA+ representation through various internal events that empowered LGBTQIA+ team members to lead with impact—authentically. Celebrating the LGBTQIA+ Community With Pride and Joy SMG’s Talent Advisory Groups (TAGs) OutLoud and The Village kicked off our Pride Month activities by hosting a virtual conversation with Anne Sutkowi-Hemstreet, the founder and director of Rainbow Collective for Change (RCC), an organization aimed at supporting LGBTQIA+ and gender-inclusive families. Throughout the event, Sutkowi-Hemstreet detailed various ways families can foster LGBTQIA+ friendly environments for children through educating oneself on gender stereotypes, the importance of gender inclusion, and championing for advocacy organizations including ACLU and the Human Rights Campaign. SMG team members participated with their local communities to show up and show out for Pride from the East Coast to the West Coast. Beginning in Culver City, CA, members took to the streets to march at the 53rd annual Los Angeles Pride Parade, alongside their peers at Sony Pictures Entertainment. In Nashville, TN, they showed off their pride and joy together at the 2023 Nashville Pride Parade. Our celebrations continued in our New York City office with OutLoud’s annual Pride Month Party, where teammates gathered to celebrate with food, drinks, giveaways and a special performance by Columbia Records artist, INIKO. A huge thank you to Sutkowi-Hemstreet, INIKO and SAGE—the world’s largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQIA+ elders—for joining us for our Pride and Joy celebrations. And a big round of applause to OutLoud and The Village for contributing to this month’s events and activities. Thank you for making this Pride Month a joyful celebration of LGBTQIA+ inclusion, representation and empowerment. Supporting of LGBTQIA+ Community Beyond Pride Month Though Pride Month is coming to a close, SMG’s efforts to support the LGBTQIA+ community grow every day, all year round. Through our Global Social Justice Fund, our support continues with aiding various LGBTQIA+ advocacy organizations, including those listed below: 1.	National Black Justice Coalition: NBJC’s mission is to end racism, homophobia, and LGBTQIA+/SGL bias and stigma. NBJC supports Black individuals, families, and communities in strengthening the bonds and bridging the gaps between the movements for racial justice and LGBTQIA+/SGL equity. 2.	Marsha P. Johnson Institute: The Marsha P. Johnson Institute (MPJI) protects and defends the human rights of BLACK transgender people. We do this by organizing, advocating, creating an intentional community to heal, developing transformative leadership, and promoting our collective power. 3.

Sony Music France and joint venture partner KMS announced the launch of co-production ‘Central Tour in Cinema’: a film showcasing iconic French rock band Indochine’s 40th anniversary concert, held in the spring of 2022 to a sold-out and record-setting audience of more than 400,000 fans in five of France’s biggest stadiums. Sony Music France has supported Indochine since the band was first formed. Founded in 1981 Indochine quickly became a national and global success with songs like “L’aventurier” and “Canary Bay”. Four decades on, and several generations of fans later, Indochine has sold 13 million of albums  worldwide, with plans for more collaborations to come. Captured with 22 IMAX certified cameras, the launch of Central Tour in Cinema means Indochine are the first band ever to offer a concert filmed and broadcasted with IMAX technology and screened in cinemas in nine countries around the world. Thanks to the technology of IMAX certified digital cameras and state-of-the-art post-production work, the brightness, colorimetry and contrast are enhanced for unparalleled results of realism and precision on the big screen. The sound, powerful and vibrant, is customized for an optimal spread. The scale of the IMAX screens guarantees a total immersive experience that rivals the spectacular live show. Through the “Filmed for IMAX” program, IMAX cameras must be associated with the unique IMAX postproduction process. Among the first films in the new “Filmed for IMAX” program are Dune, Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, and Top Gun: Maverick – and now Indochine’s Central Tour In Cinema. “We are very proud that the IMAX system has chosen us to be the firsts,” said Nicola Sirkis, Founder of Indochine and KMS. “This system offers a full immersive experience, a way to be as close as possible to us in our show. The image quality is insane. We have literally never seen a concert filmed like that.” “Indochine are simply iconic in my eyes,” said Marie-Anne Robert, Managing Director, Sony Music France. “They’re the gold standard of innovation. They’re constantly changing things up, stepping out of their comfort zone, and giving us things we’ve never seen before. And not only that: they’re icons in the unconditional respect they have for their fans. All the teams here at Sony Music France are so proud to have Indochine on our roster, and we can’t wait to help the band build new projects like this one.” “IMAX continues to be a global destination for fandom of all kinds, and Indochine is a perfect example of how we’re creating unique and immersive entertainment events on the international stage,” added Megan Colligan, President of IMAX Entertainment.

A number of Loretta’s fellow and sister musicians, friends and artists inspired and influenced by her music (including Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, Reba McEntire, Carrie Underwood, Maren Morris, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, Brandi Carlile, Carole King, Martina McBride, Tanya Tucker, Ashley McBryde and others) have lensed a special birthday greetings video.  The video is being hosted on the artist’s website (Loretta Lynn) where fans can sign a birthday card for Loretta, and will be viewable on Loretta’s Facebook and Instagram. To mark the occasion, SME is dedicating a blossoming magnolia tree to Loretta. Located outside the Frist Learning Center on the Cheekwood Estate & Gardens grounds in Nashville, Tennessee, the tree bears a bronze tribute plaque with the inscription: “Loretta Lynn (b. April 14, 1932) / Coal Miner’s Daughter / Music Icon / Celebrating Her 90th Birthday.” Cheekwood is a 55-acre botanical garden and art museum located on the historic Cheek estate, an historical landmark where beauty and excellence in art and horticulture nurture the spirit and serve as inspiration for a diverse and broad audience. “For generations of fans, Loretta Lynn is the heart and soul of American country music, the woman who showed us the untapped possibilities of the genre through the genius and direct perspectives of her songs and the integrity of her performances,” said Richard Story, President, Commercial Music Group, SME. “Please join me and everyone in the Sony family in wishing Loretta the happiest of birthdays along with a deep appreciation for all the magic, truth and beauty she’s shown us through her music over the years.” Loretta is donating effects from her personal archives to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. Among the artifacts are: a 1960s yellow gingham dress sewn by Lynn and a photograph of Loretta wearing the dress while signing autographs; the red gown designed by Loretta’s longtime dressmaker Tim Cobb and worn by Loretta as an honoree at the 26th Kennedy Center Honors in 2003; Loretta’s original handwritten lyrics to “Fist City,” her controversial 1968 Billboard #1 Hot Country Single; first edition copies of her autobiographies–“Coal Miner’s Daughter” (1976) and “Still Woman Enough” (2002)–and more. “As a little girl, I could never have imagined that I’d write books and wear dresses that would wind up in the Smithsonian. These are the kinds of things that make me realize what an amazing life I’ve been given and grateful for what I’m able to share with the world,” said Loretta. The artist is celebrating her birthday with friends and family and sends heartfelt greetings to her fans “I am getting so many big birthday wishes!” Loretta exclaimed. “Thank you, friends, for thinking of me. I’m so happy I get to spend a little more time with you all. My family and I are planning a big dinner and, of course, cake! I love you!”

Shopify is known for helping high-growth brands disrupt the status quo, setting conversion records, and offering the world’s best checkout. Enterprise retailers want access to this innovation too—which is why we’ve made our technology available to the biggest brands on the planet. Shopify already powers household names like Glossier, Alo Yoga, Figs and Staples, and earlier this year, we launched Commerce Components by Shopify, giving more enterprise retailers access to the same Shopify components that power 10% of ecommerce in the U.S. Shopify keeps these retailers on the cutting edge by letting them tap into our unmatched scale while also picking the components they need to build world-class customer experiences. In response to strong demand from enterprise retailers tracking the success and scale of the Shop Pay buyer network, we are opening access to our accelerated checkout to the biggest brands, even if they’re not on Shopify. By turning Shop Pay into a commerce component, we’re enabling enterprise customers to upgrade their customer experience without having to rip and replace all of their commerce infrastructure. For enterprises based in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, that’s easy access to a trusted accelerated checkout with more than 100 million high-intent, high-value buyers. Available through Shopify Payments, Shop Pay boosts conversion by as much as 50% compared to a guest checkout, outpacing all other accelerated checkouts by at least 10%, according to a recent study by one of the Big Three consulting firms. In fact, the data shows that the mere presence of Shop Pay, even when it isn't used by a buyer, results in higher conversion by 5%. “Enterprises that don’t take advantage of Shop Pay are self-sabotaging. They are leaving money on the table,” said Kaz Nejatian, VP Product and Chief Operating Officer of Shopify. “This is critical optionality in a hyper competitive retail environment. In an economy where big brands are competing more fiercely than ever to acquire customers, they need to pick and choose what they need to boost the top-line, without the compromise of a complete platform overhaul.” Why is Shop Pay so powerful? We’ve been able to build the world’s best-converting checkout because of four key advantages: Shopify’s massive identity network, unmatched scale, consumer trust, and velocity of innovation. When someone with a Shop Pay account visits an online store, Shopify recognizes them with one click. If they’ve used Shop Pay recently, our checkout can recognize most customers without any user action. That means Shop Pay can pre-fill all their information for a seamless one-click checkout—leading to a 4x faster experience than a guest checkout. For enterprise retailers, choice matters. Different businesses have different payment requirements, and that’s why Shopify currently offers 1,000+ payment gateways. Adyen has been one of those gateways for years —and now we’re leveling up our integration specifically for enterprise retailers. Adyen makes it easy to accept a wide variety of payments in markets around the world, including credit cards, wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, international payment methods like iDEAL in the Netherlands and Cartes Bancaires in France, and more. This integration is expected to roll out later this year.

We are changing the shape of Shopify significantly today to pay unshared attention to our mission. There are a number of consequences to this, and I don’t want to bury the lede: after today Shopify will be smaller by about 20% and Flexport will buy Shopify Logistics; this means some of you will leave Shopify today. I recognize the crushing impact this decision has on some of you, and did not make this decision lightly. In the next 5 minutes you’ll get a follow up that tells you if you are affected. There’s no way to make this good news, but we designed a package that will attempt to make it the best possible version of a bad day. I've included details below on how we will support you. Our main quests Shopify finds it useful to talk about the difference between main quests and side quests internally. The main quest of the company is its mission, the reason for the company to exist. Side quests are everything else. Side quests are always distracting because the company has to split focus. Sometimes this can be worth it, especially when engaging the side quest creates the conditions by which the main quest can become more successful. In the beginning, as a small startup, companies are intensely focused. It’s often said that larger companies are more sluggish but this is not because of their size, it's because of all the side quests and distractions they accumulate along the way. This happens because larger companies can afford to be somewhat inefficient, especially during stable economic boom times. But once they need to adapt to some new paradigm they can’t. They will get replaced by more focused competitors, or collapse outright. For the past year we’ve been subtracting everything that’s in the way of making the best possible product. This is extremely important, because we are heading into a decade of high velocity and massive change. We will require speed, agility, and a great deal of innovation. Shopify’s main quest is to make commerce simpler, easier, more democratized, more participatory, and more common. I think that we have built the best commerce platform in the world for that. Technological progress always arcs towards simplicity, and entrepreneurs succeed more when we simplify. But now we are at the dawn of the AI era and the new capabilities that are unlocked by that are unprecedented. Shopify has the privilege of being amongst the companies with the best chances of using AI to help our customers. A copilot for entrepreneurship is now possible. Our main quest demands from us to build the best thing that is now possible, and that has just changed entirely. To those leaving today Everyone will process this in their own way, and it’s hard for everyone, affected or not. For those leaving us today, you will receive a minimum of 16 weeks severance plus a week for every year of tenure at Shopify. Medical benefits and access to our employee assistance program (EAP) will be covered through this same period. We’ll also offer outplacement services if you want them, all office furniture we provided is yours to keep. We legally need the work laptop back, but we’ll help pay for a new one to replace it. You’ll have continued free access to the advanced Shopify plan should you opt to take an entrepreneurial path in future. You’ll have a chance to talk more about this when you meet with a leader later today. We will also keep Slack and internal email open today for everyone so we can share farewells. My sincere thanks go out to each of you for everything you’ve done for Shopify and our merchants.

We need to talk about the cost of bad search. A Google Cloud-commissioned Harris Poll survey found that search abandonment—when a consumer looks for a product on an online store, doesn't find what they want, and leaves—costs retailers around the world more than $2 trillion annually. Enterprise businesses with 1000s of SKUs don't just need great search—they can't afford to do business without it. That’s why we’ve deepened our long-standing partnership with Google to bring Google Cloud’s search and discovery tooling to enterprise brands using Commerce Components by Shopify. Discovery AI solutions will be available to the largest brands in the world to integrate directly with their online stores using Commerce Components by Shopify. “Our partnership with Google Cloud brings together the best in commerce with the best in search to unlock a trillion dollar opportunity for brands,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “We know that 69% of consumers in the US alone say a store’s search is the most common way they shop, but only around 10% are getting consistently accurate search results. It’s a massive problem that we’re excited to help enterprise retailers solve through our continued work with Google.” Google Cloud’s Discovery AI solutions include capabilities like: 1.	Retail Search to provide advanced understanding and better results for even the broadest queries, including non-product and semantic search to effectively match product attributes with store content, leading to fast, relevant product discovery 2.	AI-powered personalization providing optimal product display and ordering once shoppers choose a category, like "women's jackets" or "kitchenware." In addition, search personalization and recommendations AI surface products by recognizing patterns in a consumer’s behavior, such as clicks, adds to cart, purchases, and other information to determine shopper taste and preferences “Google Cloud’s integration with Shopify enables brands to quickly deploy the power of AI,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. “By making it easier for retailers to create best-in-class product discovery experiences, shoppers can now find exactly what they want faster.” One of the first Shopify retailers to use the integration is Rainbow Shops, an apparel brand with locations across the U.S. and 1000s of products. “For a retailer of our size, working with a commerce platform that unlocks agility and flexibility for all parts of our business is critical,” said David Cost, Vice President of eCommerce and Marketing at Rainbow Shops. “Shopify, and their partnership with Google Cloud, means that we easily integrated Google-quality search directly with our online store, and the results speak for themselves with search volume up 48%.” Commerce Components by Shopify, the modern, composable stack for enterprise retail, launched earlier this year. Existing enterprise retailers on Shopify include Mattel, Glossier, JB Hi-Fi, Coty, Steve Madden, Spanx, and Staples. Learn more about Commerce Components by Shopify here. Google Cloud’s Discovery AI solutions are available globally to enterprise retailers using Commerce Components by Shopify.

More than half of Shopify’s entrepreneurs are women. To celebrate International Women’s Day, meet five who are changing the world Trillions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of jobs. Exceptional leaders, thinkers, and innovators. Women play a critical role in powering nearly every economy on earth. At Shopify, 53% of our global entrepreneurs are women. Where the idea of women as entrepreneurs was once unthinkable, there are now more than 413 million women entrepreneurs worldwide. And while it’s still tougher for women to raise venture capital and wage inequality persists, data shows businesses led by women earn more for every dollar invested than their male counterparts. Shopify champions women-led businesses every month, not just this one. But since it’s March, and since we have you here, we want to introduce you to three incredible companies led by women determined to inspire change in their corners of the world and well beyond. We’ll be cheering from the sidelines as they do. In 2020, Sandra Velasquez launched Nopalera, a beauty brand that celebrates her Mexican culture. Three years later, Nopalera is now on shelves at major retailers including Credo Beauty, Nordstrom, and Free People. “I had this idea, this big bold vision that I was going to create a high-end Latina brand that’s going to disrupt the historically Euro-centric beauty space,” Velasquez said. “The more French a word is, the more expensive we think the product should be. If it’s in Spanish, people ask, why is it so expensive? Our culture is rich, beautiful, and worthy of the same price tags.” Velasquez grew up in California, the daughter of Mexican immigrants. Her hometown streets were dotted with nopales, the prickly cacti that would later inspire her to strike out on her own as an entrepreneur. By 43, after a long, successful career as a musician and a stint in sales in the grocery industry in New York, Velasquez couldn’t see a clear path forward. She knew she was capable of more, but wasn’t sure how to get there or what more looked like. She could get another sales job, she thought. Or she could take the risk and try something new. “It forced me to look outside of what I thought my reality could be, to look outside what I thought was possible.” For seven months before launch, she worked three jobs and came home to her Brooklyn apartment at night to pursue a degree in organic skincare formulation in her kitchen-turned-laboratory. She used the oil from the nopales she’d grown up with to create soaps, exfoliants, and moisturizers. Fast forward to today, and you can still find Nopalera on her kitchen table. You can also find it on the shelves of more than 400 boutiques across the U.S. “What drives me? In ten years, you’re going to see our logo on the pitch deck of another Latina entrepreneur. Someone has to be first.” In her years traveling across the Middle East and India to visit her husband’s family, Kathryn Shah always admired the way other cultures presented fruit, nuts, and dates as decadent, elevated indulgences. It was such a stark contrast, she thought, to the way they were kept in dusty bulk bins back home in the U.S. When Shah was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 35, she had an idea. “Everyone was sending me chocolate boxes and cookies. It was lovely, but I’d look at the label and it was crazy what all of these foods included.” One cake she received had 50 ingredients, many of which she found were linked to tumorous cancer growth. “I thought, there has to be something better. Something that’s delicious and beautiful and chic and cool – and good for you.” This at-home recipe testing process is still the same one they use when adding new products to their line, which now includes six bars of date-sweetened chocolate. And when something doesn’t quite work, they use the leftover ingredients piled in their pantries to make muesli, which is a hit with the toddlers running around the pair’s

Shopify partners play a critical role in Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. Since the inception of the Shopify Partner Program over a decade ago, Shopify’s partner network has become the largest commerce ecosystem in the world, a powerful community helping merchants grow faster. As Shopify enters its next era of growth, it is launching the first phase of a multi-year engagement in Shopify’s partner program. To make it easier for every partner to build their business with Shopify, the enhancements focus on three areas: exceptional rewards, skills building, and a simplified, engaging partner experience. Shopify is significantly expanding program incentives to recognize and reward partners. Partners now have the opportunity to earn up to 2x or more in 2023 through revenue share and promotions from referrals to re-invest back into their business. Shopify is also focused on helping partners close more deals through joint marketing and co-selling programs. “Shopify’s investment in its Partner Program opens up immediate opportunities for us to grow our business. The partnership team has focused on building a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship with us and truly listens and responds. The new rewards and incentives are a perfect example of them responding to the voice of their partners.” – Mary Krause, Strategic Alliances Manager at CQL “The Partner Program investments are another example of what makes Shopify such an innovative company and powerful platform. The transformation of Shopify’s Partner Program, particularly with more earning potential, will help fuel our growth and support our customers’ goals.”  - Isaac Newton, Co-Founder of Pattern Comprehensive education and enablement Shopify continues to lead the commerce market in innovation, including the recent release of over 100+ new product updates in Winter ‘23 Edition. To ensure partners are equipped to bring those innovations to their clients, Shopify is launching the first-ever certification program for Shopify partners, with both business foundation and technical certifications. Shopify Certification courses and specialization badges will help partners demonstrate product expertise, and quickly upskill their teams. Partners now have access to an expanded product and sales enablement resource library in their partner dashboard. These assets, along with ongoing live enablement webinars, are built specifically to support partners and help them grow their business. How partners engage with Shopify and build relationships within the Shopify ecosystem will also be reimagined. Shopify has increased its focus on supporting partners' education and earnings potential with expanded virtual and in-person events starting with Partner Education Day on April 4. There will also be an in-person event this fall to celebrate and recognize top-performing commercial partners. "Shopify's continued innovation in the program has played a crucial role in our company's success. That includes their readiness for enterprise-scale commerce, which is the foundation that enables our agency to build world-class websites for some of the largest brands on the planet. Like Shopify we're committed to constant iteration, and these updates to rewards, education and networking reflect that desire to continue learning and improving together." – Piers Thorogood, Co-Founder, We Make Websites “At Imag/nary we invest in iconic, generationally defining brands and the technology solutions that empower them. We have loved working alongside Shopify as they have built out the partner program. The team at Shopify have always gone the extra mile to make sure our portfolio companies have the resources, platform, and attention they need to scale to their maximum potential. We’re thrilled to see Shopify evolve the program and invest further in the partner experience. We are excited to deepen our relationships within this great community.” – Natalie Massenet, Co-founder and Partner, Imag/nary Shifting consumer expectations, the rapid pace of commerce innovation, and a changing economic landscape all significantly increase the value Shopify partners add to merchants navigating constant change. This evolution of the program is designed to empower our network of development and digital marketing agencies, system integrators, technology, venture capital and private equity partners to meet the needs of merchants together.

Black business owners say they’re poised for growth despite lack of access to capital and mentorship, Shopify data reveals 1.	81% of Black entrepreneurs say they must ignore the background noise of racism and stigma to succeed 2.	61% say finding access to capital is a huge challenge 3.	83% say that despite systemic barriers, now is their time to shine At Shopify, we know a world with more voices in commerce is better for both businesses and consumers. Still, commerce today isn’t equitable for all. Imagine if everyone who had the capacity to run a successful business could do it without barriers. How much generational wealth could be created if businesses had the resources they needed to thrive? How many lives could be transformed? Raising awareness of inequity’s impact on entrepreneurship is critical to our quest at Shopify. To better understand the barriers that still exist for Black-owned businesses, we recently surveyed and interviewed more than 500 aspiring and established Black entrepreneurs across North America about their experiences*. We've published the results in a new research study, In Pursuit of Equitable Commerce: Insights on Black entrepreneurship in 2023 and beyond. Here’s what we learned: Access to capital – on better terms – is critical Racial and social justice movements have catalyzed public support for Black businesses over the last three years. That’s led to promises of investments and loans from banks, investment firms, and tech companies, among others. Still, it hasn’t solved one of the central problems Black-owned businesses face. Nearly two thirds (61%) of entrepreneurs say finding access to capital is a huge challenge. Even securing grants meant for Black businesses is challenging for nearly 60% of Black entrepreneurs. Many say they turn to unfavorable forms of finance –  personal savings, costly credit cards, and hard-to-access grants – to keep the lights on. When asked what would help their businesses succeed, the answer was clear: easier access to financing, and better terms on that capital, topped the list. Inequity costs the economy billions of dollars More money and mentorship in the hands of Black entrepreneurs would open up selling opportunities and rev the engine of the economy – to the tune of $190 billion**. According to Shopify’s data, more than three quarters (78%) of Black business owners say finding customers who aren’t Black is a challenge. Empowering them with access to digital platforms and service providers would give them more avenues to increase advertising. We’ve partnered with non-profit Operation HOPE to create one million new Black-owned businesses (1MBB) by 2030. Black entrepreneurs work harder and smarter for their success More than half (56%) of Black entrepreneurs we surveyed said they knew they were playing on an uneven field. For them, that means working harder and smarter to succeed. Most of the entrepreneurs we surveyed (81%) agreed it was essential to ignore the background noise of racism and stigma or they’d never get their business off the ground. Still, they won’t let those barriers stop them: 83% say now is their time to shine, and 68% feel optimistic about their business growth potential. “The public’s increased awareness of social justice movements like Black Lives Matter has led to more tangible support for Black businesses, which has Black entrepreneurs optimistic,” said Brandon Davenport, Head of Equitable Commerce for Shopify. “For all my fellow dreamers who are sitting on an idea and waiting for the right moment, that moment is now.” At Shopify, we truly believe it’s possible to make entrepreneurship more inclusive for everyone and to inject billions into the economy while doing it. Our research shows more than half (59%) of entrepreneurs would rather take control of their own businesses than seek outside help. The other 41% expressed a desire to call on experts for advice. Over the next ten years, our Equitable Commerce initiative will power an ecosystem of services: access to capital, expert mentors, unique selling opportunities. We’re using four pillars – community, advocacy, research, and education – to empower and support entrepreneurs in the areas that make the most sense for them. You can learn more about how we plan to do that here. Watch this space, and download our research study below for more.

Shopify is built on components that form the world's most powerful retail platform. We've spent nearly two decades building, optimizing, and scaling that infrastructure, which today powers over 10% of US ecommerce and has processed over half a trillion dollars—all while giving millions of businesses full control of their brand identity, customer relationships, and data. Now, we are opening that infrastructure to power the biggest retailers in the world with Commerce Components by Shopify (CCS), the modern, composable stack for enterprise retail. For enterprise retailers today, challenges like the rapid pace of tech evolution and shifting customer expectations mean they must achieve real-time innovation just to remain competitive. To do that, they need a commerce solution that prioritizes choice, with the flexibility to integrate and innovate without restrictions, while offering trusted infrastructure components that help their teams move faster. These elements together are non-negotiable, and have never existed in one offering for enterprise—until now. Commerce Components by Shopify combines the best of both worlds for enterprise retailers: access to Shopify’s foundational, high-performing components that just work—like our checkout, which converts 72% better than a typical checkout, and 91% better on mobile—plus flexible APIs to build dynamic customer experiences that integrate seamlessly with a retailer’s preferred back office services. “We’ve always approached innovation at Shopify by anticipating what retailers need, then providing those solutions,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “Commerce Components by Shopify opens our infrastructure so enterprise retailers don’t have to waste time, engineering power, and money building critical foundations Shopify has already perfected, and instead frees them up to customize, differentiate, and scale.” Iconic American brand Mattel will be one of the first enterprise retailers to use Commerce Components, bringing their entire portfolio of brands to Shopify. “Innovation is at the heart of Mattel,” said Sven Gerjets, CTO of Mattel. “We first worked with Shopify on a project called Mattel Creations, a platform for creators to reimagine the most iconic toys in the world. Creations empowered Mattel to move quickly, meet our customers where they are, and most importantly leverage Shopify’s infrastructure to scale globally. It was hugely successful, and we’re excited to transform our brand offerings using Commerce Components.” Featuring an all-new back-office management designed specifically for enterprise, Commerce Components by Shopify gives retailers the speed and flexibility needed to build for the future. Build with choice •	Flexible APIs, now with no rate limits, allow brands to integrate their existing services with Shopify’s modular components and build unparalleled customer experiences for any device. Enterprise retailers can take the components they need, and leave what they don’t, and developers are free to build with any front-end framework they choose. Tap into unmatched global scale •	Trusted commerce foundations, like the world’s best-converting checkout, with 99.99% uptime, processing up to 40,000 checkouts per minute per store, and unlocking over 100 million existing Shop Pay customers, who have opted in for Shopify’s one-click checkout. •	Shopify’s globally scaled infrastructure with over 275 network edge points of presence enables lightning-fast storefronts no matter where customers are in the world.

At Shopify, we know the only way to future-proof our planet is to reverse climate change. Even if we stopped all emissions right now, there’s still too much carbon in the atmosphere. No solution will single-handedly solve this problem. When it comes to scaling carbon removal technologies, there’s much more work to do. Since we launched our Sustainability Fund in 2019, Shopify has been buying carbon removal as part of our effort to kickstart an industry in its infancy. Today, alongside Stripe, we’re purchasing $11 million worth of carbon removal from six new companies: Arbor, Captura, Carbon To Stone, Cella, CREW, and Inplanet. It’s an exciting development in our fight to reverse climate change. We’re inspired by the caliber and rate of new companies entering the market. Through these purchases, we’re making it possible for them to prove their impact and scale. These six new companies bring the total backed by Shopify to 28. Below, you can read more about each new partner. These new purchases are just one part of the critical work Shopify has done this year to help accelerate this market. Here’s what else we’ve been up to in 2022: To start the year, Shopify’s Sustainability Fund added nine new businesses to our portfolio. Our purchases helped them bring their vision to market and increase adoption of their offerings. Through our Fund activities, we’ve helped multiple companies raise over $50 million in capital and increase their employee count by more than 5x, which has enabled them to grow their carbon removal capacity by more than 1000x. This spring, we launched Frontier, an advance market commitment (AMC), alongside Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability. As founders of Frontier, we committed to spending a combined $925 million on carbon removal by the end of 2030 – a signal to innovators, investors, and project developers that there is a market for carbon removal, and we all need to get to work scaling the industry. In June, we released Planet, an app that Shopify merchants can use to zero out their shipping emissions. Planet calculates the estimated shipping emissions from every order. Merchants then remove these emissions by funding the same carbon removal companies supported by Shopify. Since launch, more than 8,000 Shopify merchants have used Planet to neutralize their shipping emissions on more than six million orders, totaling over 5,000 tonnes of carbon removal. Shopify merchants can install Planet from the Shopify App Store. Most recently, we published Buying Carbon Removal, Explained. It’s a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to support carbon removal but has hit roadblocks along the way. Buying Carbon Removal, Explained covers everything from researching suppliers to inking your first carbon removal contracts, and what to say to scrutinizing finance teams. We’re committed to doing all we can to generate demand for carbon removal, enable new companies to prove their impact and scale, and spend millions every year to drive down future prices. I recently had the privilege of speaking more about this at the TED Countdown London Session. You can check it out at go.ted.com/stacykauk. That’s it for now. Subscribe to our mailing list for updates from us in 2023. We’ve got even more planned for the new year, as our work continues.

As a global provider of essential internet infrastructure for commerce, Shopify announced today a record-setting Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend, with sales of $7.5 billion* from independent businesses worldwide. That’s a 19% increase in sales from the $6.3 billion during Shopify’s Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend in 2021 (21% on a constant currency basis). Consumers are approaching this holiday shopping season with intentionality. They’re seeking out good deals from their favorite brands. Shopify’s recent survey of more than 24,000 consumers around the world revealed that three in four (76%) were seeking higher-quality products that will last, and the majority (84%) planned to compare prices for the best discounts before making a purchase during Black Friday Cyber Monday Weekend**. More than 52 million consumers globally purchased from brands powered by Shopify this year, a 12% increase from 2021. Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend is the highest volume shopping event of the year for Shopify merchants. And, while not a proxy for the full holiday season, it is a moment that showcases the power and impact independent businesses have around the globe. “This year, Black Friday Cyber Monday showed us once again that consumers are voting with their wallets to support the independent brands they love,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “We saw record level shopping happening across all channels this weekend, proving businesses that meet their customers where they are, whether that’s online or in-person, will earn their loyalty in return.” 2022 Black Friday Cyber Monday Global Highlights 1.	Black Friday saw the highest shopping volume moment during the weekend, with peak sales of more than $3.5 million per minute at 12:01 PM EST on November 25. 2.	52 million consumers worldwide purchased from independent brands powered by Shopify, a 12% increase from 2021. 3.	Shoppers’ spend climbed across many countries, with consumers globally spending $102.10 per order on average throughout the weekend (or $104.80 on a constant currency basis) compared to the global average of $100.70 we shared last year***. 4.	The top-selling cities shoppers made purchases from include London, New York, and Los Angeles. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada were among the top-selling countries worldwide. 5.	Top product categories: Apparel & accessories, followed by health & beauty, and home & garden, with trending products including: Gymshark (Training Leggings), MIELLE (Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil), and  Our Place (Always Pan). 6.	Black Friday Cyber Monday proved once again to be driven by online sales, with 73% of sales made on mobile devices and 27% on desktop. 7.	Cross-border orders represent 15% of all global orders and the most popular cross-border routes include Canada-United States, United States-Canada, and United Kingdom-United States. 8.	56,000+ tonnes of carbon removal funded to counteract emissions from the delivery of every order placed on Shopify’s platform during Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend.

Shopify’s new Black Friday Cyber Monday global research survey reveals shoppers are looking for products that last, businesses are looking to connect with customers across more channels, climate-conscious shopping is growing on a mass scale, and brand loyalty is up for grabsA changing economic environment means a new shape for commerce—from high volume and low prices, to value that lasts. As we gear up for the 2022 Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend—an event that last year saw 47 million+ shoppers buying from independent brands powered by Shopify—we surveyed more than 24,000 consumers and 9,000 small and medium businesses around the world to learn how cost-of-living spikes are affecting spending habits and retailers worldwide*. What we heard, loud and clear, is that businesses and shoppers plan to be more considered, conscious, and connected this holiday shopping season. Expect more intentional spending; more climate-conscious shoppers seeking out brands with sustainable practices; and businesses planning for a big BFCM weekend, selling to their customers across multiple surfaces - from social media to in-store and everywhere in between. “Black Friday Cyber Monday is more than just a weekend–it’s a season. It is without a doubt the biggest commerce event of the year. I’ve said this before: modern retailers need to sell wherever their customers spend time–online, offline, and everywhere in between,” said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. “If you’ve built a community and a direct relationship with your customers, you’ll also secure their loyalty. Consumers are voting with their wallets to support the brands they love that reflect their values.” Consumers’ motto this year? Quality over quantity. Three in four consumers (76%) we surveyed want to spend on higher-quality products that will last. While three in four (75%) have also reduced their spending in the last couple of months, more than half (57%) of consumers said they’ll spend as much or more this BFCM than last year. That’s a strong signal for businesses worldwide, as our data suggests 75% of them are planning to offer better deals this BFCM weekend. “Taylor Morris sells luxury eyewear, but we pride ourselves on being accessible. Getting the offer right has never been more important. We’re exploring new ways customers can buy into our brand in a budget-friendly way, like offering prescription glasses on subscription or adding more support services,” said Nicholas Dellaportas, founder of Taylor Morris Eyewear in the U.K. “When a customer’s prescription changes, we’re adding more options to adapt their existing lenses instead of them buying a whole new pair.” Good for the budget; good for the planet. Consumers are feeling the squeeze on their wallets this year, and it’s showing in how they’re prioritizing their spend. Most shoppers (84%) we surveyed said they’ll compare prices before they buy. Millennials are the keenest bargain hunters—77% said they’re more likely to shop sales to get the most for their money. And 65% of Gen Z consumers will set more money aside this year, as they plan for a festive holiday season. Two thirds of shoppers (67%) also told us that despite this pinch, they’re still planning to treat themselves each month. And 69% are looking to spend on smaller purchases that bring them joy, marking an opportunity for businesses whose products offer everyday delight in uncertain times. One thing consumers aren’t willing to budge on, despite the bills biting this year, is sustainability. Globally, two of every five shoppers (40%) we surveyed are willing to pay extra for climate-conscious products. Even more of them (43%) say they’re more likely to buy from brands with sustainability practices, such as carbon-neutral shipping or taking a “low or no waste” approach. A bonus for retailers who offer climate-conscious items? Word-of-mouth. Three in five customers (63%) are more likely to recommend a product if they know it’s less harmful to the environment. Shoppers (63%) are also putting more effort than ever into researching which brands are keeping their promises when it comes to the climate crisis, prioritizing products with recyclable packaging and buying local to reduce their environmental impact.

When it comes to paying people for the work they do it’s generally straightforward. For tech companies, the story goes a little something like this: 1.	Company extends offer (in the form of a nicely bundled letter...kind of). 2.	Employee accepts offer (a forever contract despite any changes life throws at them). 3.	Employee does good work, and so company pays employee per agreement (except that nice bundled offer letter now becomes a confusing mess of paystub, equity portal, benefits portals, etc.). And while the world and the people in it have changed, this story has stayed the same for decades. But at Shopify, it no longer made sense. We saw an opportunity to write a better story: Flex Comp, an approach to compensation that changes the very foundation of how we reward talent. Here’s how our story goes… We built Flex Comp to help define the future of compensation at Shopify, and inspire it beyond just Shopify, with a focus on three key elements: Agency: Bringing agency to our people was a foundational principle for our build. Why should a company decide for you how much of your total reward should be in the form of cash vs equity? This makes no sense. Now, our employees can choose exactly how they want to allocate their total reward. Saving to buy a house? Take more cash. Early in your career? You might want to take more restricted stock units (RSUs) or options. We also killed the one-year cliff on equity, so vesting begins right away, and, because life happens, allocation windows will open a few times a year. This means your equity will no longer be tied to the quarter you started, and you can adjust your choices as your needs change. Clarity: Under the old industry structure, it was annoying and time-consuming to understand exactly how much you earned. You’d find base salary on your pay stub and equity in another, made even more complicated by vesting schedules, stock-market unpredictability, and unreliable bonuses tied to company performance. Figuring out your annual take home pay was a pain. Flex Comp lays it all out, simply – our UX design bundles all aspects of total rewards for the first time so employees now have a one-stop-shop for understanding pay. Impact: We’re a mission-driven company, and everything we build is in support of this mission – including this new comp system. We’re tying rewards to the mission, not the market or world events. As employees advance in their careers and have a positive impact on our mission, their compensation will grow (no speed limits here). Armed with a strong vision of what we were building, we got to work. The ongoing industry-wide realities in which we had to operate were not uncomplicated: compensation tied to market value; geographic salary disparities for a global workforce; and the few making choices for the many. There were as many reasons not to pursue this as there were to dig into it. But this is peak Shopify territory. We set a bold vision for what can exist – and then we build it. Turning our product-obsessed mindset on ourselves, we gathered people from nearly every team at Shopify to bring this massive overhaul to life. The team took on the ambitious build and timeline, even hunkering down in a two-week coding sprint that saw everyone from our Founder and CEO to developers in a war room, pair-programming late into the night. The commitment to build the best possible system that would work for a diverse set of employees in different jobs, geographies, and levels, each with their own unique needs was palpable. And it paid off, with room to build in the future.

Shopify Capital launches in Australia ahead of peak sales season August 21, 2022 Shopify Capital is launching in Australia to provide quick and easy funding up to $2.5 million AUD for thousands of merchants to accelerate growth, expand to new markets, and prepare for the peak sales season. Today, concerns about inflation, consumer spending, cash flow and lingering supply chain challenges have created challenging business conditions for retailers. Though, now more than ever it’s important businesses remain agile and seek new forms of revenue and growth. This is the time of year when Aussie merchants are preparing their business for the upcoming peak sales season — ordering inventory, planning campaigns, sorting shipping and hiring talent. Though, timely access to funding to make these investments is one of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs. In fact, Shopify research found that while 62% of Australian merchants are comfortable seeking funds to invest in their business, two-thirds (67%) are deterred by high interest rates and more than half (53%) are turned off by lengthy application processes and timeframes. Traditional lenders often require business owners to apply through lengthy and complex processes. Shopify Capital isn’t traditional financing. There’s no lengthy application process and we don’t do personal credit checks, take equity in the business or ask merchants for cash flow projections. Instead, merchants receive offers up to $2.5 million AUD through the same Shopify platform they already use to run their store. Shopify Capital has experts that can review our data-informed and machine learning models to ensure a merchant receives the funding they need to help grow their business. Once approved, funds are deposited in as little as two business days for merchants to use how they choose for their business, with most investing in talent, inventory and marketing to maximise growth or bridge cash flow during seasonal dips. Essentially, Shopify Capital fills the gap that traditional lenders generally cannot satisfy by providing businesses with the funding they need, when they need it most — now, not months from now. As merchants make sales, they repay based on an agreed fixed percentage of daily sales — lowering cash flow risks by removing the uncertainty of compounding interest rates and hidden fees. There is no specified time limit for repayment — merchants pay back funding based on their sales, so payments flex with their business. Since launching in 2016, Shopify Capital has provided more than $3.8 billion USD in funding to tens of thousands of entrepreneurs in the US, UK and Canada, a 90% increase in total funding in the past 15 months. This funding has been vital as businesses look to accelerate growth, with merchants that received funding through Shopify Capital averaging 36% higher sales in the following six months compared to their peers. Tracey Jewel, Manager at Batherapy, is a clear example of growth achieved through Shopify Capital. Boosted by two rounds of funding through Shopify Capital, Tracey expanded her business from selling online-only DIY bath kits to creating in-studio bath and body product workshops across Perth. “Access to funding has traditionally required business owners to jump through hoops for something that should be quite easy. Now we can quickly access funding through the same platform I already use to run my business and don’t have to think about repayments as they’re automatically made as a portion of each sale," said Tracey. The first round of funding helped to quickly boost supplies to support the opening of our first studio space in inner-city Perth, and we’ve since repaid the first round and accessed an additional round to fast-track the opening of three new studios across the city.

New partnership means creators and merchants can combine commerce and community with the launch of YouTube Shopping to Shopify’s millions of merchants around the world 1.	Merchants can easily integrate their online store with one of the world’s biggest entertainment platforms—reaching over 2 billion monthly logged-in users 2.	YouTube Shopping allows Shopify merchants to sell their full range of products in three ways: live streams, videos, and store tab 3.	Shopify is the retail operating system for merchants and creators selling across multiple channels, making it easy to manage their commerce business from one place Today, every brand is focused on one thing: connecting with their audience. Meaningful engagement with consumers is no longer a nice-to-have—it’s a necessity. This shift has put content at the center of brand interactions, and given rise to the creator economy, blurring the line between merchant and creator. Content creators are selling goods and building fully realized brands, and D2C merchants are creating content as a way to find and engage with new customers. Now, Shopify and YouTube are partnering to give merchants and creators a powerful new way to connect to consumers, build their businesses, and share their stories. With the launch of the YouTube Shopping on Shopify, merchants can easily integrate their online store with one of the world’s biggest entertainment platforms—reaching over 2 billion monthly logged-in users—to meet their consumers, and viewers, where they are. Shopify merchants can sell their full range of products on YouTube in three ways: 1.	Live streams: Merchants can tag and pin products at key points during a livestream, and picture-in-picture playback means consumers can watch while they check out 2.	Videos: Merchants can show a curated list of products in a product shelf below on-demand videos 3.	Store tab: A new tab will be added to a merchant’s YouTube channel, featuring their entire selection of products “Bringing my commerce platform and my most popular viewer engagement platform together will be a game changer for me,” said Christen Dominique, YouTuber and CEO of Dominique Cosmetics. “As an entrepreneur finding new ways to build my business, it's so important that I show up where my customers are shopping, and more and more that's on YouTube. With the Shopify and YouTube integration, I can share new products from Dominique Cosmetics directly on my videos and lives, and make it easy for viewers to purchase as they watch.” Because Shopify acts as a merchant’s retail operating system, product details including names, images, pricing, and shipping are seamlessly kept up-to-date across channels. If a product sells out, it’s automatically removed from YouTube. Merchants can also track performance of live and on-demand videos directly from their Shopify admin, with a full view of multichannel sales. And, for select eligible merchants in the U.S., onsite check on YouTube means consumers can purchase without leaving the platform. Commerce today is multichannel, and YouTube is one of the most influential channels on the planet," said Kaz Nejatian, VP of Product at Shopify. "Shopify's new YouTube integration will fundamentally change what opportunity looks like for independent brands in the creator economy. We're thrilled to expand our long-term partnership with Google to push the boundaries of D2C commerce on YouTube. For years, creators have built businesses around their YouTube content, often extending their entrepreneurship into building their own brands, but it hasn’t been as seamless to reach their audience with these products directly on YouTube,” said David Katz, VP of Shopping Product at YouTube. “We’re excited to partner with Shopify to help creators easily bring their stores front and center for their communities on YouTube, who are increasingly turning to them to shop."

Paths to success as a retail entrepreneur were once few and far between. The options were as obvious as they were limited: open a physical store or sell through a marketplace. The process was costly and attainable only to the few. But Shopify was born to break down barriers for merchants and make the seemingly impossible possible. With our first product—the Online Store—we made entrepreneurship accessible to all. This internet-native approach gave rise to the global D2C phenomenon and disrupted online shopping as we know it. And we’re about to change the face of commerce—again. Today, we’re unveiling Shopify Editions, our new semi-annual product showcase that features new launches and improvements across the entire platform. With our Summer ‘22 Edition, we’re ushering in an era of commerce that’s more expansive than ever—and we’re calling it Connect-to-Consumer (C2C). Shopify pioneered the D2C movement by giving entrepreneurs a direct line to consumers. Today, we’re paving endless pathways for merchants to build their businesses. With 100+ product updates, our Summer ‘22 Edition signals the speed of innovation, as well as the breadth and depth of what we’ve developed across online storefronts, offline experiences, Web3, social commerce, checkout, and much, much more. From selling wholesale to taking advantage of social commerce, strengthening community and expanding offline, here’s a snapshot of some of our new releases from all of the exciting products featured in Shopify Editions. Connecting to consumers isn’t just something that happens one-to-one. A world of opportunity exists when merchants connect with other businesses to sell wholesale. How big is that opportunity? Billions of untapped revenue and multiple times that of D2C*. That’s why we’re introducing B2B on Shopify. B2B on Shopify makes it seamless for Shopify Plus merchants to sell to other businesses on the same platform that they use for D2C. Say goodbye to spreadsheets, one-off invoices, and manual data entry. Not to mention, we’re also partnering with ERP providers such as NetSuite, Brightpearl, and Acumatica to automatically integrate merchants’ essential data with our B2B solution. For a merchant’s wholesale customers, B2B on Shopify provides a similar online store experience that we know consumers love, but optimized for business buyers with tools that make it simple to purchase products in bulk. For example, we’ve developed a checkout with the payment flexibility needed for B2B, so merchants can set customer-specific prices at fixed rates or discounted retail prices for all of their products. It's the Shopify everyone knows and loves, but tailor-fit for wholesale. Tokengated commerce: Everyone’s talking about NFTs these days. We believe the most exciting experience isn’t selling NFTs, but activating them. Enter: Tokengated commerce on Shopify. Shopify merchants have already built passionate communities and loyal fans of their brand. It’s one of the best things about being an entrepreneur. Now, tokengated commerce offers a fundamentally new way to deepen those connections, and reward true fans and VIPs, by giving NFT holders exclusive access to products, perks, and experiences. For these consumers-turned-fans, all they need to do is connect their crypto wallets to a Shopify online store, and they can use their NFTs to unlock exciting experiences. Best of all, merchants will be able to activate Shopify tokengated commerce experiences everywhere—from online to mobile to physical retail through POS.

A letter from Shopify’s Head of Sustainability Stacy Kauk Shopify’s stance on climate change has been loud and clear since introducing our Sustainability Fund in 2019: we need to fight this together. Reducing emissions is an important component of combating climate change, but even if we stopped all emissions right now, there’s still too much carbon in our atmosphere. We must start working on these climate-saving technologies to protect our future. That’s why we’re launching a much-needed advance market commitment (AMC) called Frontier alongside Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability. The AMC model was successfully piloted a decade ago to speed up development of pneumococcal vaccines for low-income countries, saving an estimated 700,000 lives. We are the first to apply this model to carbon removal at scale. As founders of Frontier, we plan to commit a combined initial $925M to purchase permanent carbon removal from companies building promising new solutions over the next nine years, starting in 2022. Our combined demand signal is exactly what the market needs to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies. This AMC is designed to give the industry, including researchers, entrepreneurs, project developers, and investors, confidence to begin building today–and to do so with urgency. Frontier will become the world’s largest combined financial commitment to buy carbon removal, and I am proud to join its Founder Advisory Board. Let me share more about how the AMC will run, and how you can get involved. The commitment is intended to spur new technologies and support those with the greatest long-term potential by helping them scale. In practice, this likely means paying high prices per tonne today. But it will allow us to accelerate promising technologies that meet specific criteria, including: 1.	Permanence: Stores carbon permanently (>1,000 years) 2.	Physical footprint: Takes advantage of carbon sinks less constrained by arable land 3.	Cost: Has a path to being affordable at scale (<$100/tonne) 4.	Capacity: Has a path to being a meaningful carbon removal solution (>0.5gt/year) 5.	Environmental justice: Ensures meaningful environmental justice outcomes via a robust process focused on local public engagement This AMC is Shopify’s next big move in our fight to reverse climate change. We have made significant strides since launching our Fund in 2019, supporting carbon removal solutions by partnering with 22 entrepreneurial, tech-driven companies and committing more than $32M to climate entrepreneurs. Our purchases have helped our climate-forward partners, including Carbon Engineering, Charm Industrial, Heirloom Carbon, Planetary Hydrogen, and Running Tide, raise tens of millions of dollars, grow their carbon removal capacity by as much as 80x, and/or increase their customer bases by as much as 40x. Our first-of-their-kind agreements have demonstrated voluntary market demand, but it’s not enough. We know we can’t continue to scale carbon removal alone. We are thrilled about the possibilities that Frontier will bring to the carbon removal market. Our mission here is to remove friction and enable other companies to easily buy carbon removal, to set high-quality standards, and take a leading role in scaling carbon removal companies selected by Frontier. Want to join us? Find out how to become an early Frontier buyer to help accelerate this historic carbon removal initiative at FrontierClimate.com. - Stacy Kauk

What is “maskne”? The scientific term is “acne mechanica”, a type of acne caused by excessive friction, heat and rubbing on the skin. It is typically experienced by athletes from the masks and straps they have to wear for prolonged periods but with the arrival of COVID-19, maskne has become more common as wearing face coverings is now an essential part of our everyday lives. Why is your mask making you break out? Acne bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes or P. acnes) lives on the skin of all human beings. That might not be the most pleasant thing to hear, but it’s just a part of the natural microbiome that hangs out on our bodies with all the other bacteria. Most of the time, acne bacteria plays nice with the other bacteria but once it decides to colonize in the pores and hair follicles and feed on the dead skin and oil in there, it presents itself as an infection/acne breakout. Sweat and the humidity created by breathing into your mask is a breeding ground for P. acnes bacteria, which likes a warm, moist environment to grow in. Masks can increase your risk of getting clogged pores and breakouts because they act like an occlusive, not allowing the skin to “breathe”, causing oil, sweat, dirt and makeup to become trapped in the pores. Prolonged wearing of a mask causes friction on the skin, which can lead to inflammation and irritation, leaving it susceptible to infection. All of this can be a recipe for disaster for clear skin! So what can you do to help prevent maskne? 1.	The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings to help reduce the spread of the COVID-19 to others. 100% cotton is effective but breathable, reducing sweat and moisture on the skin. 2.	Wash masks frequently to remove any sweat, oil and dirt buildup. 3.	Reevaluate your skincare routine/products. Because of the occlusion caused by the mask, active products like retinols and acids will be delivered further into the skin, increasing the risk of compromising your moisture barrier, which can make you susceptible to irritation and breakouts. Only apply actives at night and reduce or stop usage if any irritation becomes present. A more basic skincare routine might be more suitable for you right now if you are required to wear a mask for prolonged periods of time. 4.	Keep your skin well-moisturized to decrease friction from the mask. 5.	Take a break from makeup. Since the lower half of your face will be covered anyway, consider skipping the foundation/concealer in that area to eliminate one more thing that could clog your pores. Try a tinted moisturizer if you still feel like you need a little coverage. 6.	Wash your face with a mild cleanser every night to remove any makeup, oil and dirt that have accumulated on your skin throughout the day. Follow with a hydrating moisturizer. 7.	When required to wear a mask for prolonged periods, keep several clean masks with you and switch them out periodically. 8.	Drink lots of water. Keeping hydrated is essential for healthy skin. 9.	Reduce stress whenever possible. Stress is one of the main triggers of acne and the acne itself causes more stress, becoming a vicious cycle. Finding ways to decompress is very important, especially right now during this particularly trying time, not only for your skin but for your overall health. 10.	Consult your dermatologist if you’re experiencing any rashes, allergic reactions or severe acne.

What is laser tattoo removal? A Laser tattoo removal procedure is a non-invasive treatment that uses laser energy to break down the ink particles in a tattoo, allowing the body’s natural processes to remove them. The laser sends pulses of light through the top layer of skin and into the tattoo, which are absorbed by the ink particles. This causes the ink particles to break down into smaller pieces, which can then be naturally eliminated by the body’s immune system. If you’re looking for a laser tattoo removal near you, there are several options to consider: Dermatologists and Plastic Surgeons are skin care specialists who are trained to treat a wide range of skin conditions, and often offer tattoo removal. Dermatologists and Plastic Surgeons are not limited to tattoo removal devices, so they can choose the best treatment or combination for your specific needs. Tattoo removal clinics specialize in removing tattoos using tattoo removal devices like the Lutronic Hollywood Spectra. Their experienced treatment providers specialize in only one thing, which many see as a benefit. These clinics usually offer a range of laser tattoo removal services and can help you choose the right treatment plan. Med Spas are wellness centers that often offer laser tattoo removal. Med Spas are a great option if you’re looking for a relaxing and comfortable environment in which to get your tattoo removed, and you might find other aesthetic offerings that suit your interests. How much does laser tattoo removal cost? The cost of tattoo removal can vary greatly depending on several factors, such as the size and location of the tattoo, the color of the ink, the type of laser used, and the professional performing the procedure. Here are some general price ranges you may expect: Laser tattoo removal: On average, a laser tattoo removal session can cost anywhere from $200 up to $500 or more per session, with multiple sessions required over 6–10 week intervals for complete removal. The total cost of laser removal will depend on the size, depth, and color of the tattoo, as well as the number of sessions required. The number of treatments required for tattoo removal varies based on several factors, including: Color and Size of the tattoo: Larger tattoos with multiple colors typically require more treatments than smaller, single-color (most often black ink) tattoos. Age of the tattoo: Older tattoos may require fewer treatments than newer tattoos, as the ink has already begun to naturally break down and fade. Newer tattoo ink is usually more challenging to break up with laser energy. Depth of the ink: Tattoos that have been placed deeply and densely into the skin typically require more treatments than those that are shallow and less dense. Type of ink used: Certain types of ink, such as amateur or homemade tattoos, can be more difficult to remove and may require more treatments for both men and women. Ink is not highly regulated, and carbon-based inks versus iron-oxide based inks clear at different rates. It is hard to predict, but experienced providers can help determine the expectations after the first few tattoo removal treatment sessions. Skin type: People with darker skin may require more treatments than those with lighter skin, as the laser energy needs to be used more cautiously in patients with darker skin. On average, most people require between 5 and 10 treatments for the full tattoo removal process (usually defined as >90% reduction in the appearance of tattoo ink), but some people may require more or fewer treatments depending on the factors listed above. It’s important to keep in mind that complete removal of a tattoo is not always possible, and some residual ink or discoloration may remain after treatment. Top tattoo removal laser on the Market Conclusion It’s important to note that laser tattoo removal is not a guarantee for complete removal, and some residual ink or discoloration may remain after treatment. The success of the procedure also depends on the patient’s skin type, the location of the tattoo, and the age of the tattoo. However, laser tattoo removal is generally considered safe and effective, and has become a popular alternative to traditional tattoo removal methods such as surgical excision or dermabrasion.

Having worked in aesthetics for over 25 years, I have treated many different skin conditions, with Melasma being a very common complaint. Greek in origin, the word “Melasma” loosely translates as “black spot”, a testament to the stubbornness of the condition. Appearing most commonly across the forehead, cheeks and upper lip, Melasma is different from other forms of hyperpigmentation in that not only is it exacerbated by ultraviolet light, but it is hormonally-induced, making it extremely difficult to treat successfully. Who is at risk of getting Melasma? While ¹Melasma can affect up to 33% of the population, women are at a much higher risk of having it than men, who only make up about 10% of the 33%. 15% to 50% of pregnant women experience Melasma (commonly referred to as “pregnancy mask”, which usually fades post-pregnancy) and it is most common during a woman’s reproductive years, typically appearing between 20-40 years of age. Oral contraceptives can also put women at a higher risk of Melasma due to the increase in estrogen and progesterone, which are believed to be the hormones that contribute to the condition. Individuals with darker skin types are also more likely to experience Melasma due to the increased melanin in their skin. People with hypothyroidism can be at higher risk for Melasma as well, due to the hormonal imbalances caused by an underactive thyroid. ¹Source: Cleveland Clinic – Melasma Why does my Melasma seem to fade and come back? Anyone who has seen their Melasma improve only to have it ultimately return knows the frustration of trying to treat it. Because there are so many contributing factors, and the strong role that hormonal fluctuations play in the condition, it is notoriously problematic to get under control and keep under control. While it can occur at any time of the year, most individuals will experience a rebound in their Melasma over the summer months, when it is exacerbated by the heat and sun, and see it fade in the winter months. But regardless of the season or the weather, it’s extremely important to wear a broad-spectrum SPF every day to minimize the negative effects of UV radiation as much as possible. I wear SPF daily, but is there anything else I can do to improve my Melasma? With the last days of summer fun in the sun behind us and the holidays looming ahead, many people are looking to laser treatments to fade their Melasma and improve their overall complexion. Is there a laser that is safe for treating Melasma? The Lutronic Hollywood Spectra is the first short-pulse laser to earn FDA clearance for treating Melasma and can be used on all skin types. Not only will you see an improvement in your Melasma, but with its collagen-stimulating capabilities, a series of Hollywood Spectra treatments will leave your skin looking brighter and clearer, with a reduced appearance of fine lines and wrinkles! If you are suffering from Melasma, just know that you’re not alone. And while there is no cure, it is treatable and controllable.

To keep pace with the rate of change in commerce, our merchants need to deliver the best shopping experience for their customers. Today, we're making this easier by announcing the release of subscription and post-purchase upsell apps that are fully integrated with Shopify Checkout for the first time. Merchants can now seamlessly sell subscription products and offer post-purchase upsells directly in Shopify Checkout. By adding these new capabilities, Shopify is making our conversion-optimized checkout – which has been tried and tested through 2.5 billion transactions in over 175 countries – even more flexible. These new apps are also fully integrated with our back-office, meaning merchants can now manage orders and use features like Shopify Payments all within the Shopify platform. Shopify has seen increasing demand for fully integrated subscription and upsell apps, with current apps in this category growing 61% YOY on our platform from 2019 to 2020. Over the last year, we've worked closely with our partners to improve the overall subscription management and buyer experience. As a result, merchants can better capitalize on the ecommerce recurring payment and subscriptions market, which is projected to reach $478 billion by 2025 (up from an estimated $15 billion in 2019). Similarly, demand for post-purchase upsell apps on Shopify has increased. By presenting offers in Shopify Checkout after payment is confirmed, merchants can offer one-click product upsells without compromising conversion and interrupting the customer experience. “Opening Shopify Checkout for the first time is a big deal for us since it’s the single most important customer experience that we’ve spent over a decade optimizing,” said Jean-Michel Lemieux, CTO, Shopify. “With the new apps, over 1 million merchants around the world can now sell recurring products or add post-purchase upsells—all without compromising the buyer experience at checkout. Giving our developer partners the ability to build integrated solutions within checkout showcases the value we see in these apps to enable flexibility, scale and resilience for our merchants.” Historically, Shopify merchants could offer subscriptions and post-purchase upsells using apps that aren’t fully integrated with the Shopify Checkout and platform. As of today, merchants can easily download these fully integrated apps from the Shopify App Store to deliver smooth buying experiences; subscription APIs are also available directly to all merchants if they want to build a custom solution. Regardless of which app merchants choose to install, their orders and customer data will be kept within Shopify. This means merchants will be able to manage all transactions in one place, gain actionable insights, and benefit from all of our platform features like shipping, discounts, and more. The new integrated subscriptions and post-purchase upsell offerings join over 5,300 publicly available apps in the Shopify Ecosystem. They are the first of many integrated apps our partners are building in these categories in order to meet future needs of merchants and buyers.

Budget 2023 further integrates nuclear power into Canada’s clean energy strategy March 28, 2023 Through the announcement of Federal Budget 2023, the Government of Canada has indicated its clear and strong support for nuclear power playing an indispensable role in the country’s clean energy transition while ensuring domestic energy security. In addition to being included in the clean energy investment tax credit, nuclear has been made eligible for a range of other tax incentives, further leveling the playing field for clean energy technologies, and enabling nuclear to compete fairly with other non-emitting sources of power. “Today’s budget represents a significant change in how the Federal government is approaching nuclear power in Canada,” said John Gorman, President and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Association. “No longer are we simply ‘on the table’ as Prime Minister Trudeau put it one year ago; nuclear is now recognized as a fundamental and necessary component of Canada’s low carbon energy system.” A new 15% refundable Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for Clean Electricity was introduced that can be applied to all sizes of nuclear power, including small modular reactors (SMRs), large builds, and new refurbishment projects. This ITC will be available to both public and privately owned entities, a decision made in response to a concern raised by the CNA repeatedly over the last few months regarding the applicability of tax credits to crown corporations. This tax credit will also be available for equipment enabling the transmission of electricity between provinces and territories. This ITCE is separate from the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit introduced by Minister Freeland in the 2022 Federal Budget and further detailed in the 2022 Fall Economic Statement. The Clean Technology ITC will provide a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. Today’s budget has also announced an 30% Investment Tax Credit for Clean Technology Manufacturing for manufacturing of clean technologies and the extraction, processing, or recycling of critical minerals. This new credit includes manufacturing of nuclear energy equipment and processing or recycling of nuclear fuels. Nuclear power is also being supported through: •	Extension of the Reduced Tax Rate for Zero-Emission Technology Manufacturers to include the nuclear power sector, including fuel reprocessing and heavy water treatment •	An additional $20 billion being granted to Canada Infrastructure Bank for accelerating the energy transition, including up to $10 billion in clean power, and a further $10 billion in green infrastructure •	Increased budget of $1.3 billion to increase efficiencies with regulatory reviews and approvals, including for the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, Impact Assessment Agency, and others •	The Canada Growth Fund will partner with the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, enabling it to attract private capital to Canada’s clean economy •	Providing $500 million over ten years to the Strategic Innovation Fund, which has supported SMR projects in the past, including by Moltex, Westinghouse, and Terrestrial Energy In addition, the budget provides support for a broad range of initiatives aimed at accelerating Canada’s clean energy transition, particularly through electrification of those sectors that are currently reliant on fossil fuels, including transportation, buildings, and industry, and the production of hydrogen. Today’s budget follows a series of joint statements over the last week that recognized and promoted the key role of nuclear in the global energy transition. In their joint statement released last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden highlighted the need to accelerate cooperation on critical clean energy opportunities and supply chains, including advanced and conventional nuclear energy. This was followed by a joint statement by the Natural Resources Canada and the US Department of Energy, which provided more details on potential areas of coordination and cooperation. Today’s budget reinforces these statements by specifying policies that will enable and foster such cross-border cooperation, moving us from a paradigm of competition toward an integrated and mutually-beneficial North American nuclear ecosystem. The Canadian nuclear industry is encouraged by the Government’s commitment to nuclear playing an increasingly significant role in the country’s energy mix. While additional steps must be taken to ensure that all clean energy technologies receive equal and fair treatment, today’s budget is a significant step to ensuring that Canada remain a global leader in the advancement of this critically important clean energy technology.

Nuclear Power in Canada Nuclear plants have been powering Canadian grids since the 1960s, but Canada has been involved in nuclear science and technology from the beginning. Canadian Nuclear Labs at Chalk River, Ontario, has been designing, building and experimenting with nuclear reactors since the Second World War. Canada has been using and refining its nuclear fleet ever since and has developed a strong industry with highly skilled people. Canadian Nuclear Labs continues to do world-class research on how our nuclear science and technology can save and improve the lives of people around the globe. Current energy mix in Canada Nuclear power from Canada’s 19 nuclear reactors work with renewable sources like hydroelectricity to generate more than three-quarters of Canada’s electricity grid carbon emission free. Nuclear energy is clean, reliable and affordable Nuclear energy is vital to building a clean, low-carbon future. Prominent scientists and environmentalists agree that nuclear power is one of the few reliable energy sources that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The world’s current use of nuclear power already reduces emissions by about 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by avoiding fossil fuels. As nuclear power improves its partnership with other low-carbon sources, it will continue to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Nuclear power stations are the workhorses of the power grid. Because they constantly work, they provide continuous and reliable electricity production, which allows for the expansion of other forms of power generation that operate more intermittently. Nuclear power is cost-competitive with other forms of electricity generation because fuel costs are low and stable, and make up a small proportion of the total cost of nuclear power. Nuclear energy can enable renewables Nuclear power, working with wind and solar, will allow us to create clean, carbon-free electricity grids. Electricity on the grid must be used immediately after it is created, so this partnership meets our power needs when the sun isn’t shining, and the wind is not blowing. Canada’s nuclear reactors provide baseload power , which ensures a steady amount of electricity to the grid, allowing room for renewables to operate in response to changing demand for electricity. The coming nuclear reactor designs have improved capability for load following, that is, they will respond to changing electricity demand throughout the day. This would enable nuclear power to work even more efficiently with renewables, making it unnecessary to burn fossil fuels to make up the difference between electricity supply and demand. These exciting advancements are essential to fighting climate change. SMR potential in Canada Canada has always been a leader in nuclear science and technology and is well positioned to continue to be a global leader in developing and deploying small modular reactors (SMR). With more than 60 years of science and technology innovation, a world-class regulator and a solid domestic supply chain, Canada’s nuclear industry is poised to capture a significant share of the emerging global market, which is estimated to be $150 billion per year by 2040.

Climate Climate change may be the greatest challenge of the 21st century. As the only readily expandable, low-carbon energy source that can provide a reliable and affordable source of electricity, nuclear power stands ready to meet the climate challenge. Climate goals The fight against climate change is simple but not easy. Humanity must stop pouring greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. There is a carbon budget of emissions. To have a 50 per cent chance of keeping global warming under 1.5 °C, we can pour up to 580 gigatonnes more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels creates about 37 gigatonnes per year. The time is short to increase our supply of carbon-free energy like nuclear, solar and wind power. As part of the Paris Agreement, countries around the world committed to limit their total carbon emissions. If kept, these should keep us within the carbon budget. But they aren’t. For example, Germany has had to increase its fossil fuel use because of the closure of nuclear power plants. China is massively increasing coal-fired electricity generation. Even Canada is not on track to meeting its target of reducing carbon emissions by 30 per cent between 2005 and 2030. Greening the energy mix There are three main strategies for staying in the carbon budget. The first is to reduce energy use, which has met with some success. The second is to capture carbon, which is being done in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. Neither of these strategies comes close to ushering in a carbon-neutral future. We must green our energy mix as well as be as efficient with our energy use as possible and try to capture carbon dioxide. The world must replace fossil fuels with low- and zero-emission sources of energy generation. 1.	Solar, wind, and tidal power have seen great advances in the past decade, bringing prices down. However, they are still limited, making up only two per cent of Canada’s total power generation. 2.	Hydroelectric power is a zero-emission option that Canada has used extensively. A limited number of locations are appropriate for damming. The geography has to be right, and the extensive amount of land to be flooded cannot be already claimed or populated. Canada is already near 90 per cent of its hydro capacity. 3.	Nuclear power does not emit any greenhouse gases in its operation. It is readily expandable as Canada has an abundant supply of uranium and does not require nearly the land footprint of hydroelectric power, wind farms or solar arrays. Possible sites for nuclear power plants are plentiful, meaning there’s more that can be done with nuclear power to fight climate change. Any informed look at carbon emissions must look at the total life cycle, including construction, the supply chain, operation, decommissioning and disposal. When all these steps are taken into account, nuclear power compares favourably with renewable energy sources and is well ahead of fossil fuels. According to the World Nuclear Association, the world’s 445 reactors are saving 2.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year. Future reactors will be able to save even more. The Ontario example France and Sweden have used nuclear power to green their electricity grids substantially, but there is also an example in Canada. Until the 1990s, Ontario relied heavily on burning coal for its electrical power. This was a major source of emissions, which stood at 179 megatonnes (CO2 equivalent) in 1990 and reached a maximum of 208 megatonnes in 2000. However, having 18 of Canada’s nuclear power reactors gave the province the flexibility to eliminate coal from its energy mix by 2014. This switchover not only led to substantially cleaner air in the province, but it also reduced carbon emissions sharply. According to the Ontario Auditor General, emissions in the province were 161 megatonnes in 2016, despite a 30 per cent growth in the population since 1990.

CTA: New Fed Pilot a Good Start, But More Needed to Protect Workers in Trucking  Wednesday August 09, 2023 |  Admin & Tax, Labour/HR/Driver Shortage, News Releases The Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA) lauded an announcement this week to establish a Recognized Employer Pilot (REP) aimed at addressing labour shortages and protecting employees such as Temporary Foreign Workers (TFW) from workplace abuse. However, the Alliance urges Ottawa to do more – and demands the Government of Canada to specifically crack down on employers in the trucking sector who operate under the corrosive scheme known as Driver Inc, which robs truck drivers of their rights under the Labour Code. The three-year pilot, announced by Randy Boissonnault, the newly-named Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages, is set to begin this September. CTA, which has been requesting a shift in a similar direction for the TFW program, says the introduction of REP is a positive step to begin addressing labour shortages and reducing red tape for recognized employers. However, the pilot’s effectiveness in protecting foreign workers from abuse in the trucking sector will rely upon the criteria being used to qualify as a recognized employer, and must be supported by a rigorous audit and oversight regime to ensure its intended outcomes are achieved. “The trucking industry, like many sectors of the economy, has a significant labour shortage, and the need to recruit more Canadians and foreign workers to our sector remains imperative,” said CTA President Stephen Laskowski. “Today’s announcement will assist the trucking industry and the supply chain in stabilizing the distribution networks of multiple sectors of our domestic economy.” “But access to foreign labour in trucking through the TFW program or other immigration programs should be restricted to a recognized employer program that ensures that labour compliance is strictly adhered to by all participating companies,” he said. “To certify the legitimacy and effectiveness of this program, the Government of Canada must use a robust auditing system that ensures that all firms are complying with the law and workers are protected from scams like Driver Inc.” Entry into REP will allow for a streamlined application process for employers, with Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) validity for 36 months, and recognized status on Canada’s Job Bank to help recruit potential workers, amongst other benefits. It is being reported that the agricultural sector will be allowed to participate in the pilot beginning in September 2023, with other sectors following in the New Year. Although CTA has not seen the complete details of how employers will qualify to participate in REP, details following Minister Boissonnault’s news conference indicated that employers must have received at least three positive LMIAs for the same occupation within the past five years from a list of designated occupations and supported by the Canadian Occupational Projection System (COPS) data. “CTA has already submitted a plan to work with the federal government to create a recognized employer program for the trucking sector that factors in labour compliance audits, which ensures foreign and domestic workers are being protected from the Driver Inc. scam, which robs them of their rights. CTA believes this new pilot program is an excellent opportunity to introduce these measures in this pilot for our sector.”

Alberta’s Wray Ranch receive prestigious national environmental stewardship award August 17, 2023 Calgary, AB – The Canadian Cattle Association (CCA) is pleased to announce Wray Ranch, located near Irricana, Alberta, as the recipient of The Environmental Stewardship Award (TESA) for 2023. Doug and Linda Wray, who own and operate Wray Ranch in partnership with their nephew, Tim Wray and his wife Joanne, are recognized for their focus on sustainable practices to enhance soil health and reduce erosion. The ranch underwent a transformation in 1998, when 1,000 acres of cropland were converted into high-legume perennial pasture, enabling year-round grazing practices. With a focus on sustainability, the Wrays continue to actively monitor metrics like soil organic matter to ensure the health of their land and, when needed, they adjust herd size and rent or custom graze additional pastures to maintain the well-being of their pastureland. These efforts help the Wrays weather the impacts of adverse weather such as drought. The Wrays commitment to soil health is evident through conservation tillage, pasture management, bale grazing, and swath grazing, resulting in significant improvements such as increased soil organic matter and reduced erosion. Their dedication extends beyond the ranch, as they actively share their expertise and experience with the broader community through mentoring programs, speaking engagements, on-farm trials, and volunteering efforts. By adopting a balanced management approach and prioritizing the land’s well-being over maximum profit, Wray Ranch exemplifies a model of sustainable and responsible farming practices. The award was presented in-person by Mike Duguid, Co-Chair of CCA’s Environment Committee and Kelleen Tait, National Leader, Livestock and Poultry with MNP, during the Canadian Beef Industry Conference (CBIC). Wray Ranch was one of seven regional nominees from across Canada vying for the national award. “The Wrays fully embrace what it means to be stewards of the land and set a strong example of the care that cattle producers from across Canada take to ensure that the land is left in better condition for the next generation,” said Duguid. “Wray Ranch is a testament to how responsible farming practices can go hand in hand with success and their importance to navigating challenging drought years. Congratulations to all nominees for their outstanding dedication to environmental stewardship and setting a remarkable example for sustainable farming practices across Canada.” Thank you to our Platinum Sponsor, MNP, and our Foundational Partners, Ducks Unlimited Canada, Birds Canada, and the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (CRSB), for supporting this year’s TESA program. CCA would also like to recognize the contributions of our judging committee, Karli Reimer and Kristine Tapley with Ducks Unlimited Canada; Norine Ambrose with Cows & Fish; Doug and Erika Fossen, 2022 TESA recipients; and CCA Environment Committee Co-Chairs Duane Thompson and Mike Duguid, who had the difficult task of selecting this year’s recipient.

OTTAWA, September 16, 2022 – As global competitors vie for dominance in critical net-zero industries where Canada is well-positioned to lead, the country must act urgently to position itself for economic success or risk the jobs and long-term prosperity that Canadians depend on. This was the core message of a media briefing event hosted by Ivey Foundation, a leading foundation focused on supporting Canada’s transition to a net-zero economy, which took place yesterday in Ottawa. The event featured a panel of net-zero policy experts and industry association leaders who highlighted the threat to the long-term competitiveness of major Canadian industries if urgent action isn’t taken. The briefing drew attention to the need for increased media coverage and a national conversation on this pressing issue. "The climate crisis has rightfully received ample media attention in recent years, raising awareness of extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and the need to achieve our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets," said panel moderator Bruce Lourie, President, Ivey Foundation. "We are shining a light on an equally urgent matter – the threat to Canada's economy and competitiveness if we fail to seize the opportunities in the net-zero industries of the future." The expert panel highlighted industrial competitiveness as central to Canada's transition to a net-zero economy; along with the need for collaborative planning among governments, industry, investors, Indigenous peoples and other stakeholders. "Canada’s trading partners and competitors are using industrial strategies to position their economies in net-zero supply chains where Canada could lead,” said Bentley Allan, Research Director at The Transition Accelerator and Associate Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University. “Canada has what it takes to prosper in the global net-zero economy, but we must act now and take a strategic approach to align climate objectives with economic growth and diversification.” “Industrial competitiveness must be a key consideration of Canada’s climate strategy as we transition to a net zero economy. Canada must recognize the urgency by creating the best possible investment climate through incentives, predictable requirements, and affordable clean energy sources,” said Catherine Cobden, President and CEO, Canadian Steel Producers Association. “It is also imperative that we address the significant amount of carbon intensive steel coming into Canada on a daily basis. Canada’s steel industry produces the greenest steel in the world, but we cannot remain competitive if carbon leakage continues at today’s pace.” “Canada has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a zero-emission vehicle industry, re-envisioning our industrial future," said Matthew Fortier, President and CEO, Accelerate. "Now is the time for industry and government to frame the strategic approach together, setting out economic and job targets in the mining, battery and manufacturing sectors and laying out action and investment plans to meet those targets. Getting this right will mean securing Canada's future in the global zero-emission vehicle industry.” The media briefing event also provided media with an opportunity to connect with some of Canada’s leading voices on the transition to a net-zero economy from organizations such as Canadian Climate Institute, The Transition Accelerator, Efficiency Canada, Institute for Sustainable Finance, Smart Prosperity Institute, National Farmers Union, Accelerate, Canada’s Zero-Emission Vehicle Supply Chain Alliance and SeedChange. A list of top net-zero economy experts available for media interviews on topics including climate policy, electrification and grid integration, the zero-emission vehicle supply chain, low-carbon hydrogen, sustainable finance, sustainable agriculture and more is now available in the Media Centre on Ivey Foundation’s website. This resource also features the latest news, releases and events related to the transition to a net-zero economy.

Green procurement could boost Canada-U.S. relations Canadian politicians of every stripe now regularly state that a strong economy and a healthy environment can go hand-in-hand. At the same time, the pandemic has led to significant new commitments by governments across the country to increase infrastructure spending, often with a call to “build back better” and greener. This has raised the important question of the role public procurement can play in meeting both our economic and environmental objectives. Last month, the C.D. Howe Institute hosted a policy seminar, in which leaders from labour, industry, government, and environmental groups were invited to discuss procurement solutions that benefit our economy, jobs, and climate. Consensus can be hard to build, but we hope this collaboration shows policymakers that sensible solutions are at the ready, and the need for political leadership is now. One key solution is “green procurement”: procuring goods and services that have a smaller carbon footprint. Governments around the world now have the opportunity to include it in their plans to rebuild their economies from the devastation of the pandemic. With many Canadian commodities being among the greenest in the world — including steel, because relatively little carbon is used and emitted in its production — it’s worth considering a system that prioritizes, even normalizes, green public procurement. We believe that doing so will help advance the ambitious climate objectives that are crucial to Canada’s net-zero transformation in the coming years. Not only would implementing a robust and green procurement framework help to dramatically reduce emissions and reach net neutrality, which governments in Canada have promised to do so publicly, it could also strengthen the economic and environmental partnerships between Canada and the United States. The Biden administration has explicitly tied fighting climate change to creating good union jobs. Both the steel sector’s low carbon emissions, and the good, unionized jobs it provides, should give Canadian-made steel a clear advantage in U.S. plans. Our two countries remain each other’s most important trading partners, with deep integration across supply chains and organized labour. We also share a vision for the climate. There is consensus among us all that more must be done to tangibly take the significant opportunity in front of us. It’s the main focus of the Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership, which Prime Minister Trudeau and President Joe Biden launched earlier this year in the interest of advancing their countries’ mutual prosperity. And while Canada and the U.S. did launch a Greening Government Initiative in April, Canadian officials need to pursue a deeper dialogue with their American colleagues about green procurement in order to strengthen supply chains and protect our strategic advantage, as well as to create and maintain community-sustaining jobs in both countries. For our part, industry and labour groups across the economy are ready to contribute to collective efforts on green procurement. We call on our governments to act on this opportunity and advance necessary progress, knowing it’s a national imperative if we want to ensure long-term competitiveness and success. We also do so because we realize that our national economic and environmental commitments are a culmination of our own pledges, be they the Canadian Steel Producers Association members’ aspirational goal to achieve net zero by 2050, or the United Steelworkers’ participation in Blue Green Canada, which advocates for working people and the environment by promoting solutions to environmental problems that also benefit the economy and create good jobs. We are eager for a new vision of green public procurement, because we have an incredible opportunity now, but also an obligation to future generations to leave no stone unturned in the fight against climate change.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a Game Changer for Canada’s Climate and Energy Security March 7, 2023  | Canadian Fuels Association, Economy, Energy, Environment, Lower Carbon Future, Policy, Renewable Energy Canada has everything it takes to be a global leader in low-carbon transportation fuels – energy infrastructure, sustainable feedstocks and expertise – everything except for a competitive investment climate with the U.S. The North American fuels market is highly integrated and Canada competes with the U.S. for investment. For over two decades, the U.S. has been implementing robust programs, such as tax credits, to attract investment in clean fuels. This has resulted in strong, clean fuels production capacity in the U.S., and Canada becoming more reliant on clean fuel imports. Canadian Fuels Association (CFA) members are some of the largest producers of clean fuels today and, since 2020, members have been steadfast in their commitment to produce more clean fuels in Canada. Then came the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) last summer, doubling down with a suite of new clean fuel production measures; including new, generous Production Tax Credits (PTC) for low-carbon road transportation fuels and sustainable aviation fuel. This PTC is a complete game changer, dramatically tipping project economics in favour of clean fuel projects in the U.S. The PTC will also result in more Canadian-grown feedstocks being exported to the U.S., translating into significant, lost economic benefits to Canada and undermining our energy self-sufficiency. And the timing could not be worse. CFA members have plans to implement large-scale renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen and ethanol projects – highlighting their commitment to clean fuels and support for Canada’s climate goals as we continue  Driving to 2050. These projects, worth $8B and with the potential to deliver 10 MT of GHG reductions from coast-to-coast, are awaiting final investment decisions; but companies are re-evaluating the business case for building in Canada. Just last Friday, Parkland discontinued plans for a stand-alone renewable diesel facility in Burnaby, B.C., citing the IRA as a key factor. This means that without investment parity, there is a growing concern that more of these projects are at risk of being delayed or being built in the U.S. Parkland’s decision reinforces the need for an urgent response by the Government of Canada, and that is why we are calling for the introduction of a Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in Budget 2023. This would apply to all clean fuels produced in Canada, including ethanol, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen and provide the required investment certainty. Like the U.S., the credit rate would vary according to carbon intensity, meaning the higher the GHG reductions achieved, the higher the credit value. The economic and climate benefits of clean fuel production in Canada would extend throughout the value chain, from agricultural and forestry feedstock providers to distribution, while decreasing our reliance on imports and creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs for Canadians. We cannot risk losing these added economic and climate benefits for Canada. In a recent speech, Environment and Climate Change Minister Stephen Guilbeault said “The Inflation Reduction Act removes any doubt that we can stick with the status quo. It has made the rush for innovation in clean tech more competitive than ever”. Our transportation energy sector has been pivotal to Canada’s economic success for over a century. We have an opportunity to be a world leader in terms of clean fuel production while meeting Canadians’ evolving energy needs and climate goals. Budget 2023 is a critical juncture. We must respond to the IRA or be left behind at the expense of our economy, energy and climate security.

Aluminium Stewardship Initiative holds second AGM in Montreal, confirms progress to certification program launch at year end 8 April 2017 Responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminium took another decisive step forward this week, when over 80 representatives from aluminium producers, users, civil society, associations, government and other stakeholders came together at the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative’s (ASI) Annual General Meeting (AGM). The event was held on Tuesday 4 April at the Centre for Sustainable Development in Montreal, Canada and was supported by the Government of Quebec, Rio Tinto and the Aluminium Association of Canada. The event included formal AGM proceedings for members and a public program that included keynote speakers Steven Guilbeault (Co-founder and Senior Director of Equiterre), Chris Coulter (CEO and Board Member of Globescan) and Michael Liebreich (Chairman of the Advisory Board and Founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance). These keynotes highlighted several challenges that initiatives such as ASI face on the route to acceptance and successful implementation, as well as future trends, particularly in energy, which could be used to inspire the development and improve the relevance of ASI’s standards program. ASI Directors formed a panel to discuss ASI’s strategic direction and what success would look like from different stakeholder perspectives. Views from civil society, industrial users and upstream producers all underscored the expected benefits of the ASI standards to their sectors that would be attainable after five years of implementation. ASI CEO, Dr Fiona Solomon, provided an overview of how ASI is designing and delivering its program to achieve impact. She emphasised how ASI can contribute to how ASI can contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the collective actions of its members. ASI’s standards address a wide range of the SDGs, including ‘responsible consumption and production’, and ‘partnerships for the goals’, among others. Two parallel streams in the afternoon gave insights into ASI’s standards and intended impacts: the first via an overview of ASI’s program and a panel of ASI members providing perspectives on what it can deliver. For example, primary metal producers and downstream transformers of aluminium see the ASI as a licence to grow the production, transformation and use of aluminium in a responsible way in the future, while creating wealth and overall economic, social and environmental benefits for society as a whole. National Aluminium Associations stated their wish to be empowered to assist local aluminium ecosystems during the implementation phase to ensure proper membership alignment, public policy coherence and adequate assistance to downstream businesses in their respective regions of the world. The second parallel stream took an in-depth look at the results and feedback coming from prior consultations on ASI’s standards and assurance model. Attendees enjoyed a local treat of snow with locally tapped maple syrup at an ‘urban sugar shack’ set up on site. The day closed with a cocktail reception with VIP guests from the Government of Quebec, as well as representatives from the Consulate General Britain, Russia, and France. The AGM event is a major milestone in a broad scope of activities ASI will be undertaking through the remainder of 2017 to finalise the development of its program.

NANAIMO, B.C. – Canada Post today unveiled its first depot using battery-electric corporate delivery vehicles, reinforcing the company’s commitment to electrify its last mile fleet and help build a sustainable future for Canadians. The company’s Nanaimo depot will use 14 fully electric cargo vans for collection and delivery services, replacing internal combustion vehicles. As part of Canada Post's plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the company has committed to electrifying half of its national fleet of approximately 14,000 vehicles by 2030 and the entire fleet by 2040. Doug Ettinger, President and CEO of Canada Post, and Suromitra Sanatani, Chair of the Board of Directors, were on site to announce the depot’s official launch of its electric delivery vehicles. A stronger, greener Canada “Last year, the Corporation set aside more than $1 billion to cut emissions and move forward on the electrification of its last mile fleet. This critical investment has led to important progress on Canada Post’s plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,” said Ms. Sanatani. “Canadians expect their postal service to play a leading role in the country’s transition to a low-carbon future. It’s a responsibility that Canada Post embraces.” “Over Canada Post’s long history, the postal service has always evolved to meet the changing needs of Canadians and businesses,” Mr. Ettinger said. “Our transformation plan invests billions of dollars into service, capacity and greening our operations – because we need to deliver for Canadians, whether that’s shipping parcels or helping to build a more sustainable future. When you look at the size of our network, this depot may be a small first step, but it’s an important one as we start to build momentum.” Sustainable delivery Canada Post has committed to a science-based target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The Corporation is retrofitting its facilities, constructing new net-zero carbon buildings, and sourcing renewable energy for its real estate and operations. The Albert Jackson Processing Centre, its leading-edge parcel sorting facility in Scarborough, Ontario, will operate as net zero and have the capacity to process more than a million packages a day. Canada Post is building on decades of experience experimenting with electric and other low-emission vehicles. Now in the preliminary stage of its fleet electrification, the Corporation is introducing vehicles at select plants and depots to evaluate what equipment, charging infrastructure and approaches are best suited to its operational needs. The company has also been testing other innovative, sustainable delivery options. These include e-cargo trikes, which can travel using bike paths, and a compact, low-speed electric cargo vehicle appropriate for some neighbourhood delivery routes. Canada Post will be going to market to compete for new vehicles in a variety of classes.

Afghanistan's health system suffers critical underfunding, calls for donor support 18 August 2023 Launched today by the World Health Organization (WHO), a new Alert underscores the crucial importance of ramping up investment in healthcare services provision in Afghanistan, particularly in the underserved areas where the healthcare infrastructure is severely under-resourced and remain vulnerable due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis. After decades of instability, exacerbated by severe drought and natural disasters, Afghanistan is currently facing a prolonged humanitarian crisis, with millions of people living with poor or no access to health and food, putting them at a severe risk of malnutrition and disease outbreaks. The vulnerability of women and girls has further intensified, as they face increased obstacles in accessing healthcare due to the ban on education and workforce participation. The revised Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan for 2023 reveals an alarming increase in the number of people in urgent need of humanitarian aid. As per the plan, 28.8 million people in Afghanistan require immediate assistance, up from 18.4 million prior to August 2021. To address the health emergency, 14 million people, including 7.5 million children and 3.1 million women, are currently targeted for health assistance, out of which 8.4 million have already been reached in the first six months of 2023. The healthcare response has been commendable, with a total of 25.7 million healthcare services provided between 2022 and 2023. However, despite these efforts and without sufficient funding, 8 million people in Afghanistan will lose access to essential and potentially lifesaving health assistance, and 450,000 patients will have little to no access to life-saving trauma care services, including blood transfusions and referrals. In addition, an estimated 1.6 million people with mental health conditions will have little to no access to mental health consultation and psychosocial support. The WHO Alert highlights the dire consequences that will result if underfunding continues in Afghanistan's healthcare system. The health sector is facing significant barriers to delivering holistic services to the Afghan people, especially women and children, resulting in fragmentation and increased vulnerability, particularly in underserved areas. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, stated: "The situation in Afghanistan is grave, and the lack of resources and funding to support health workers and facilities is putting countless lives at risk. Women and children are suffering the most. I call on donors to give generously so that we can continue our life-saving work”. Dr Ahmed Al Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, urged the international community to unite with WHO to help tackle the ongoing humanitarian health crisis in Afghanistan. He said, "It is our collective responsibility to act now to support the Afghan healthcare system. The consequences of inaction are catastrophic and may leave a lasting impact on the health and well-being of the Afghan people." Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO Representative to Afghanistan, expressed concern about the underfunding of the health system and emphasized the need for immediate action, while also taking the opportunity to extend his appreciation to partners. He said, "The situation in Afghanistan is critical, and it demands urgent attention. For a country already affected by decades of conflict, underfunding of the healthcare system is a critical humanitarian concern. The consequences of this underfunding cannot be overstated. I want to thank our current partners who have provided support thus far, but also to call on them to redouble their efforts”. In the second half of 2023, WHO will continue working with its outstanding partners to tackle critical health emergencies by providing life-saving health interventions, while simultaneously building on the successes observed in 2022. Much work still needs to be done to deliver on WHO’ strategic areas; Protecting people every day; Reaching everyone, everywhere, and putting mothers and children first; Leading the health sector by coordinating the health partners, and drive impact in delivering effective health services in Afghanistan.

Global partners commit to advance evidence-based traditional, complementary and integrative medicine 19 August 2023 The first-ever World Health Organization (WHO) Traditional Medicine Global Summit 2023 closed on 18 August, with a strong commitment from the diverse and unique groups of partners and stakeholders to harness the potential of the evidence-based traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) to improve progress towards universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 for the health and well-being of people and the planet. Health ministers from G20 and other countries, scientists, practitioners of traditional medicine, health workers and members of civil society from 88 countries participated in the Summit that took place in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India on 17 and 18 August 2023. The Summit provided a platform for all stakeholders to share their unique experiences, best practices and ideas for collaboration. It included a diverse group of Indigenous Peoples from different regions of the world (e.g. Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Guatemala and New Zealand, among others) for whom many TCIM approaches play a fundamental role in not just health care, but also culture and livelihoods. Building evidence and innovations Preliminary findings from the WHO Global Survey on Traditional Medicine 2023 shared at the Summit indicate that around 100 countries have TCIM related national policies and strategies.  In many WHO Member States, TCIM treatments are part of the essential medicine lists, essential health service packages, and are covered by national health insurance schemes.  A large majority of people seek traditional, complementary and integrative medicine interventions for treatment, prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases, palliative care and rehabilitation. Dr Bruce Aylward, Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage, Life Course at WHO, highlighted the need for a “stronger evidence base—a WHO priority—to enable countries to develop appropriate regulations and policies around traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine.” The Summit also highlighted the important role that artificial intelligence can play to mine complex data available on traditional medicine and identify practices that show promise for further scientific evaluation. Eventually, and with ethical and equity safeguards, this evidence can translate into policies that accelerate the safe and effective use of traditional medicine into health systems. Fostering collective action for healthier planet for healthier people In closing the Summit, Dr Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe said, “Together, we have gently shaken up the status quo that has, for far too long, separated different approaches to medicine and health. By taking aim at silos, we are saying we will collaborate all the more to find optimal ways to bring traditional, complementary and integrative medicine well under the umbrella of primary health care and universal health coverage.”  He further added, “We have reiterated how crucial it is to get better evidence on the effectiveness, safety and quality of traditional and complementary medicine. That means innovative methodologies for assessing and evaluating outcomes.” Dr Shyama Kuruvilla, Senior Strategic Adviser and lead for the WHO Traditional Medicine Global Centre, who also led the organization of the Summit said, “We learnt much about the existing policies, tools and practices. But it is clear we have a long journey ahead in using science to further understand, develop and deliver the full potential of TCIM approaches to improve people’s health and well-being in harmony with the planet that sustains us.” The Summit’s summary document included conclusions and commitments from participants on wide-ranging issues, from global policy, leadership, innovation, health workforce, data, evidence, monitoring, regulation, legal frameworks and protecting biodiversity and sustainable development.

WHO launches a new global Initiative on digital health supported by the G20 Presidency 19 August 2023 News release The World Health Organization (WHO) and the G20 India presidency announced a new Global Initiative on Digital Health (GIDH) today at the Health Minister’s Meeting of the G20 Summit hosted by the Government of India. The new GIDH initiative (pronounced “guide” for short) will operate as a WHO-managed network and platform to support the implementation of the Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020–2025. WHO serves as the Secretariat for the strategy implementation to converge and convene global standards, best practices and resources to fast track digital health system transformation. “We thank the G20 countries and the India G20 Presidency for recognizing WHO’s unique role and strengths in this area and supporting the establishment of the new GIDH network,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Continued support and collaboration of the G20, development partners and international organizations will be necessary to accomplish together what none of us can do alone. WHO is committed to working with countries to strengthen their capacities and to improve access to quality-assured digital solutions for a healthier, safer, fairer future.” Speaking at the launch, India’s Union Health Minister Dr Mansukh Mandaviya said, “Today was a momentous day in the history of the G20 Health Working Group, wherein G20 countries not only identified a priority for its relevance but collectively worked towards its launch.” The new Global Initiative on Digital Health is one of the key deliverables of India’s G20 Presidency. Since the first WHO resolution on e-health in 2005 that led the pathway for development and adoption of the WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health, over 120 WHO Member States have developed a national digital health policy or strategy. While recent experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a boost in digital health use, many countries express the need for support to move from product-focused and pilot digital health initiatives to establishing national digital health infrastructure with appropriate governance, policy and a competent health workforce needed to select, maintain and adapt digital health interventions. The GIDH initiative aims to bring countries and partners together to achieve measurable outcomes by: 1.	developing clear priority-driven investment plans for digital health transformation; 2.	improving reporting and transparency of digital health resources; 3.	facilitating knowledge exchange and collaboration across regions and countries to accelerate progress; 4.	supporting whole-of-government approaches for digital health governance in countries; and 5.	increasing technical and financial support to the implementation of the Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020–2025 and its next phase. WHO and partners announced substantial commitments in cash and kind from multiple stakeholders to support the launch of this new Initiative. Digital health is a proven accelerator to advance health outcomes towards achieving Universal Health Coverage and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Digital health interventions improve health care in many ways, from supporting individuals in managing their health and wellness journeys, to enabling care providers to adhere to guidelines and provide high quality care, to strengthening health systems by improving supply chains and workforce management.

Investing in global health: A common objective 23 June 2023 In 2015, world leaders committed to providing health services for all people by 2030. In 2023, the world is only halfway towards meeting the target set by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of achieving universal health coverage by 2030. More effort, from implementation to investment in health, is needed to meet this globally agreed goal. Consider some figures. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that low- and middle-income countries needed to increase their health spending significantly to reach the health-related SDGs, with an additional US$371 billion annually combined required by 2030. This funding would allow populations to access health services, contribute to building new facilities and train and place health workers where they need to be. Lately, however, a host of additional factors are increasing the need for additional funding to achieve universal health coverage, such as disruptions to health services caused by conflict, climate change and economic instability. It has also been estimated that preparing for future pandemics will require massive investment in the order of US$31.1 billion annually, with approximately one-third required from international financing. Temporary increases in government spending driven up by the pandemic response contributed a rise on global health spending in the neighbourhood of $9 trillion in 2020. That is nearly 11% of gross domestic product. Public spending accounted for about 63% of this amount. While public spending will remain the main source of health funding, it will be difficult for countries to find the funds required to meet the ambitious goal of universal health coverage. At the same time, the world economy is under strain, as are national budgets. Development assistance will also likely feel the squeeze. Health services need new sources of funding, and innovative products that can help marshal the resources of the private sector. The challenge is enormous. Individual countries cannot solve the health care conundrum on their own. We need global solidarity and collective efforts. For this reason, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Islamic Development Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) are launching a new investment platform to mobilize more impactful and coherent investments to primary health care (PHC) systems in individual countries and to improve countries’ resilience. We are also channeling resources from other partners, such as the European Commission, to remove the risk from these investments and to make the conditions highly attractive for beneficiary countries. As this is a global challenge, the Inter-American Development Bank, the leading source of development finance for Latin America and the Caribbean, is also considering joining this partnership in view to extending this initiative to the region. Why focus on primary health care? Around 90% of essential health services can be delivered through quality primary health care that is closer to communities, via health professionals, doctors and nurses, in local clinics to promote health and prevent diseases. This will avert the need for more costly secondary and tertiary services. Essentially, primary health care reaches even the most rural and remote locations, and also serves as the "eyes and ears" of a country’s health system. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis taught us that investing in health services that can reach all is central to national security, development and prosperity. It also reminded us that solidarity and equity are integral parts of any health service solution. Cooperation between multilateral organizations and development banks are key to addressing these challenges. We will focus on driving measurable impact in people’s health outcomes by using innovative finance mechanisms to spur domestic funding and contribute to promoting our shared goal of health for all, without pushing countries into unsustainable debt. We will launch this new investment platform in Paris at the Summit on a New Global Financing Pact (22-23 June, 2023), with a call to generate needed finances to fight inequalities in health and other fields, to finance the climate transition, and to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. Good health and well-being are common goals that the whole world shares. To achieve such goals, however, countries and institutions must work together. As we strengthen our collaboration, we are convinced that cooperation – between nations, as well as between governments and the private sector – is critical to achieving universal health coverage. We call on our partners to join this global investment platform.

Donors making a difference: Honouring the humanitarian heroes around the world 18 August 2023 This World Humanitarian Day, we honour the heroes of humanitarian crises across the world: those who are first on the ground and at the forefront of every disaster relief, be it in a conflict or following disasters. An increasing number of convergent threats directly impact many people’s access to basic necessities, including healthcare. Humanitarians are often the only line of protection for care, dignity, and hope. WHO joins partners in paying homage to them and their work, delivering no matter what, this year’s theme. WHO proudly joins the campaign led by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) our long-trusted partner, and thank them for its strong leadership and financial support. The World Health Organization launched an appeal for $2.54 billion in February, to continue to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable during this unprecedented moment of intersecting emergencies. Read more about some of WHO's work during this past year in humanitarian emergencies. From reaching isolated populations in Haiti to stop the resurgence of cholera, to tending to the last mile of COVID-19 vaccine delivery in Sierra Leone or the Solomon Islands, to continue the response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Contributions have also helped Türkiye‘s earthquakes response, and to help lift barriers to health and healthcare in difficult to access areas in the occupied Palestinian territory. We thank all our contributors who enable WHO’s response to alleviate suffering and help people thrive. Haiti: Reaching isolated populations on La Gonâve Island after a resurgence of cholera After Haiti’s West Department experienced a resurgence of cholera, making it the epicenter of the outbreak in October 2022. PAHO/WHO worked with local authorities to coordinate a logistical operation and strengthen patient care facilities on the island, particularly in the communes of Pointe à Raquette and Anse à Galets. To ensure the rapid delivery of emergency medical supplies and equipment, PAHO/WHO looked for partners to speed up the response and signed a memorandum of understanding with the NGO Humanité Inclusion and its Mer Logistique et Urgence Haiti (MERLUH) project. Thanks to MERLUH’s fleet, "we were able to rapidly deploy more than 6 tonnes of equipment and medicines essential for the management and treatment of cholera cases on the island," said Jude Romain, the Health Logistics Technician for the health emergency programme at the PAHO/WHO office in Haiti. Read more Sierra Leone: the last mile of COVID-19 vaccine delivery Sierra Leone, a coastal nation in the West African tropics, was well on the path to recovery from a hard bout with Ebola Viral Disease from 2014-2016 when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Medical care was still hard to access in large parts of the country. While Sierra Leone was one of the first western African nations to receive COVID-19 vaccines—beginning its vaccine rollout in March 2021—by March 2022, Sierra Leone had only 14 % of its population vaccinated. The community nurses and mobilizers in Bombali, as in other parts of the country, worked relentlessly to reach remote communities and villages. Nurses Kai and Koroma from the Masselleh Community Health Post, had to travel 20 kilometers over rugged, dirt roads from the regional city of Makeni to deliver the vaccines to the people that needed them. In the Solomon Islands, many rivers to cross It takes two days’ journey at least from Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, to reach the mountain village of Kuvamiti to provide and deliver routine health care and immunization for the people who live and work there. Nurse Rosemary Raikekeni runs the health clinic in Totongo on the coast of Guadalcanal, six bumpy hours’ drive from the capital. It is the nearest permanent clinic for many villages in the far interior of the island. It is two hours by Land Cruiser to Kuvamiti village—if there are no landslides, and the rivers are all open for crossing or otherwise many hours’ walk. In January 2022, WHO, UNICEF and Gavi established the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership to intensify support to COVID-19 vaccine delivery.

WHO launches “One life, one liver” campaign on World Hepatitis Day 28 July 2023 To mark World Hepatitis Day, WHO is calling for scaling up testing and treatment for viral hepatitis, warning that the disease could kill more people than malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV combined by 2040, if current infection trends continue. Hepatitis causes liver damage and cancer and kills over a million people annually. Of the 5 types of hepatitis infections, hepatitis B and C cause most of the disease and deaths. Hepatitis C can be cured; however, only 21% of people living with hepatitis C infection are diagnosed and only 13% have received curative treatment. Just 10% of people living with chronic hepatitis B are diagnosed, and only 2% of those infected are receiving the lifesaving medicine. Under the theme of “One life, one liver”, WHO’s World Hepatitis Day campaign highlights the importance of protecting the liver against hepatitis for living a long, healthy life. Good liver health also benefits other vital organs – including the heart, brain and kidneys – that rely on the liver to function. "Millions of people are living with undiagnosed and untreated hepatitis worldwide, even though we have better tools than ever to prevent, diagnose and treat it," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "WHO remains committed to supporting countries to expand the use of those tools, including increasingly cost-effective curative medication, to save lives and end hepatitis.” WHO will share new guidance to track countries’ progress on the path to the elimination of hepatitis by 2030. To reduce new infections and deaths from hepatitis B and C, countries must: ensure access to treatment for all pregnant women living with hepatitis B, provide hepatitis B vaccines for their babies at birth, diagnose 90% of people living with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, and provide treatment to 80% of all people diagnosed with hepatitis. They must also act to ensure optimal blood transfusion, safe injections and harm reduction. Vaccination, testing and treatment – vital opportunities to protect your liver from hepatitis The reduction of hepatitis B infections in children through vaccination is a key intervention to limit viral hepatitis infections overall. The target for hepatitis B incidence is the only Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDG) health target that was met in 2020 and is on track for 2030. However, many countries in Africa do not have access to the birth dose hepatitis B vaccines. Gavi’s recent restart of its Vaccine Investment Strategy 2018 – which includes the birth dose hepatitis B vaccine – will jumpstart newborn vaccination programmes in west and central Africa, where mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission rates remain very high. To help eliminate mother-to-child transmission, WHO recommends that all pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis B during their pregnancy. If positive, they should receive treatment and vaccines should be provided to their newborns. However, a new WHO report shows that of the 64 countries with a policy, only 32 countries reported implementing activities to screen for and manage hepatitis B in antenatal clinics. The report also shows that of the 103 countries that reported, 80% have policies to screen and manage hepatitis B in HIV clinics, with 65% doing the same for hepatitis C. Increasing hepatitis testing and treatment within HIV programmes will protect people living with HIV from developing liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. After years of increasing treatment rates, the rise in the number of people accessing hepatitis C curative treatment is slowing. WHO advocates for taking advantage of price reductions in medication to reaccelerate progress in expanding treatment. A 12-week course of medication to cure hepatitis C now costs 60 US dollars for low-income countries, down from the original costs of more than 90 000 US dollars when first introduced in high-income countries. Treatment for hepatitis B costs less than 30 US dollars per year ($2.4 US dollars per month). For people who want to maintain liver health, WHO recommends hepatitis testing, treatment if diagnosed, and vaccination against hepatitis B. Reducing alcohol consumption, achieving a healthy weight, and managing diabetes or hypertension also benefit liver health.

Goal of the Month – Decent Work and Economic Growth Sustainable Development Goal 8 is about promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the worst economic crisis in decades and reversed progress on key issues related toward decent work for all. While global economies have slowly bounced back since 2021, recovery still remains elusive and fragile, especially around employment improvement and availability for all. Where are we? As we reach the midpoint-review of the 2030 Agenda, it is clear that multiple crises are placing tremendous pressure on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. According to the 2023 UN World Economic Situations and Prospect Report (WESP), growth momentum weakened in the United states, European Union, and other developed economics, causing rippling effects on the rest of the world. World output growth is projected to decelerate from an estimated 3.0 per cent in 2022 to 1.9 per cent in 2023, marking one of the lowest growth rates in recent decades. Growth in real GDP per capita went from an average annual rate of 1.8 per cent from 2015 to 2019, to a sharp decline in 4.1 per cent in 2020. While it slowly increased by 5.2 per cent in 2022, it is estimated that growth in 2023 will still be slower, falling short of the SDG target of 7 per cent. Global employment opportunities have also been highly impacted, with key issues for women and youth. The UN Secretary General’s 2023 SDGs Report: Special Edition highlights that unemployment rates significantly declined in 2022, with an estimated total global unemployment of 192 million. Furthermore, according to WESP, job recovery in developing countries has been slower with rates notably higher than before the pandemic. Additional factors, such as impacts from climate change, have also created obstacles on countries trying to achieve productive employment and decent work for all. Learn more from this week’s interview on heatwaves and work environments. Global employment opportunities have also been highly impacted, with key issues for women and youth. The UN Secretary General’s 2023 SDGs Report: Special Edition highlights that unemployment rates significantly declined in 2022, with an estimated total global unemployment of 192 million. Furthermore, according to WESP, job recovery in developing countries has been slower with rates notably higher than before the pandemic. Further declines are expected in 2023, but the youth unemployment rate continues to be higher than the rate for adults, highlighting the ongoing challenges in securing opportunities for young people. The pandemic disproportionately affected women and young people in the labour market, and while some recovery was seen, young people aged 15-24 still face difficulties in securing decent employment. Moreover, many young people, especially young women, were not in education, employment, or training in 2022. This is predominant in areas like Central, Southern and Western Asia and Northern Africa. To ensure the achievement of SDG 8, we need a financial system that not only tackles issues in rising debt and economic uncertainty, but also focuses on promoting equitable pay and decent work for all young people.

Tracking Global Financial Stability Risks From Higher Interest Rates Financial-sector assessments are gauging the effects of elevated borrowing costs, and the prospect that central banks may keep policy rates higher for longer than investors expect August 8, 2023 Interest-rate increases by global central banks to contain the biggest inflation outbreak in four decades generated strains for banks in the United States and Europe this year. Rate hikes are generally positive for lenders if they can collect more on lending than they pay depositors, but this time was different. Some banks lost money on bond holdings—even from safe US Treasuries. This rattled some customers, who quickly made withdrawals, amplified by technology and social media. A number of banks failed. Our Financial Sector Assessment Program is a crucial pillar of our surveillance that closely tracks financial stability risks for individual countries and gauges how resilient they may be. FSAPs also assess whether the financial sector supervision, regulation, crisis management tools, and safety nets—like emergency liquidity support and deposit insurance—follow international best practices. FSAPs always “stress test” potential risks to banks, and more recently have enhanced the risk assessment of nonbank financial intermediaries, such as pension managers, insurers, and asset managers. Our work is taking place amid continued central bank interest-rate increases, and the potential for borrowing costs to remain higher for longer than investors, businesses and households expect. This could increase financial stability risks and weigh on growth, as we noted in July. Market volatility and runs Rapid monetary policy tightening could make bond and interest-rate derivatives markets volatile. Even the value of safe US Treasury securities drop by as much as 30 percent when yields go up by 400 basis points—the actual shock to 10-year Treasury note yields since 2020. Before March, we emphasized the risks from such shifts in bond markets to nonbank financial companies. Many of them have large investments in bonds and suffer from valuation losses. Especially, investment funds could face rapid redemptions—runs—as their customers can quickly exit unprofitable funds. Runs are rare for pension and life insurance companies as policyholders must incur penalties with early withdrawal. However, companies that use derivatives and other complex transactions to boost returns may suffer from margin calls as they would be required to provide cash should those instruments lose value—as occurred for some UK pension funds last year. Then, the events in March reminded us of the importance of bank runs. The regulatory reforms after the global financial crisis required banks to hold more cash and bonds. Further, in many countries after the global financial crisis, banks can now borrow more easily from central banks to avoid selling bonds into falling markets. Yet, in the case of the Silicon Valley Bank, these safeguards did not work well. The value of its bond holdings slumped amid rapid monetary tightening, hitting earnings, capital, and cash buffers. Depositors saw these strains and withdrew funds. The bank was not prepared to access central bank liquidity in time and failed, as did other US lenders.

Inflation Remains Risk Confronting Financial Markets Central banks may keep interest rates higher for longer than currently priced; given investors’ benign inflation outlook and growing expectations for a soft landing, this could increase financial stability risks and weigh on growth July 27, 2023 Overall inflation has moderated meaningfully in recent months in the United States and euro area, as energy and food prices have fallen significantly. Year-on-year headline inflation is now around 3 percent in the United States and below 5.5 percent in the euro area. However, core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, has declined more slowly. Services inflation has proven to be particularly sticky. According to market pricing, investors expect headline inflation to continue to decline quite rapidly in coming quarters. However, some market participants still see upside risks to the inflation outlook, likely reflecting recent stickiness in core inflation. Indeed, pricing from inflation options—financial instruments that offer protection against inflation moving higher or lower than its current level—shows that such upside risk is particularly pronounced in Europe, where investors assign roughly similar odds to inflation returning to the European Central Bank’s 2 percent target and inflation remaining around 4 percent. In the United States, investors appear to put high odds on inflation being above target at around 3 percent. At the same time, financial conditions—as proxied by our index that summarizes financing costs faced by firms and households in housing, credit, and equity markets—have eased notably in the United States and euro area in recent quarters. This easing has occurred despite continued monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve and ECB, in part reflecting investors’ relatively benign outlook for price pressures—an assessment that has boosted market valuations. The recent easing creates a challenge for central banks in their efforts to get inflation back to their 2 percent targets. Historically, tighter monetary policy has been transmitted to the real economy, and subsequently to inflation, through tighter financial conditions. While financial conditions are currently tighter than the extremely loose levels seen in mid-2021, the recent easing may complicate the fight against inflation by preventing the slowdown in aggregate demand that may be needed to tamp down inflation pressures. A further complication results from the combination of a prolonged period of extremely loose financial conditions and a monetary policy tightening cycle in advanced economies that started when inflation was already elevated. This may have dulled the transmission of monetary policy to financial conditions. For example, the share of fixed-rate mortgages with low rates (because of refinancings in the past few years) is very high in the United States. Similarly, corporations took advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs and ample liquidity to extend their debt maturities. In both cases, this may have dampened the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, as many mortgage holders and companies have only begun to face higher borrowing costs, thus contributing to the continued strength in labor markets and aggregate demand. Of course, other factors may have played a role, including structural changes in the labor marker or housing markets after the pandemic, for example. While financial condition indices based on financing costs in capital markets have eased, monetary policy transmission also works through credit extension, especially for borrowers more reliant on bank lending. Bank credit growth has remained positive in both the United States and euro area, although the pace of growth has slowed markedly, especially in the latter. More forward-looking information in recent loan officer surveys in both the United States and euro area point to significantly slower demand for credit and tightening underwriting standards by banks, suggesting that a further deceleration in bank credit provision may be in the offing. Recent earnings reports have shown strength at large banks, with earnings boosted by higher interest rates charged on loans while remuneration on deposits continues to lag the pace of policy tightening. Lending survey results, however, suggest that profitability could moderate going forward.

Tuvalu Needs to Build Resilience Amid Threat from Rising Seas By Diego A. Cerdeiro, Roman D. Merga and Chris Redl July 26, 2023 Domestic policies can help support growth in coming years, but long-term prospects also depend on the global community’s ability to prevent destructive global warming outcomes Tuvalu’s population of 11,000 is spread across nine Pacific islands that rise less than five meters above sea level, underscoring its extraordinary challenges from climate change. Tuvalu experienced remarkably limited health consequences from the pandemic due to prompt containment and widespread vaccination. But its economic fallout has been significant—economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels, much-needed climate adaptation projects have been delayed, fiscal pressures have risen, and outbound migration clouds Tuvalu’s growth potential. This economic setback makes addressing the various risks the country faces—from climate change to fiscal sustainability—more difficult. After our visit to Tuvalu earlier this year, as part of our regular review of the economy and consultation with the authorities, we noted in our report that a comprehensive set of policies can help reduce uncertainty, fostering private-sector activity and growth in an economy where the public sector currently plays the predominant role. Raising more revenues and making government spending as efficient as possible can promote fiscal sustainability. At the same time, fiscal reforms, for example to strengthen oversight of spending plans, can facilitate access to climate finance from donors. This financing remains critical given climate adaptation needs that are enormous relative to the size of the economy. This should be complemented by reforms to strengthen the domestic banking industry’s connectivity to the global payments system, deepening trade integration, and enhancing human capital through initiatives such as designing scholarships for overseas study that in turn build up the skills Tuvalu needs. A more diversified economy that succeeds in building resilience should also help incentivize Tuvaluans to deploy their skills in the country, thus reducing migration pressures. Global Climate Action But while domestic policies can go a long way in fostering growth in coming years, Tuvalu’s long-term prospects also depend on the world’s collective ability to prevent destructive global warming scenarios. This is because under a high global emissions scenario and with its existing infrastructure, the country may become uninhabitable by the end of this century as a result of rising sea levels. Such scenarios pose an existential threat to Tuvalu, just as they do to hundreds of millions around the world also living close to sea level. Ultimately, Tuvalu’s climate change plight underscores the responsibility of the global community to urgently step-up efforts to reduce global emissions.

Ending gender-based violence is a priority for the World Bank In 1993, the Declaration of the Elimination of Violence Against Women recognized that violence against women violates women’s rights and fundamental freedoms, and called on states to work towards its eradication. However, thirty years on, women continue to face the risk of violence at home, on the street, on transport, in schools and in the workplace. One in three women worldwide are estimated to have suffered intimate partner violence and/or sexual violence from a non-partner in their lifetime. But gender-based violence also includes the nearly 12 million girls who are married each year before reaching the age of 18, and at least 200 million girls and women who have undergone female genital mutilation. The negative emotional, societal, and economic impacts are immense – entire economies and societies are dwarfed in consequence. Violence affects survivors’ and their children’s well-being, human capital formation through negative life experiences, and productivity. Fear of sexual harassment impacts the mobility of women and girls and their ability to have a healthy and productive life. Labor market impacts of perceived threats of safety and reduced productivity at work – equivalent to almost 10 days of lost work per employee on average each year, according to an IFC study in Fiji – add up to macroeconomic proportions. The World Bank has increasingly engaged to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. Our project work on the ground in countries to address gender-based violence have increased tenfold – extending to every region and sector.  These operations are often multi-sectoral, anchored by strong partnerships with local, regional, and international governmental and non-governmental organizations. For example: 1.	In Bangladesh, a health project financed by the Bank which focuses on the displaced Rohingya population and their host communities, ensures that women and girls have access to immediate response services through safe spaces. The same program also works to shift community attitudes and behaviors accepting of gender-based violence by adapting the SASA! program – a promising approach to transform unequal gender norms related to violence against women and girls. 2.	In Haiti, another project, designed with women-led local civil society organizations, supports the quality and reach of essential services for survivors and women at risk of violence, while also promoting social and economic empowerment of women and girls through community-based activities. 3.	In São Tomé and Príncipe, an education sector project fostering safe schools supports the establishment of girls’ and boys’ clubs that aim to empower girls, increase their socio-emotional skills, and promote positive masculinity. 4.	In India, transport projects support the government to map and assess perception of safety in public spaces, and have developed policy guidelines for people-centered design of transport networks – putting women’s safety at the center of these discussions. 5.	In Uzbekistan, a policy financing operation supported the establishment of referral pathways for survivors of gender-based violence as part of reforms to create more inclusive labor markets and incentivize female labor force participation. Social inclusion and sustainability operations ensuring inclusion and empowerment for all people are galvanizing collective action to scale up social transformation and prevent gender-based violence at the community level. 1.	In Nigeria, a project focusing on better economic opportunities for women through building social capital and livelihood support has supported nearly 20,000 women’s groups. The project elected to use the Social Norms Exploratory Tool – a diagnostic tool – to identify the relevant social norms that drive gender inequality, and developed strategies to shift these norms. With the $500 million scale-up financing, the government of Nigeria further invests in improving women’s livelihood opportunities and addressing gender inequality to build resilient communities. Our newly released report, Gender-Based Violence Prevention and Response in World Bank Operations: Taking Stock After a Decade of Engagement, distills lessons drawn from the last 10 years of work and goes into depth on some of the most promising operational examples across regions. Over the past decade, the World Bank has brought the gender-based violence prevention and response agenda to the forefront of our policy discussions with key actors, such as ministries of finance, education, health, transport, and social affairs – drawing on global knowledge as well as insights from wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders such as local women’s groups. We’ll discuss these initiatives in more detail soon.

Realizing a Brighter Future for a Young, Energized, and Connected Africa “We need the means for our dreams to come true.” –Hafsat Abdullahi, Nigerian poet Dar es Salaam, Tanzania recently bustled with immense energy and optimism. The ambitions and aspirations of young people were matched with commitments by African leaders to take action and invest in people toward a brighter future. The Africa Human Capital Heads of State Summit brought together 18 Heads of State, Heads of Governments, and Ministers—representing 43 countries. They were joined by eminent thought leaders, development partners, and inspiring young artists. Gathered in front of an audience of more than 1,300 people, they responded to a resounding need to supercharge Africa’s economic growth by committing to making more and better investments in their young people. Today, Africa is the only continent where 70% of its people are under the age of 30. By 2035, over 400 million young people will enter working age. “There is strong awareness that we have a challenge,” Victoria Kwakwa, World Bank Regional Vice President for Eastern and Southern Africa said in an interview at the summit. “We have to really rise up and accelerate progress to get human capital built on the continent.” The Dar es Salaam Human Capital Declaration of 2023 (pdf), endorsed by leaders representing 43 countries at the summit’s closing, commits governments to prioritizing ambitious investments in people with specific targets in health, education, and job creation. Supported by increased resources from countries and development partners, targets include reducing learning poverty by at least a quarter and improving literacy rates to reach 75% by 2030. Despite encouraging examples of progress made across the continent, Africa faces human capital constraints. Nearly 100 million children remain out of school and are not prepared to learn, lacking sufficient nutrition and stimulation. And too many students that are attending school are not learning. Learning poverty—the inability of 10-year-olds to read and understand a simple text—is nearly 90%. The continent’s human capital index score is .40, which means young people are forgoing 60% of their productivity potential. “There is going to be an increase in the population of young people and if their energy and capabilities can be harnessed then it opens up this huge opportunity for the continent,” said Mamta Murthi, World Bank Vice President for Human Development, in an interview at the summit. “There needs to be more investment in young people. They need to be well educated and there needs to be the kind of investment that creates jobs so that these young people with skills can be employed. More than resources, this is going to require political commitment.” During the summit, participants recognized the challenges in prioritizing human capital amid fiscal constraints, fragility, and other challenges, but agreed on the importance of education and health— cornerstones of human capital. “The issues should be looked at holistically because they are all interlinked,” said Kwakwa. Discussion at the summit focused on improving the quality of instruction with a focus on reading and basic numeracy, as well as teacher training and more emphasis on secondary school completion, especially for female students. Strengthening the connection between education systems and labor markets was noted. Investments to support access to quality healthcare, nutrition, and stimulation are also key so that children are prepared to learn. Rwanda’s community-driven model of educating low-income parents on caregiving, nutrition, hygiene, and stimulation was cited as one example of an effective and low-cost initiative supporting early childhood education. Participants recognized that realizing the potential of Africa and achieving the goals of the Dar Declaration will require everyone to do their part: governments taking leadership and making bold policy choices, the private sector working to provide skills and create jobs, civil society to drive momentum for change and ensuring accountability, and donors and partners helping mobilize resources and providing technical support.

In the Face of Coronavirus, African Countries Apply Lessons from Ebola Response WASHINGTON, April 3, 2020 – COVID-19 (coronavirus) has arrived in Sub-Saharan Africa, and governments have stepped up measures to prevent the spread of this pandemic. Over the past weeks, travelers have been screened with thermal cameras and health agents have been deployed to increase surveillance, and countries have acted swiftly to cut down flights, close schools and borders, and limit public gatherings. For many African countries that learned difficult lessons from the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, including the Democratic Republic of Congo which now sees an end in sight in the fight against Ebola, these are familiar scenes. Swift detection, early testing and rapid response require cross-border collaboration and strong solidarity among neighboring countries and with the international community to combat the spread of infectious diseases. The response to the 2014 Ebola crisis taught African countries what it takes to invest in more resilient health systems and more effective surveillance mechanisms to cope with epidemics. A strong response to COVID-19 will require building on these lessons together. Health experts in Nigeria and Senegal shared their views on what is being done to curb the spread of the pandemic on the continent and to prepare for its impacts: Surveillance and screening key to contain the spread In the aftermath of the West Africa Ebola crisis, the World Bank leveraged more than $600 million to launch the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement (REDISSE) Project to strengthen health systems and support effective disease surveillance 16 West and Central African countries. The Institut Pasteur in Dakar was one of the first laboratories on the continent to be accredited by the World Health Organization for testing of COVID-19. The team of the institute started preparing in January as the laboratory is used to handle similar disease outbreaks. “WHO assigned us this regional role. Since then, we trained 25 laboratories and another institute in South Africa trained about 18 more. We have now more than 30 laboratories in the region with the capacity to test for coronavirus,” said Dr. Amadou Alpha Sall, Director General at the Institut Pasteur. Under the REDISSE program, the Institut Pasteur was able to strengthen its surveillance system by procuring more laboratory equipment for testing including bio security equipment to increase its capacity to run more tests and guarantee safety and quality protocols for running these tests. “We were able to enhance surveillance systems for all kind of diseases across Senegal. The equipment provided will allow us to rapidly detect and improve our capacity to mobilize resources and respond to disease outbreaks like coronavirus,” added Dr. Alpha Sall. Working as one to prepare and respond For Dr. John Oladejo, Director for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), coordination among all partners in countries and across boundaries is essential to prevent the spread of an outbreak. Since 2017, the World Bank has provided support to the NCDC to strengthen the country’s capacity to prevent, rapidly detect, prepare and respond to disease outbreaks. “When the COVID-19 virus was announced, we started a technical working group for preparedness. We had all partners involved and started preparing, looking at infrastructure, schedules of drugs, points of entries where suspected cases would most likely be coming from. Immediately, we had the first suspected case in February, we quickly started the Emergency Operations Centre. We finalized our Incident Action Plan and followed it strictly to ensure we didn’t leave any stone unturned. The World Bank, UNICEF, WHO and the NCDC all worked as one to pull this off,” said Dr. Oladejo. Together with other regional partners, the World Bank is helping countries take the necessary steps in response to this global threat. Last week, a $14 billion package of fast-track financing was approved to assist companies and countries in their efforts to prevent, detect and respond to the rapid spread of COVID-19. The package will strengthen national systems for public health preparedness, including for disease containment, diagnosis, and treatment, and support the private sector.

85 Million Reasons to Prioritize Persons With Disabilities During Disasters in Latin America and the Caribbean Madelyne Castillo is studying psychology at the public University of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. Because she uses a wheelchair and there are no elevators or ramps available, she has to ask several of her classmates to carry her up three flights of stairs to get to her classes. Her case is not unique. In Latin America and the Caribbean there are many systems that aren’t designed for persons with disabilities. If we add disasters to the mix, the situation becomes even more challenging. Disasters caused by natural hazards are happening more frequently and becoming more severe every year. Early warning systems and preparedness plans can help - but what happens if they are just based on sound or images, and not accessible to people with hearing or vision disabilities? And during the disaster, what happens if the shelters are not accessible by wheelchair and don’t allow service animals? After a disaster, are persons with disabilities being consulted to make sure newly reconstructed infrastructure is accessible? With approximately 85 million people living with a disability in Latin America and the Caribbean, these are the kind of questions that need to be asked and answered. Disability in Latin America and the Caribbean 15% of the world’s population experiences some form of disability. According to the United Nations, the term persons with disabilities is inclusive of long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which, in interaction with various attitudinal and environmental barriers, hinders full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. “This framing is important,'' says Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo, Global Disability Adviser at the World Bank Group. “This definition focuses on the interaction of the individual with their environment, and we can change the environment to be more accessible and more inclusive.” In Latin America and the Caribbean, car crashes are a large cause of disability, as well as diabetes and other chronic diseases, labor-related injuries, and violence such as gun violence and gender-based violence. Women with disabilities are four times more vulnerable to gender-based violence, and gender-based violence can itself result in a range of disabilities. Persons with disabilities are more likely to experience less education, poorer health outcomes, lower levels of employment, and higher poverty rates than persons without disabilities. “There is political will in the Dominican Republic to have more persons with disabilities employed,” says Gisela Eusebio, President of the non-profit Fundacion Gissell Eusebio Life Transformer (inlcude link), “but the barriers to classes and education make it very hard for us to meet the demands of the market and requirements of a job. As persons with disabilities, we have a lot of difficulties with infrastructure we can’t access.  For example, there are only about 5 buses that have ramps for wheelchairs in Santo Domingo. For us to access any of the other buses, we have to be carried onto the bus by two or three bystanders. A person with a disability has to have internal strength because having to ask for help like that affects a person's dignity. I want people to understand that they are worth it, and they can do it.” “There have been strong commitments by governments in the region. Governments are taking this action seriously, and disabled people's groups are well organized and engaged with their governments, for example in Brazil, Argentina, and Ecuador. So there is a strong leadership from the region around disability inclusion,” says Charlotte McClain-Nhlapo.

Countries Catalyze New Preparedness Plans to More Effectively Respond to Future Food and Nutrition Security Crises In 2022, conflict, economic shocks, natural disasters, soaring fertilizer and food prices combined to create a global food and nutrition security crisis of unprecedented proportions, with the poorest bearing the greatest costs. In 2023, all signs point to even further deteriorations in both acute and chronic levels. According to the Global Report on Food Crises 2022 Mid-Year Update, the number of people in crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) or equivalent – that is the number of people requiring urgent humanitarian assistance – is forecast to reach up to 205 million in 45 countries/territories included in the report. Urgent action is necessary to safeguard lives and livelihoods and prevent the reversal of hard-earned development gains. When such crises occur, time is of the essence. The longer it takes to mobilize a response, the more severe a crisis becomes. Vulnerabilities heighten and become protracted, eroding resilience to weather future shocks. Crisis preparedness – the knowledge and capacities to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from the impacts of major shocks – is therefore critical. To promote greater preparedness to major food and nutrition security crises, the World Bank as part of the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS) – in close collaboration with the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP), and the UN Famine Prevention and Response Coordinator – is supporting countries as they develop and operationalize Food Security Crisis Preparedness Plans (FSCPPs). The FSCPP is a national operational plan that defines what constitutes a major food and nutrition security crisis for a country. The plan explains how crisis risks are actively monitored and identified and details step-by-step protocols, roles, and timelines for mobilizing additional funding and scaled up early action. What is the Food Security Crisis Preparedness Plan? Each national FSCPP brings together fragmented crisis preparedness elements into a cohesive operational framework to support the systematic recognition of an emerging crisis. Once a crisis is recognized, FSCPPs will prompt timely, joined-up early action across government, humanitarian, and development partners to prevent and mitigate the impacts of the crisis. Actions build on the strengths of the 60+ multilateral and bilateral humanitarian and development partners of GAFS and the Global Food and Nutrition Security Dashboard, as well as the GNAFC. The FSCPP is guided by seven key principles. 1. Government owned and led Where possible, the government will be at the center of developing and managing the FSCPP across all relevant national and local institutions and agencies. In contexts in which a government may have limited operational capacity, these functions will be supported by the international community – with responsibilities shared across humanitarian and development partners – until the government’s capacity is built. 2. Focused on major food and nutrition security crises In any given year, a country may face numerous shocks affecting food and nutrition security, some of which may have localized and limited impacts while others can lead to widespread and severe consequences across the country. The FSCPP is focused on these latter shocks which extend beyond and exacerbate existing chronic issues and threaten to lead to major food and nutrition security crises. In the event of such major shocks, it is critical for responses to be mobilized across all support channels, including government, humanitarian, and development partners. 3. Evidence-based The FSCPP will be anchored by rigorous, well vetted, and timely food and nutrition security information and data from a wide variety of sources to provide a comprehensive view of emerging and major risks. 4. Holistic If a major crisis is identified, activities should be scaled up quickly and coordinated across the fullness of government, humanitarian, and development partners, utilizing the comparative advantages of all partners to save lives, protect livelihoods, and build resilience to future shocks. 5. Do no harm The FCSPP should carefully take into consideration country and local contexts and account for how responses may interact with and affect existing economic, political, and social dynamics, especially for the most vulnerable.

SCO Celebrates Formal Ownership Of Landmark HBC Building As Historic Act Of Reconciliation Takes Next Step FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: March 30, 2023 ANISHINAABE AND DAKOTA TERRITORY, MB — The landmark HBC building in downtown Winnipeg has officially been transferred to the Southern Chiefs’ Organization (SCO). On behalf of 34 Anishnaabe and Dakota Nations in southern Manitoba, SCO is very pleased to share new details and images related to the transformation of this iconic structure, which is situated at the corner of Portage Avenue and Memorial Boulevard in Treaty One territory. “The formal transfer of the HBC building to SCO on the Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn project is a monumental moment for southern First Nations,” stated SCO Grand Chief Jerry Daniels. “While there is much work ahead to transform the space, this building will become home to hundreds of families with childcare and a health and healing centre on site, as well as a spectacular museum, restaurants, a place of commemoration to honour Survivors, and so much more. This journey is an essential step towards reconciliation.” In spring 2022, SCO welcomed HBC Governor Richard Baker and Prime Minister Trudeau to our territory and together with southern Chiefs, the Premier, the Mayor, and community leaders, announced plans to transform the HBC heritage building into a space that offers opportunities for economic and social reconciliation. SCO and HBC have worked closely since the announcement to ensure the transfer. Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn, or ‘it is visible,’ will revitalize the HBC building while preserving its important heritage and helping to revive Winnipeg’s downtown. “HBC is incredibly proud to advance our journey with SCO and reach this milestone, where we officially transfer ownership of the building,” said Richard Baker, Governor, HBC. “We remain committed partners to SCO as they work to realize their incredible vision for this new space, and hope that others are inspired to take meaningful action toward reconciliation in their own way.” SCO has issued a Request for Qualifications to begin the redevelopment using a competitive process ensuring the best value for the project, which is the largest redevelopment of an historic building in Manitoba, and one of the largest projects of its kind in Canada.SCO is aiming to reopen the building in November 2026, the same month the building turns 100 years old. Almost 100 years ago, the construction of the HBC building at 450 Portage Avenue took 300 men, 120 teams of horses, 20 trucks, and two steam shovels to excavate 150,000 tons of earth to lay the foundation of the store. At the time of its opening in 1926, the structure, designed by Canadian architect Ernest Isbell Barrott, was the largest reinforced concrete building in Canada, with more than six hectares of floor space. The Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn project plans include more than 300 affordable housing units for families and post-secondary students, and culturally safe assisted living units for First Nation Elders. Families living in the building and employees who work there will also have access to much needed high-quality, licensed childcare and a rooftop garden. The improvement of First Nation peoples’ health and wellness is also incorporated, with a health and healing centre that embraces both western and traditional practices. The historic building will also become the future Governance House for the Chiefs of the southern First Nations, the voice for 34 Anishinaabe and Dakota Nations in the Territory now known as Manitoba. The main floor will be dedicated public space where all Manitobans, Canadians, and tourists from around the globe can come together to experience a world class museum that shares the history of the Anishinaabe and Dakota peoples, in part through artifacts reclaimed from Vatican vaults. There will also be much needed space for ceremony and commemoration, through a memorial to honour the Survivors of residential and day schools and the children who did not return home.

March 2023 global poverty update from the World Bank: the challenge of estimating poverty in the pandemic Global poverty estimates were updated today on the Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP). This update includes new regional poverty aggregates in 2020 and 2021 for Latin America and the Caribbean, and in 2020 for Europe and Central Asia, and the group of advanced countries. These are the regions for which we now have sufficient survey data available during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 113 new country-years have been added, bringing the total number of surveys to more than 2,100. This update also incorporates the usual changes to the input data, including revisions to existing welfare distributions, the inclusion of new welfare distributions, and revisions to price, national accounts, and population data used for global poverty monitoring (more details here). Overall, these changes have resulted in minor revisions in global and regional poverty estimates. Table 1 summarizes the revisions to the regional and global poverty estimates between the September 2022 data vintage and the March 2023 data vintage for the 2019 reference year at all three poverty lines. The global poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 is revised slightly up by 0.1 percentage points to 8.5 percent, resulting in a revision in the number of poor people from 648 to 659 million. This revision represents 11 million more people living in extreme poverty, largely driven by South Asia (5 million) and the Middle East and North Africa (4 million). Similar limited changes in poverty estimates are observed at the higher lines of $3.65 and $6.85, which are typically used for measuring poverty in lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries, respectively. At $3.65, the global poverty headcount ratio increases by 0.1 percentage points to 23.6 percent, representing 28 million more people living in poverty. At $6.85, the global poverty rate increases by 0.2 percentage points to 46.9 percent, representing 44 million people living in poverty. The upward revisions in poverty estimates at the higher lines are largely driven by South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. This March 2023 global poverty update from the World Bank revises the previously published global and regional estimates from 1981 to 2019. Regional poverty estimates are now reported up to 2021, depending on sufficient data coverage over the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty data are reported for Europe and Central Asia until 2020, and Latin America and the Caribbean until 2021. For all other developing regions, poverty data are reported for pre-pandemic years (see Figure 1). More details are available here on how we have determined those regions for which to report post-2019 estimates. The data published in this PIP update, while incorporating more recent input data, do not change the overall perceptions about global poverty trends and the regional distribution of poverty. It is still the case that global poverty has been falling since the 1990s, and at a slower rate since 2014 (World Bank 2022). Extreme poverty has been falling in all regions, except the Middle East and North Africa due to conflict and fragility (World Bank 2020). Roughly 60% of the world’s extreme poor in 2019 lived in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, while 81% of the global poor at the poverty line of $3.65 lived in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia.

How Safer and More Resilient Schools Withstood the Earthquakes in Türkiye It has been about four months since Türkiye was hit by two very large earthquakes of magnitude 7.8 and 7.5 on February 6, 2023, followed by thousands of aftershocks and another strong earthquake of magnitude 6.7 on February 20, 2023. The earthquakes inflicted the heaviest damages in 11 provinces in southern Türkiye, home to 14 million Turkish citizens, representing 16% of the country’s population, and 1.8 million Syrian refugees. The World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)’s rapid damage assessment report using the Global Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Estimation (GRADE) methodology estimated $34.2 billion in initial direct physical damages, with the Turkish government and partners estimating recovery and reconstruction costs to exceed $81 billion. Around 5% of the 20,000 education buildings in the earthquake-affected areas collapsed, or were either severely or moderately damaged. As recovery and reconstruction efforts continue apace, an inspiring story is emerging of how Türkiye’s partnership with the World Bank, GFDRR and the European Union (EU) played its part in ensuring that recently constructed schools withstood what has now become the deadliest earthquake disaster in the country’s modern history. Since 2017, with support from the World Bank and GFDRR, as well as the European Union through its Facility for Refugees in Turkey (FRiT), Türkiye’s Ministry of National Education has built 57 schools, representing over 1,400 classrooms, based on Türkiye’s latest seismic code which was updated in 2018 in accordance with international earthquake engineering standards. These efforts have been undertaken under the auspices of the Education Infrastructure for Resilience Project. Every single one of the 24 schools located in areas affected by the February 2023 earthquakes and aftershocks survived. Fortunately, the earthquakes struck outside of school hours, which also contributed to saving the lives of students and educators. “Most of the parents came to look at the school. They saw that there is not even the smallest crack or plaster crack in our school. We continue our educational activities seamlessly where we left before the earthquake,” said Murat Çiçekdal, School Manager for the Martyr Ercan Sanca Primary School.  Among the 24 schools in affected areas, four schools, which are located in Kahramanmaraş province, have been used by the Turkish government to provide temporary shelters. These same schools have also been used by the government for the provision of vital services for affected populations. Across Türkiye, it is estimated that over 40,000 people now have access to safer and resilient schools as a result of the Ministry of National Education’s initiative on safer schools, supported under the Education Infrastructure for Resilience Project. Roughly half of the beneficiaries are estimated to be female. In addition to seismic safety, each of the 57 schools built through this project also complied with Turkish codes and regulations on land use planning, energy efficiency, fire protection, workplace safety, and access for people with disabilities. The end result has been a safer and better learning environment for students and trainees. Determined to ensure the resilience of its education infrastructure in one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, Türkiye has been a leader in the safer schools agenda. Since 2015, Türkiye has partnered with the World Bank and GFDRR, including through the Global Program for Safer Schools (GPSS),  on ensuring that schools across the country are safer and more resilient to disaster. In the context of the Education Infrastructure for Resilience Project and the Disaster Risk Management in Schools Project, GFDRR, in particular, has connected the Turkish government with international experiences on safer schools, helped established a program on reducing seismic risk, and supported the expansion of disaster-resilient education infrastructure. Looking ahead, the World Bank and GFDRR will remain steadfast in supporting Türkiye as it strives to rebuild and recover in the aftermath of the devastation, while also continuing to lay the groundwork for a more resilient future.

Empowering Youth for Sustainable Development The Role of Media and Information Literacy in Promoting Green Skills 15 August 2023 International Youth Day is a global occasion that celebrates the contributions of young individuals and recognizes their potential to create a more sustainable and inclusive world. As the challenges posed by environmental degradation become more pressing, the need for equipping young people with the tools to promote sustainable development has never been greater. One of the key ways to achieve this is through media and information literacy (MIL), which empowers youth with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to navigate the complex landscape of environmental issues and develop green skills that contribute to a more sustainable future. As we celebrate International Youth Day, it is imperative to recognize the role of media and information literacy in nurturing green skills among young individuals. By equipping youth with the ability to critically engage with media content and make informed decisions, we empower them to become leaders in sustainable development. Media and information literacy not only enhances their understanding of environmental issues but also enables them to drive change, promote eco-friendly practices, and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come. Green skills encompass a range of competencies and knowledge that are geared towards environmental sustainability. These skills enable individuals to contribute to eco-friendly practices, develop innovative solutions for environmental challenges, and participate actively in the transition to a greener and more sustainable economy. Green skills cover areas such as renewable energy, waste reduction, conservation, sustainable agriculture, and more. By acquiring these skills, young people can play a pivotal role in driving sustainable development and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Media and information literacy (MIL) serves as a catalyst for the development and promotion of green skills among the youth. In a world inundated with information, misinformation, and rapidly evolving technologies, MIL equips young individuals with the ability to critically assess and analyse media content, discern credible sources, and make informed decisions. MIL empowers them to sift through the noise, identify reliable information, and gain a deep understanding of environmental issues and solutions. MIL enables young people to access a wealth of information on environmental conservation, climate change, and sustainable practices. Through various media channels, including websites, documentaries, podcasts, and social media, they can learn about successful green initiatives, cutting-edge technologies, and inspiring stories of environmental stewardship. By developing media and information literacy skills, youth can amplify their impact by sharing accurate and impactful information with their peers, communities, and the wider world. Media and information literacy encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for tackling complex environmental challenges. Young people who possess MIL skills can analyse data, evaluate policy proposals, and think creatively about sustainable solutions. By critically engaging with information, they can contribute to informed discussions and decision-making processes related to environmental issues, advocating for policies that prioritize sustainability. MIL empowers young individuals to become agents of change by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Armed with accurate information and critical thinking abilities, youth can identify gaps in the market for sustainable products and services. They can develop and launch green start-ups, creating solutions that address environmental challenges while generating economic opportunities. MIL enables them to navigate the business landscape, connect with mentors, and access resources that support their entrepreneurial endeavours. UNESCO is the leading organization promoting media and information literacy. Media and information literacy empowers people to think critically about information and use of digital tools. It helps people make informed choices about how they participate in peace building, equality, freedom of expression, dialogue, access to information, and sustainable development. UNESCO supports and champions media and information literacy initiatives across the globe.
