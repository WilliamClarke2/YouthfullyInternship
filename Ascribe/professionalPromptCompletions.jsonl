This comprehensive document is the result of extensive input from nearly 1,000 young individuals from diverse backgrounds across Canada. It highlights the valuable contributions of youth in our country and recognizes their potential to shape a brighter future for all.\n\nThe youth in Canada are actively engaged, resourceful, and resilient. They are not only the leaders of tomorrow but also of today. They possess a deep understanding of the most pressing issues our nation faces and have the innovative ideas and solutions to tackle them. This report focuses on their primary concerns, including truth finding and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, environmental sustainability and climate action, health and well-being, leadership and impact, employment, and innovation, skills, and learning. It showcases their perspectives on these matters and presents their vision for creating a more inclusive and prosperous Canada.\n\nThe past year has presented significant challenges for everyone due to the global pandemic, and Canadian youth have been disproportionately affected. They have made tremendous sacrifices to protect their families and must be at the forefront of our recovery efforts as we rebuild and emerge stronger from this crisis. The Government of Canada has made strategic investments to support vulnerable youth, including those facing employment barriers. Additionally, measures have been implemented to facilitate access to education, alleviate student debt, and provide training and employment opportunities. By investing in our youth, we are investing in Canada's long-term success and prosperity.\n\nI extend my sincerest gratitude to the hundreds of young individuals who contributed to the creation of this report, as well as all those involved in its preparation. As the former Minister of Youth, I am committed to advancing this vital work through the Youth Council and the continued implementation of Canada's first-ever youth policy. Our government will continue to listen to the voices of young people, collaborate with them, and take action to empower them to drive change in their communities and turn their dreams into reality.\n\nThe State of Youth Report is truly unique in its approach, serving as a reminder that youth across the country are brimming with fresh and innovative ideas to address our most complex challenges. The recommendations contained within this report are the culmination of engagement sessions with approximately 1,000 young individuals, including First Nations, M\u00e9tis, Inuit, Black, racialized, and LGBTQ2 youth. Many of these young individuals face barriers to meaningful participation in society. In my role as Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, I have had the privilege of meeting many of these inspiring youth, witnessing their unwavering commitment to building a better Canada. Like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I firmly believe in the power of youth, which is why it was crucial to develop this report \"for youth, with youth, and by youth.\"\n\nWhile this may be the first report of its kind, it aligns with our government's longstanding commitment to creating a brighter future for Canadian youth. It is important to recognize that youth in Canada represent a diverse cross-section of society, each with unique circumstances based on their location, life stage, and background. These intersecting identities contribute to the rich diversity of our nation but can also pose challenges to youth reaching their full potential. With this in mind, I invite you to read this report, reflect on the recommendations, and gain further insight into the state of young people in our country, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. Only by listening to and hearing from our young leaders can we forge a better future for all Canadians."}]}

In 2008, Reid seized an exciting opportunity at an aerospace company and landed a job as a shuttle flight controller at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This experience redirected his career path towards the aerospace industry.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, Mission Control has grown from humble beginnings to producing software that is destined for the moon. The company is proud to announce a significant milestone next year as it partners with the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to assist a small rover in navigating the moon's terrain. Mission Control's cutting-edge artificial intelligence software enables the operation of robots remotely via the internet. On Earth, the software will transmit near real-time data to scientists at four Canadian universities who will collaborate with the Dubai Space Centre team to determine the rover's path.\n\nThis collaboration with the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre presents an opportunity for Mission Control to showcase its technology in space for the first time. Ewan Reid expresses his pride in the team's achievements and their honor in representing Canada on the Emirates' lunar mission. This endeavor is the first instance of Canadian software, computer, and artificial intelligence being deployed on the moon.\n\nMission Control is fully prepared for this inaugural venture into space, which could potentially unlock numerous opportunities for the company. They have been practicing their software by driving rovers in a simulated lunar environment at their 4,000-square-foot office, aptly named the \"Moonyard.\" This testing facility replicates the moon's surface with sand, rocks, craters, black walls, and simulated sunlight. This dedicated space allows Mission Control and its partners to rehearse before embarking on actual lunar explorations.\n\nIn 2021, Mission Control proudly showcased their world-class facility and software at Expo 2020 Dubai and the International Astronautical Congress, reaching a global audience. Ewan Reid emphasizes the importance of collaborating with international space organizations in the industry, as very few space missions can be accomplished by a single country. Participating in events like Expo is crucial for establishing relationships, forging partnerships, and executing significant space missions.\n\nThe Canadian Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) has played a vital role in supporting Mission Control's growth by facilitating their exploration of markets in Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates. During a trade mission to the UAE in 2019, Ewan Reid met with officials from the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre for the first time. Additionally, through the TCS, Reid was introduced to iSpace, a lunar exploration company in Japan that is integral to the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre mission. iSpace's lander will transport the space centre's rover and Mission Control's software to the moon. The TCS has effectively assisted Mission Control in expanding its presence in international markets, nurturing new partnerships, and achieving new heights."}]}

Pearson Building, a symbol of Canada's international involvement. Located at 125 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, it serves as the headquarters of Global Affairs Canada, accommodating approximately 3,300 employees. Today, we take a moment to celebrate the rich history and enduring legacy of this building. \n\nThe Lester B. Pearson Building is situated on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg people and holds a prominent position on Sussex Drive, along the ceremonial route from Parliament Hill to Rideau Hall, the Governor General's residence. With its four office towers, this building represents a significant chapter in Canada's architectural and governmental heritage.\n\nDesigned by the esteemed firm Webb Zerafa Menk\u00e8s Housden and constructed between 1970 and 1973, the building was named in honor of Lester B. Pearson, an esteemed Prime Minister, diplomat, and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Pearson's visionary leadership resulted in historic contributions to peacekeeping, including the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force. In 1973, a government spokesman aptly stated to The New York Times, \"it is appropriate that Canada's first physical expression of its relations with the rest of the world be named for Mr. Pearson.\"\n\nThe architectural brilliance of the building showcases the late modern movement, incorporating elements of brutalism. The design aimed to create a sense of repose, quiet dignity, precision, and restraint. Strong horizontal lines, an organic form, and the use of dark materials brought this vision to life. As a result, the building has become a landmark, leaving a lasting impression on all who visit the bustling neighborhood.\n\nOver the past five decades, the Lester B. Pearson Building has served as the epicenter of the department now known as Global Affairs Canada. Its halls have witnessed historic events, state visits, and significant diplomatic engagements. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the building on August 1, 1973, expressing her joy that the ceremony coincided with her first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, underscoring the moment's significance for Commonwealth nations.\n\nThe dedicated foreign service officers and diplomatic leaders working at the building have played a pivotal role in promoting and safeguarding Canada's interests on the global stage. Throughout the past 50 years, the Lester B. Pearson Building has housed public servants who have championed causes such as human rights, gender equality, and peacekeeping worldwide. The department has advanced Canada's foreign policy objectives, showcased the nation's values, and provided a strong voice in international forums.\n\nRecognizing the need to evolve with the changing world, a large-scale rehabilitation project was announced in 2017. The renovation includes upgraded plumbing and electrical systems to enhance the building's environmental performance and aims for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification. The interior spaces are being transformed to align with the new government of Canada standard for offices, emphasizing collaboration and flexibility introduced in 2022.\n\nAs we celebrate 50 years of the Lester B. Pearson Building, we pay tribute to its remarkable heritage. This iconic structure remains a steadfast embodiment of Canada's commitment to diplomacy, collaboration, and global engagement. Let us draw inspiration from the values and principles it represents as we forge ahead to foster peace, prosperity, and cooperation on the world stage."}]}

But what exactly does a feminist approach to international assistance entail? Contrary to the misconception that it solely prioritizes women and leaves men and boys behind, the policy is feminist because it tackles the underlying causes of poverty through an intersectional, human rights-based, and feminist lens. This means it takes into account various forms of discrimination that people face, enabling us to identify those in extreme poverty, vulnerability, and marginalization.\n\nThe goal of the policy is to create a more equitable society by addressing key barriers to equality. It recognizes that poverty cannot be eliminated without considering the diverse needs of different groups. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by entrenched gender inequalities, both in Canada and globally, particularly those marginalized within society. To truly build a peaceful and prosperous world, we must confront these inequalities so that everyone can fully enjoy their human rights, regardless of their gender identity, expression, sex characteristics, or other identity factors.\n\nInterventions that advance gender equality have been proven to have the most significant impact on reducing poverty worldwide. A United Nations study revealed that closing the gender gap in farming and agrifood systems could boost global gross domestic product by almost a trillion US dollars and reduce the number of food-insecure individuals by 45 million. This statistic highlights the current inequalities that persist.\n\nCanada supports initiatives like SeedChange, which focuses on empowering women and ensuring their representation in leadership positions within collective enterprises such as farming co-ops. SeedChange has made a significant impact in the Central American dry corridor, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Ethiopia, improving seed, food, and economic security for over 26,000 small-scale farm households. The project has resulted in the growth of more fruits, vegetables, and diverse crops, making nutritious food more accessible to families living in poverty. The data collected over five years demonstrates that the project has led to healthier diets, better livelihoods, improved climate resilience, and increased autonomy in every community. Over 100 women's groups and almost 40 youth-run co-ops have overcome barriers to enter the marketplace.\n\nIn Gaza, female-headed households experience higher poverty rates and pronounced inequality due to traditional gender roles prevailing in society. Through the Canada-funded Salalem Leadership Institute, Sarah, a single mother of two, participated in an eight-week entrepreneurship training program and received support for her agricultural startup. With the help of her mother and brothers, Sarah successfully started her dream business, providing a secure future for her children. Salalem provided her with mentorship to enhance her farming practices and expand her business. Sarah has now completed six consecutive farming seasons, and after a year of running her business successfully, she was able to rent a larger piece of land to diversify and increase her farming production. She also ventured into animal breeding and production by acquiring goats.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the positive impact of Canada's feminist international assistance policy in reducing poverty and empowering individuals and communities around the world."}]}

It is important to consider factors such as size, layout, location, and appearance while also adhering to zoning and environmental regulations.\n\nCommercial buildings come in various shapes, locations, and price ranges, so it is essential to understand your specific needs and budget. If you have worked on a business plan, you likely have an idea of how much you can allocate towards rent or a mortgage, utilities, and taxes. Conducting a cash-flow analysis will help determine if purchasing a property is feasible or if renting is the more viable option. Renting may allow you to retain more working capital for your business, but it is important to consider future rent increases. On the other hand, owning a property provides the advantage of predictable monthly mortgage payments and the opportunity to build equity for your business. It is crucial to carefully evaluate and compare your options before deciding whether to buy or lease your commercial space.\n\nIn the meantime, here are five tips to assist you in finding the ideal location for your business:\n\n1. Tailor your selection to suit the needs of your business. For retailers, ample parking, pedestrian traffic, and attractive decor are important. Being situated near popular stores can attract walk-by customers. However, if you sell high-end clothing, it may be more suitable to avoid discount malls and instead be located near other high-end retailers. For small wholesale or manufacturing operations, while location and decor are less vital, compliance with zoning regulations is necessary. Additionally, consider the availability of qualified employees within a reasonable commute.\n\n2. Assess if the building requires modifications. If you have found a suitable building in a desirable location, it is important to consider the necessary modifications and who will bear the costs. When renting, negotiations with the owner are required, and a contract specifying the work, deadlines, and penalties must be established. When purchasing, engage an accredited inspection company to evaluate the building for defects and the property for environmental contamination. Defects can be bargaining points or potential headaches to avoid. It is also crucial to be aware of zoning or heritage regulations, as even minor changes may require municipal approval.\n\n3. Consider local taxes and infrastructure. Taxes differ between municipalities, and some towns offer preferential rates to attract businesses. Your commercial real estate agent should be able to provide information on taxes as well as the availability of infrastructure and utilities, such as internet access, garbage pickup, roads, electricity, and natural gas."}]}

These parks serve as protected havens that present outstanding examples of the diverse natural landscapes and phenomena found in each of Canada's distinct regions. When establishing new parks, factors such as ecological connectivity and representation within the system plan are also taken into consideration.\n\nSpanning across every province and territory, national parks encompass a wide range of landscapes, including mountains, plains, boreal forests, tundra, lakes, and glaciers. They safeguard the habitats, wildlife, and ecosystem diversity that characterize these natural regions. From the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts to the interior mountains, plains, and great lakes, national parks occupy various locations and vary in size from 14 km2 to almost 45,000 km2. Some well-known parks include Banff, Jasper, Ivavik, and Vuntut.\n\nParks Canada holds the responsibility of protecting and managing these breathtaking natural areas, ensuring their preservation and offering visitors the opportunity to understand, appreciate, and enjoy them without compromising their integrity. The captivating scenery and surroundings of national parks provide an ideal setting for connecting with nature, fostering respect, and making a commitment to its conservation.\n\nEach national park is a sanctuary for the human spirit, narrating the natural origins of these lands and the ongoing processes that shape them, such as mountain formation, lake emergence, forest growth, glacier movements, and grassland evolution. Moreover, they allow visitors to witness natural events like floods, fires, and species migration. These experiences forge connections with nature, people, and the defining events of the regions. Whether kayaking down ancient rivers, observing migratory birds, or exploring vibrant forests regenerated by fire, national parks offer truly unforgettable encounters, enriched by the exceptional experiences provided by Parks Canada.\n\nPreserving ecological integrity is a fundamental objective for Parks Canada, as it strives to maintain or restore the health and wholeness of national park ecosystems. This entails ensuring the biodiversity, structure, and functions of ecosystems remain unimpaired and likely to persist. National parks hold a special place in the hearts of Canadians, serving as a source of pride and an integral part of our national identity, celebrating the remarkable beauty and limitless diversity of our land.\n\nThe National Parks System Plan identifies and aims to safeguard each of Canada's unique natural regions. This strategic framework has guided the expansion of the parks system for many years. For a PDF copy of the National Park System Plan (1997), please contact us at information@pc.gc.ca."}]}

This seemingly impossible task is successfully accomplished by tiny monarch butterflies. Not only do they traverse the Great Lakes, but they also migrate across entire countries. However, the journey for these at-risk species is becoming increasingly challenging each year.\n\nDuring the fall, monarch butterflies escape the cold through migration. They travel from southern Canada all the way down to Mexico to spend the winter. In the spring, a new generation of butterflies embarks on a journey of thousands of kilometers from Mexico. They cross the United States, traversing fields, mountains, and even the Great Lakes, to return to Canada and start the cycle again.\n\nConsider the implications if the butterflies arrived back in Canada only to find asphalt and mowed grass. They would have no sustenance or resting places to recover. Parks Canada is actively working to prevent this scenario and we need your assistance!\n\nFortunately, when many monarchs cross Lake Erie from the United States, they are welcomed by Point Pelee National Park. Point Pelee, the southernmost point of mainland Canada, is the most ecologically diverse national park in the country. Here, the butterflies find an abundance of food and shelter for much-needed rest after their arduous journey. Some butterflies then continue north and east throughout Ontario, potentially finding summer homes in Parks Canada administered areas such as Bruce Peninsula National Park, Rouge National Urban Park, Georgian Bay Islands National Park, and more. These locations serve as stops along their migration.\n\nHowever, as these butterflies venture beyond national parks, they encounter landscape fragmentation. Urban development, roads, industrial agriculture, and other factors have led to the loss and fragmentation of their habitat. The need to travel longer distances in search of suitable habitats exacerbates their already difficult journey.\n\nIn order to support the monarch butterfly and other at-risk species, Parks Canada is actively restoring ecosystems to provide stepping stones of habitat. These stops enable species to move more freely and easily within their natural environment. By planting native trees, grasses, and wildflowers in protected areas, Parks Canada is creating food and habitat where migrating birds and butterflies can rest and refuel before continuing their journey.\n\nTogether with indigenous communities, partners, and volunteers, Parks Canada has restored over 40 hectares (98.8 acres) of meadow, coastal sand dune, and savannah habitat in national parks in Ontario. These habitats are crucial for pollinators. Over the past five years, we have also planted more than 145,000 native shrubs and trees, as well as nearly 18,000 native grasses and wildflowers. Our work to conserve and restore healthy ecosystems that provide important habitat is just one part of a larger puzzle.\n\nYou, too, can contribute to the solution of habitat loss by providing habitat \"stepping stones\". Imagine if, once a monarch butterfly moves on from a national park, it found your yard, garden box, or balcony filled with native plants. There, it could rest and refuel before continuing its journey to another protected area. Even planting a few native plants or wildflowers can significantly ease the butterfly's journey. It doesn't require a large yard to make a difference \u2013 planting a small garden or a few native plants on your balcony is equally important, especially in urban areas. If you don't have the space to plant at home, consider joining a community garden in your neighborhood.\n\nTo help pollinators, we recommend planting a variety of native plants and wildflowers. Milkweed is particularly beneficial for monarchs, as it is the only plant that their caterpillars eat. Consult Pollinator Partnership Canada's ecoregional planting guides or their 'Find Your Roots' native plant finder tool for recommended plants in your area. You can also refer to the Canadian Wildlife Federation's list of Canadian native plant suppliers to support local businesses when purchasing plants and seeds."}]}

Unfortunately, these areas are often overlooked and disregarded. One reason for their neglect is their ambiguous nature, residing neither fully on land nor in water. Dr. Chantal Vis, an expert in aquatic ecosystems at Parks Canada, explains that studying wetlands presents challenges because limited research can be conducted from both land and boats. Additionally, wetlands are undervalued due to their historical reputation as wastelands. Throughout history, wetlands have been drained to make way for agriculture and development, an unfortunate trend that continues today. Southern Ontario has lost a staggering 68 percent of its wetlands, while urban areas in the prairies have witnessed losses of up to 96 percent.\n\nCommonly associated with negative imagery in popular culture, such as snakes and monsters, wetlands actually provide a multitude of valuable services to society. Jim Stafford's song \"Swamp Witch\" perpetuates these misconceptions, but to portray the truth, he could have included a line about the ecosystem services wetlands offer. These services range from carbon storage to flood and pollution control. Rather than fearing the multitude of eyes present in wetlands, they are a testament to the biological richness found within them.\n\nWetlands function as biofilters, allowing water to pass through and settle sediment, while microbes break down pollutants within it. Wetland vegetation, such as cattails and bulrushes, further aid in pollutant removal, absorbing toxic heavy metals and fertilizer residues. This capability has earned wetlands the nickname \"nature's kidneys.\" Moreover, wetlands play a crucial role in flood and erosion control, slowing and absorbing water during periods of heavy rainfall and then gradually releasing stored water during dry spells. Their significance extends beyond their immediate surroundings, as wetlands absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Bogs, specifically, with their peat-filled soil, are particularly effective at this.\n\nBiological diversity thrives within wetlands, making them ecological hotspots. Scientists estimate that around one-third of all North American species at risk rely on wetlands. Globally, wetlands also provide fuel and building materials. Recognizing the value of wetlands, Ontario's Rouge National Urban Park has embarked on extensive restoration efforts in collaboration with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, schools, community groups, and indigenous partners. Since 2015, they have restored over 60 hectares of wetland, stream, and riverbank habitats, often replicating wetlands where they historically existed. Julia Phillips, an ecologist at Rouge, explains that this process involves careful consideration of drainage lines and implementing berms to retain water on the landscape, mimicking the behavior of beavers.\n\nThese wetland restoration efforts have yielded numerous benefits, including the filtration of agricultural runoff and reduced flooding on farmers' fields. Additionally, wetlands contribute to the preservation of a spongy landscape that once existed naturally. The work at Rouge and other national parks emphasizes the role of wetlands as crucial natural engineering systems that foster a healthy environment. Dr. Chantal Vis emphasizes the importance of recognizing wetlands as habitats that have suffered the most losses, stating that despite the immense value they offer, they are not given the appreciation they deserve. Perhaps, someone should compose a song to convey their significance to a wider audience."}]}

However, this despised crustacean may hold the key to addressing the global issue of plastic pollution. Parks Canada has partnered with Dr. Audrey Moores, a chemistry professor at McGill University, to explore the possibility of producing biodegradable plastic from the shells of European green crabs. This collaboration, described as a \"marriage made in heaven\" by Chris McCarthy, Resource Conservation Manager for Parks Canada, highlights the irony of a green pest contributing to the field of \"green chemistry.\"\n\nThe partnership began when Dr. Moores published a paper on utilizing chitin, the material found in the shells of insects and crustaceans, for the production of biodegradable plastic. This paper caught the attention of Gabrielle Beaulieu, Coastal Restoration Project Manager at Kejimkujik National Park and Historic Site in Nova Scotia. Kejimkujik was dealing with an invasion of green crabs, a common issue in Atlantic North America. Ms. Beaulieu and Mr. McCarthy approached Dr. Moores with the idea of turning their problem into a solution, or at the very least, utilizing it as raw material for a solution. Dr. Moores expressed great interest in their initiative, leading to a successful crowdfunding campaign through the Fathom Fund, a project of the Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network (MEOPAR). Parks Canada will contribute $20,000 to the project, enabling the hiring of a full-time researcher based near Kejimkujik.\n\nKejimkujik's struggle with green crabs began in 2007 when conservation staff noticed the alarming decline of eelgrass, a vital marine plant that serves as a nursery for several commercially fished species in Nova Scotia. By 2010, eelgrass coverage in the Port Joli Estuary had decreased to only 2% of its levels in 1987. The disappearance of eelgrass had detrimental effects on marine species and the birds that rely on them for food. Adult green crabs would uproot eelgrass while searching for their prey, which includes clams, mussels, oysters, smaller crabs, and even small fish. To combat this issue, Kejimkujik began trapping and removing green crabs with the help of rowboats and canoes. A citizen science initiative called \"Gone Crabbin'\" was introduced, allowing park visitors to participate in the control program. To date, over 2 million green crabs have been removed from estuary locations within the park, leading to the recovery of nearly 40% of the original eelgrass beds and the overall improvement of estuarine biodiversity. Kejimkujik has also successfully encouraged the use of green crabs as lobster bait and as a source of food.\n\nThe partnership between Parks Canada and Dr. Moores not only benefits coastal communities and ecosystems but also holds potential for improving ocean health. Conventional plastic poses a significant problem for the world's oceans, as it does not break down and can contaminate the food chain. Approximately one-third of the world's plastic ends up in the ocean. While biodegradable plastic made from chitin already exists, it is currently produced on a small scale and can be environmentally harmful. Dr. Moores' approach utilizes green chemistry to produce the plastic cleanly and on a larger scale. Thus, the despised European green crab may one day contribute to the well-being of the ocean. It is indeed rewarding when a notorious villain becomes a force for good, or at least a provider of ingredients for positive work."}]}

The two leaders committed to exploring ways to expand these services in the near future. \n\nCanada and China agreed to further engage and collaborate on pressing regional and global challenges, exchanging views on North Korea and Myanmar. \n\nThe inaugural meeting of the Canada-China Joint Committee on Culture will be co-chaired by ministers from both countries in Ottawa in February 2018. This platform will provide an opportunity for high-level dialogue on matters of mutual interest in culture, creative industries, the arts, heritage, and other areas. \n\nCooperation on the rule of law and labor is one of Canada's priorities in China. To further this goal, the Prime Minister announced $5 million to deepen judicial cooperation and an additional $1.5 million to support work on labor and employment issues."}]}

It is justified for the government to take action against these individuals. They took advantage of a hastily designed program that lacked sufficient safeguards while exploiting the generosity of the Canadian people. The program inadvertently incentivized individuals to cease employment and resist returning when their employers requested, and now they seek to retain funds they knowingly obtained while ineligible.\n\nThe reality is that pandemic relief programs, such as the CERB, were swiftly implemented with strong encouragement from the government to apply and ensure safety. The rules underwent multiple changes in the initial stages, and even now, conflicting legacy rules can be found online. Recipients of social assistance, constituting approximately 5% of Canada's population or 1 in 20 people, were frequently mandated by law to apply for the CERB and faced potential penalties and sanctions for non-compliance. Moreover, pandemic benefits were largely offset by reducing other benefits received.\n\nSubsequently, stricter measures were implemented regarding pandemic benefits in the following ways: \n\n1. The $5,000 income threshold was limited to incomes specifically outlined in the legislation, which proved more restrictive than what was originally communicated on websites. For instance, honorariums were listed as qualifying income online but were not covered in the CERB legislation.\n\n2. The $5,000 income had to be received, not merely earned. Many individuals worked but did not receive their pay due to business distress and closures caused by the pandemic. However, those who earned money but did not receive it retroactively became ineligible for the CERB. This rule seems illogical, as the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) typically does not accept any explanations for difficulties in obtaining documentation of earnings unless they are taken to tax court.\n\n3. CERB claimants were retrospectively required by the tax court to provide meticulous bookkeeping records to prove their eligibility. Inability to produce detailed accounts often resulted in ineligibility.\n\n4. Claimants who narrowly missed meeting the eligibility criteria faced sanctions. The rules allowed no exceptions or room for judges to determine eligibility, unlike most programs where exceptions are common. Exceptionality, which is typically present in various programs, is entirely absent in the case of pandemic benefits.\n\n5. The norms surrounding hardship rules, which usually offer greater leeway for extended payment terms, have been significantly tightened.\n\n6. The federal budget allocated over $50 million to pursue low-income individuals who were found ineligible for benefits, despite the plethora of contradictions in communication materials and administration. \n\nUnfortunately, the focus on these matters is overshadowing Canada's remarkable achievement of meeting its poverty goals nearly a decade ahead of schedule. Rather than celebrating this incredible accomplishment, some view it as an unsuccessful experiment in protecting our most vulnerable residents, which is an erroneous perception."}]}

The Government of Canada recognizes the recurring theme that citizen engagement must be authentic and meaningful. To address this, we have developed a set of principles and guidelines to ensure transparency, relevance, inclusivity, accountability, and adaptability in our engagement on policy issues.\n\nOur journey to these principles began with a large engagement process in 2013, wherein we sought input to support the development of Canada's second action plan on open government. Through conversations with Canadians, we identified concerns regarding meaningful engagement, which led us to commit to developing principles and standards for public consultations in collaboration with citizens and civil society.\n\nTo fulfill this commitment, we started by conducting an environmental scan to understand global practices. We then engaged with the federal government's regulatory community through workshops and discussed the issue with the academic community at a congress in June 2015. Subsequently, the Canadian Open Dialogue Forum became a platform where we collaborated with over 200 participants from civil society, government, academia, and business to co-create a set of principles during a two-day conference in March 2016.\n\nThroughout this process, we had ongoing consultations, refining and editing the principles to ensure both the government and our community were satisfied. We acknowledge that we made mistakes along the way and needed to make adjustments, even after extensive discussions. For instance, at the GovMaker event in 2016, we proposed a principle stating that \"participants should know what's on and off the table\" to enhance relevance. However, we recognized the consensus in the room that if the process is truly \"open,\" nothing should be entirely off the table. We also heard the need for co-creation of engagement processes and shared accountability, which we have incorporated into the principles.\n\nThe outcome of this endeavor is a set of principles that guide engagement between the government and citizens. We are currently experimenting with applying these principles to public consultations and developing more detailed guidance on their implementation. Furthermore, we are working towards using these principles as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of various public engagement activities conducted by the Government of Canada. A significant focus of our efforts is strengthening relationships and engagement with Indigenous peoples and nations.\n\nWe invite you to stay tuned for a future blog post that will delve into measuring the effectiveness of these principles and exploring the relationship between engagement and trust in government. Thank you, and we are eager to continue learning together.\n\nThom Kearney and the Open Government Team"}]}

These materials, typically presented in the form of dashboards, heat maps, and concise progress reports, outline advancements made on key priorities and address areas that require attention. For instance, our reports have highlighted progress in gender-based budgeting and analysis across the system, as well as improved recruitment of underrepresented groups in Canada's uniformed and security agencies. However, they have also identified areas where further progress is needed. Conducting brief stock take meetings with the Prime Minister and key leaders, supported by data, has proven to be an effective way to expedite progress. Consequently, there is now enhanced clarity across the public service that the Prime Minister expects targets to be met, and rigorous gender-based analysis and budgeting are required for all new proposals. In practice, this means that proposals will undergo thorough assessments to evaluate their differential impact on various groups, such as women or racialized communities. We will soon finalize our approach to publicly sharing these reports on the results we produce for the Prime Minister.\n\nSecondly, we provide assistance to departments as they develop new policy and program submissions. Our focus revolves around three fundamental questions: What are the intended outcomes? How will they be achieved? And how will progress be evaluated and adjustments made if necessary? Our role primarily involves providing guidance to departments on their submissions to the Cabinet, but it can also entail a more detailed examination of their programs. Recently, we have collaborated with departments to clarify their policy goals and evaluation strategies on various issues, including homelessness reduction, expanding broadband coverage in remote and rural communities, addressing the opioid crisis, improving job training program outcomes, and reducing the federal government's carbon footprint.\n\nThirdly, we closely collaborate with departments on a day-to-day basis to assist ministers in overcoming obstacles to the successful implementation of their initiatives within the system. Instead of allowing problems to persist, we bring them to light, direct them to the appropriate decision-making forums, and strive to expedite progress. In some cases, we conduct in-depth analyses of high-priority issues that are not progressing as expected. This involves examining the overall delivery chain and considering all partners and policies that may either aid or hinder successful implementation. Examples of such endeavors include exploring the complexities surrounding long-term boil water advisories on reserves. This multifaceted issue has proven challenging to resolve; therefore, a joint team composed of representatives from different departments, the PCO (Privy Council Office), and communities has been mapping out the delivery chain and identifying the underlying challenges.\n\nPreviously, these three functions were not systematically performed across the federal government. While they were occasionally undertaken in response to specific situations, they lacked a consistent and ongoing approach. All three functions are designed to support a larger objective \u2013 shifting the culture of the federal government towards a heightened focus on implementation issues and outcomes. This entails investing more in individuals capable of delivering programs and projects, as well as allocating additional resources to data collection and evaluation to determine the results being achieved. Therefore, \"Results & Delivery\" is not just the name of our unit \u2013 it encapsulates our mission each day. I suppose we are somewhat self-explanatory: an \"autonym\".\n\nThis blog will serve as a platform for me to describe our ongoing activities and discuss the challenges the public service encounters as we strive towards becoming a more outcomes-focused organization. In my next post, I will delve into our approach to public reporting and what lies ahead."}]}

Advances in technology and communications, along with increasing public expectations, have created a strong argument for governments to be open and transparent. Open data, in particular, has a significant role to play in this movement. Over the next decade, data will fundamentally change the way we live, work, and think. For example, real-time transport data apps have become common, providing citizens with information on train and bus schedules. Additionally, data on school and doctor performance has empowered citizens to voice their opinions and make informed choices about public services. The possibilities for open data are endless.\n\nThe UK government is committed to being a leader in transparency and open data. With over 10,000 datasets available on the Data.gov.uk website, the government has made significant progress in releasing data. However, simply releasing data is not enough. It must also be easily accessible, user-friendly, and shareable. Given the vast amount of data that the government holds, it is crucial to prioritize what will be most valuable. To achieve this, the government has been consulting with citizens, businesses, and civil society to identify the core data that should be made available to developers and entrepreneurs. This approach will stimulate economic growth and foster information-led businesses.\n\nThe UK, along with Canada and other international partners, is part of a global movement that supports transparency and open government. This movement took a significant step forward at the G8 summit in June, where all member states signed an open data charter. This charter commits governments to making their data widely accessible in a format that can be used by all. It also establishes an expectation that all government data should be published openly by default. Furthermore, the UK and Canada are participants in the Open Government Partnership (OGP), which is a worldwide initiative involving 60 countries. The OGP aims to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies.\n\nThe recent joint UK-Canada Google Hangout on open data highlights our commitment to transparency and accountability in our own governments. Both countries will be publishing OGP national action plans in support of the open data charter. Additionally, we seek to collaborate further to expand the release and use of open data, including encouraging more countries to adopt the G8 charter and promoting public sector engagement to drive innovation and growth. The theme of open data will be a central focus of the upcoming OGP annual summit, which the UK is hosting. This event will bring together world leaders and representatives from civil society to share success stories, review progress made on transparency commitments, and set new ambitious goals for openness.\n\nThe collaboration, sharing of best practices, and open scrutiny of governments' progress that the OGP enables are essential for establishing transparency as a credible catalyst for change. Events like the Hangout with Minister Clement provide valuable opportunities to promote transparency and open data and gather insights and ideas from various sources. I hope this is just the beginning of many such initiatives."}]}

This question is not only important to my role but also to the daily lives of all Canadian citizens. I recently addressed this question in an article titled \"The Government of Canada's Information Technology Strategic Plan,\" published in the August 2017 edition of the Public Sector Digest.\n\nMy main message is clear: in this digital and interconnected era, we must completely rethink the government's operating model. Rather than a linear approach where public services are solely provided by public servants, we need to view the government as an exponential platform. Information should be available and utilized by third parties to deliver services to citizens on behalf of the government.\n\nUnfortunately, the Government of Canada has operated in an environment where information is not released by default, partnerships are not easily formed, and linear approaches hinder our ability to serve citizens. That's why we released our Information Technology Strategic Plan for 2016-2020. This plan aims to leverage technology's impact on the federal ecosystem by focusing on how we manage our technological assets, develop our workforce, and govern our enterprise. It is a step towards adapting more quickly to rapid societal developments.\n\nWhile we will continue to invest federal funding in areas like superclusters and artificial intelligence, we must capitalize on these investments sooner. We must also prioritize open government and service agendas to enable our government to function as a platform. In the article, I outlined some forward paths, including modernizing our engagement tools, building proper technology architecture, adopting innovative procurement approaches, and enhancing collaboration with partners. All of these efforts aim to create a more open government.\n\nMost importantly, we must place people at the center of our efforts. We need a public service that embraces new approaches and empowers our employees to think digitally. This requires a fundamental change in our organization to adapt to both traditional needs and new realities. As the Government of Canada's CIO, I am excited to work with my team to modernize the public service technology landscape for the benefit of all Canadian citizens."}]}

We are proud to report that we are fulfilling this commitment. It is crucial for Canadians, as well as their elected representatives, to have access to information regarding the allocation and use of public funds. Transparency in financial matters is fundamental to a healthy representative democracy. That is why our government has recently implemented significant changes to enhance the clarity, transparency, and accountability of government spending.\n\nTraditionally, the government presents its spending plans for the upcoming year through the main estimates, which are tabled in Parliament. However, this process has led to confusion as initiatives announced in the federal budget were often excluded from the main estimates. To address this issue, we have reorganized the order of these documents. Now, the main estimates are presented after the budget, and we have included a budget implementation vote within the main estimates. This marks the first time in recent history that the main estimates, which I presented on April 16th, encompass 100% of the measures outlined in the budget for this year. This allows parliamentarians to have more accurate and detailed information, enabling them to hold the government accountable for its spending of taxpayer dollars. This represents a significant advancement in government accountability.\n\nTo achieve this, we have introduced a new centrally managed budget implementation vote in the main estimates. As per the law, the Treasury Board, the cabinet committee responsible for allocating funds to departments, can only assign these funds to specific new budget measures outlined in the budget's comprehensive list of funding for each spending initiative. Any other use of public funds would be unauthorized. Renowned economists Scott Clark and Peter Devries have given Budget 2018 an \"A\" grade for fiscal credibility, praising its transparency and detailed financial analysis. Auditor General Michael Ferguson has also emphasized the importance of adhering to the allocation of funds as specified in the budget.\n\nWe are providing Parliament with a clear breakdown of where the funding for the new budget implementation vote originates from within the budget and how it will be utilized. Parliamentarians can now directly trace the money from this central vote to a specific line in the budget and the main estimates, ensuring transparency and accountability. Additionally, to enhance clarity, we will include the allocations from Annex 1 of the main estimates directly in the supply bill, which will be voted on by Parliament this spring.\n\nThis heightened transparency is made possible by the unprecedented level of detail provided in the budget regarding new spending measures by each department. Furthermore, we will provide monthly online reports and supplementary estimates throughout the year to demonstrate precisely how the Treasury Board is allocating funds to departments for specific budget initiatives.\n\nTo illustrate the efficacy of this system, let us consider the new women entrepreneurship strategy, aimed at promoting the growth of women-owned businesses and job creation. Through our new monthly online reporting, Canadians can track the funds allocated to this strategy, categorized by federal agency, as we expand our support for women in business.\n\nThroughout the process of reforming the estimates, I have actively engaged with my fellow parliamentarians in a transparent and constructive manner through multiple committee appearances. Thanks to these crucial changes, parliamentarians now possess greater oversight of government spending than ever before. I firmly believe that these reforms will result in a more transparent and accountable government that benefits all Canadians."}]}

In many of these settings, I have also instructed on benefit design and have even written a comprehensive guide on understanding benefit design and the ten principles of good benefit design.\n\nUnfortunately, the CERB and CRB programs do not adhere to four of these ten principles. However, I do not place blame solely on the designers. It is nearly impossible to create such a large suite of programs without making some mistakes and taking shortcuts. Nevertheless, Canada was rightfully praised for the scale, efficiency, and speed at which it implemented its pandemic benefits.\n\nWhen speed is of the essence, the principles of effective benefit delivery may not be the primary concern. However, as I mentioned earlier, two wrongs don't make a right. While errors may occur during the initial rollout, there is an opportunity to rectify them through appeals. This is exemplified by the government's actions in assisting students, the self-employed, and low-income seniors. These cases form the basis of my objections in this series.\n\nLet's now examine the violations that occurred as the CERB and CRB programs were hastily implemented. The first principle I propose is aligning program objectives with the design. The primary objective of the pandemic benefits was to ensure people's safety by keeping them indoors during the early stages of the pandemic. Another objective was to assist individuals who lost their jobs and were unable to resume work. However, the CERB and CRB only provided benefits to those who earned at least $5,000 in 2019, which does not align with the first principle. Many people with lower earnings also experienced job loss and were forced to work during the most dangerous period of the pandemic. Furthermore, the $5,000 threshold was arbitrary and lacked a basis in Canadian values.\n\nThe second principle is aligning Canadian values with design parameters. I have yet to encounter a Canadian value that mandates restricting pandemic benefits to individuals who earned over $5,000. Canadians believe in supporting those who have lost their jobs, as evidenced by our existing employment insurance and welfare programs. Therefore, the second design principle is not met, primarily due to the arbitrary nature of the $5,000 threshold.\n\nThe third principle involves understanding benefit structure. The CERB and CRB demonstrated remarkable innovation, but it is challenging to determine if the benefits reached the intended recipients. The rules surrounding income eligibility changed after the benefits were implemented, causing confusion regarding what counted as income, who was eligible, when benefits were granted, and how they were distributed. However, it is difficult to argue that the CERB and CRB violated the principle of understanding benefit structure, as there was insufficient time to thoroughly study and refine it.\n\nThe fourth principle is perhaps the most crucial, which is understanding the four elements of an income test. In the case of the CERB and CRB, there is an absence of a recovery or tax-back rate on income. There is no gradual transition or exit strategy. Either an individual is eligible or they are not. Missing the threshold by even a cent renders one ineligible, while exceeding it by a cent makes them eligible. This lack of on and off ramps, even in a rushed design process, constitutes a violation of a fundamental principle.\n\nIn conclusion, while the CERB and CRB programs were implemented rapidly and achieved significant results, they do fall short in adhering to certain principles of good benefit design. Recognizing these violations will allow us to improve the future design and implementation of similar programs."}]}

This major public transit initiative aims to connect various suburbs to downtown Montr\u00e9al. With the introduction of Phase 1, five stations now provide transportation services from Brossard Station on the south shore to Central Station in downtown Montr\u00e9al, spanning the St. Lawrence River via the iconic Samuel de Champlain Bridge.\n\nThe REM is the largest public transit project undertaken in Quebec in the past 50 years and is the result of extensive collaboration, including an unprecedented investment by the Canada Infrastructure Bank. Once fully completed, the REM will double the length of the existing metro system, connecting communities such as Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue in the west island and Laval and Deux-Montagnes in the north shore to downtown Montr\u00e9al. Furthermore, it will facilitate quick access to Montr\u00e9al-Trudeau International Airport. The REM will allow travelers to reach one of Canada's largest air travel hubs in just 25 minutes, regardless of traffic.\n\nAs a fully electric metro system, the REM will help reduce emissions by 100,000 tonnes annually, equivalent to removing 30,000 cars from the roads every day. Additionally, it is expected to generate significant economic benefits for the greater Montr\u00e9al area, including the creation of 34,000 jobs during construction and 1,000 permanent jobs, with over $2 billion in wages paid in Quebec. Once operational, the REM is projected to serve up to 170,000 users per day.\n\nProjects like the REM are integral to our comprehensive strategy to combat climate change, promote employment opportunities, and enhance the quality of life in our communities. Today's announcement signifies that Montreal residents will benefit from a faster commute, reduced traffic congestion, cleaner air, and increased savings.\n\nTo provide some specific details:\n1. Phase 1 will accommodate approximately 30,000 daily commuters, covering a distance of 16.6 kilometers in just 18 minutes.\n2. Upon completion, the REM will include 26 stations and extend the length of Montr\u00e9al's current metro network by 67 kilometers, effectively doubling its size.\n3. The Canada Infrastructure Bank is making a record investment of $1.28 billion in the REM project, along with an additional $300 million for the construction of the REM terminus station at Montr\u00e9al-Trudeau International Airport. The Government of Canada's Airport Critical Infrastructure Program is also contributing an extra $100 million towards the airport's REM station.\n4. With a total project cost of $6.9 billion, the REM is the result of a strong partnership between the Government of Canada, Canada Infrastructure Bank, CDPQ Infra, REM Inc., the Government of Quebec, A\u00e9roports de Montr\u00e9al, and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec.\n5. Established in 2017 under the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act, the Canada Infrastructure Bank seeks to invest in significant infrastructure projects that have a transformative impact, generate revenue, and align with public interests while fostering sustainable economic growth.\n6. Since 2015, the Government of Canada has invested over $22 billion in more than 1,800 public transit projects nationwide. These investments are expected to result in the construction of over 400 kilometers of new subway and light rail lines, the procurement of over 3,000 zero-emission buses, and the development of nearly 1,700 kilometers of active transportation trails, bike lanes, pedestrian paths, and recreational routes."}]}

We collaborated with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Veterans Affairs Canada, and Statistics Canada to investigate their usage of the global theme and topic menu on Canada.ca. We discovered that some institutions found the menu insufficient for their complex navigation needs, which hindered their adoption of the Canada.ca design. To find a solution, we needed to explore navigation habits as a whole and develop a strategy to effectively meet user needs.\n\nThe wayfinding project consisted of a baseline study to identify and assess findability issues, as well as a comparison study to test potential solutions. Our findings influenced changes to the Canada.ca design. Through research and prototyping activities, we explored options to remove the menu while maintaining or enhancing the effectiveness of global navigation. It was also crucial for us to uphold the confidence and trust associated with the Canada.ca brand.\n\nOur prototype incorporated the following design elements for testing purposes:\n1. A global header without a menu\n2. Theme links moved from the menu to the footer\n3. Inclusion of a sign-in button in the global header\n4. More prominent breadcrumb links\n5. Implementation of a simplified theme page template\n\nWe applied the new design to pages already utilizing the Canada.ca design, as well as those that were not. Task success remained consistent, and there was even an improvement in navigating between themes. This consistency can be attributed to the fact that breadcrumbs are used more frequently than the global menu for navigation. When clear links to theme-level pages are provided in the breadcrumb, users can easily find their intended destination. Additionally, we discovered that people often use the menu to locate the sign-in page. Given that signing in is a top task on Canada.ca, we incorporated a contextual sign-in button on relevant pages, placed at the top-right below the global header, where users typically expect to find it. This implementation proved successful, as task success was maintained or improved during the comparison round of testing. For more detailed information, please refer to our research summary.\n\nGiven that Canada.ca is a website heavily relied upon by individuals on a daily basis, we are taking a transitional approach to minimize disruption for users while implementing these design improvements to our navigation. Some of the work has already been completed, and more is currently in progress. Here is our roll-out plan:\n\n1. Updates to the Canada.ca homepage: Our analysis of footer usage patterns on the homepage versus other pages revealed that some footer links were heavily used on the homepage but rarely accessed elsewhere on the site. As a result, we have relocated these links from the footer to the content section of the homepage. This change increases their visibility where users actually engage with them and creates additional space in the footer for more suitable links.\n\n2. Contextual sign-in button: The global header now includes a contextual sign-in button as an optional element. This button will be present on pages where users are likely seeking to sign in to their accounts. Our research indicated that many people used the global menu to access the sign-in page. By presenting a sign-in button in the top right of the content area, we make the sign-in process more prominent and easy to locate when signing in is a top task. As users become accustomed to seeing and using the sign-in button consistently below the header, they will rely less on the menu to access and sign in to their accounts.\n\n3. Footer updates: To further reduce reliance on the theme and topic menu, we have made adjustments to the global footer. The new global footer will consist of three content bands."}]}

Based on these findings, we have made the decision to discontinue the use of carousels on our website and have observed similar behaviors when working with other organizations. Additionally, carousels can be distracting and inconvenient, causing users to lose focus and potentially miss important information. In order to create a more accessible and inclusive user experience, it is crucial to prioritize user needs and provide content that is easily readable and controllable.

However, it can be challenging to prioritize user-centric design when faced with tight deadlines and financial constraints. Building digital services that truly meet user needs requires a thorough understanding of who our users are, their needs, and the impact our services have on their lives.\n\nOne valuable resource in gaining insights from various user groups is our call centers. Whether they are in-house or outsourced, call center agents have access to a wealth of customer feedback, including complaints, grievances, praise, and product insights. Leveraging this data allows us to improve our web content and services while keeping real people in mind.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of collaborating with call center staff, let's consider how their input helped us make swift content improvements for better service delivery on Canada.ca. In March 2020, our call centers experienced a significant surge in calls and emails related to employment insurance (EI) and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). The overwhelming call volumes at the government's main 1-800 O Canada number and Service Canada's email system made headlines, causing concern among Canadians who had to wait for hours to receive assistance.\n\nTo address this issue, Service Canada sought assistance from the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) to enhance their phone and email contact pages. The goal was to encourage more self-service behavior among visitors to the website, building on our success in improving contact pages for the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to reduce call volumes.\n\nTo assess the impact of our interventions, we used web analytics and call volumes in early April 2020 as a baseline measurement. At that time, call wait times exceeded several hours, and many individuals were unable to connect. Additionally, email response times were delayed beyond the standard 48-hour window, and the Public Health Agency's call center was redirecting hundreds of calls daily concerning CERB and EI topics.\n\nBased on user behavior, we hypothesized that visitors to the contact page were not reading the lengthy alert at the top and were reluctant to explore other pages for answers. This was likely because they had already decided to seek direct contact. To address this, we prototyped and tested two ideas. Firstly, we implemented a smaller alert banner at the top of the page, consisting of a concise sentence encouraging users to search for answers on the page before calling. Secondly, we placed answers to frequently asked questions at the top of the page using the expand/collapse pattern, allowing users to access specific answers without leaving the page.\n\nTesting these solutions yielded positive results. Users actively looked for answers on the page and successfully found them. By implementing a shorter and more user-friendly design, we were able to provide the most relevant content while maintaining a simple and streamlined page layout.\""}]}

This update aims to enhance the learning environment and promote greater student engagement.\n\nUnder the revised code, the use of personal mobile devices during instructional time is permitted under the following circumstances:\n\n1. For educational purposes, as directed by an educator.\n2. For health and medical purposes.\n3. To support special education needs.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to highlight that, as per the Ontario Human Rights Code, school boards have a duty to provide appropriate accommodations to students, employees, and educators. Should a student or staff member require the use of a personal mobile device as an accommodation, school boards are obligated to allow such arrangements.\n\nThis memorandum also provides guidance for school boards on reviewing their own codes of conduct, as well as the local codes of conduct in their schools. It is crucial for boards to ensure that their codes align with the revised provincial code of conduct.\n\nPlease note that subsection 301(2) of Part XIII of the Education Act outlines the purposes of the provincial code of conduct. Additionally, according to subsection 301(3.1), if a board enters into an agreement with a third party for the rental of school space or the provision of before- and after-school programs, the board must require the third party to follow standards consistent with the provincial code of conduct.\n\nWe firmly believe that a school should foster responsibility, respect, civility, and academic excellence within a safe learning and teaching environment. A positive school climate is achieved when all members of the school community feel safe, included, accepted, and actively promote positive behaviors and interactions.\n\nBuilding and maintaining a positive school climate is indeed a complex challenge, but evidence-informed solutions and a whole-school approach involving all stakeholders are vital for success. This approach allows for systemic changes that benefit all students and the broader community.\n\nEvery student, parent, teacher, and school staff member has the right to feel safe and be safe within their school community. It is our shared responsibility to contribute to a positive school climate that supports student achievement and well-being. For this reason, school boards are encouraged to focus on prevention and early intervention strategies to address inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe provincial code of conduct establishes clear standards of behavior, which are applicable to students in all educational settings, including virtual learning environments, school buses, school-related events or activities, before- and after-school programs, and any other circumstances that may impact the school climate. These standards of behavior also apply to all individuals involved in the publicly funded school system, such as principals, teachers, early childhood educators, school staff, parents, school bus drivers, volunteers, and members of various community groups.\n\nResponsible citizenship entails active participation in the civic life of the school community. Engaged citizens possess awareness of their rights but, more importantly, accept the responsibility of protecting their own rights as well as the rights of others.\n\nIn light of this update, we kindly request that all school boards ensure the following:\n\n1. Your codes of conduct are up to date and consistent with the revised provincial code of conduct outlined in this memorandum.\n2. Your codes of conduct comply with all Ministry of Education policies, the requirements of the Education Act, its regulations, and other applicable legislation, including the Ontario Human Rights Code.\n3. Your codes of conduct are made readily available to the public, either through your school board's website or an appropriate alternative if no website is available.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. We appreciate your continued commitment to providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for all.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n[Your Organization]"}]}

This reminder comes after the release of an auditor-general's report which concluded that the government's removal of lands from the protected greenbelt favored certain developers. The memo, signed by Premier Doug Ford's Chief of Staff, Patrick Sackville, and Ontario's top civil servant, Secretary of the Cabinet Michelle Diemanuele, was shared with reporters on Monday.\n\nThe memo, addressed to the chiefs of staff for members of cabinet and deputy ministers, emphasizes the importance of following the Public Service of Ontario Act, which includes rules regarding conflict of interest and political activity. It also requires public servants to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. The memo states that a comprehensive response to the auditor's report is being prepared, with a working group overseeing its implementation.\n\nThe purpose of this memo is to address several recommendations made by Auditor-General Bonnie Lysyk in her 93-page report. Lysyk declared that the greenbelt decision was biased and seriously flawed, lacking the necessary environmental and financial analysis. The government has accepted all but one of her recommendations, specifically the call to revisit the greenbelt decision itself.\n\nThe memo further advises ministers' chiefs of staff to ensure that proposals submitted to cabinet or its committees provide accurate and complete information, including outlining options and risks. It emphasizes the importance of consultation, including with indigenous leaders. This is in response to Lysyk's observation that vital details regarding the greenbelt proposal were missing, and that the land was primarily chosen by Ryan Amato, the chief of staff to the minister of municipal affairs and housing, rather than apolitical civil servants. The report reveals that Amato, appointed by the premier's office, received submissions from developers that accounted for the majority of the removals from the greenbelt.\n\nIn response to another recommendation, the premier's office has asked the integrity commissioner to investigate whether Mr. Amato broke any rules in his dealings with developers. The memo also addresses the issue of non-disclosure agreements that were signed by civil servants involved in the greenbelt decision, making it impossible for them to consult municipalities or other experts. Chiefs of staff are now instructed to report any proposed use of confidentiality agreements to the cabinet office or the treasury board secretariat.\n\nThe memo concludes by reminding chiefs of staff to follow existing requirements to document any materials or proposals received from individuals outside of the government, particularly in light of the submissions made by developers.\n\nThe opposition NDP has dismissed the memo as government spin, claiming that it is an attempt to deflect blame for the greenbelt removals. The government has been actively countering the information in Lysyk's report through a recent communications push.\n\nThe memo was released shortly after Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy defended the government's decision to remove 3,000 hectares from the greenbelt, despite the findings of the audit. Bethlenfalvy stated that this decision was necessary due to the housing crisis and dismissed expert reports suggesting that Ontario already had enough land for housing. He cited recent numbers showing a significant increase in the province's population as justification for the decision."}]}

I have dedicated my studies to analyzing social and economic policy, and I have proudly called northern Scarborough my home for the past 44 years. \n\nThroughout the new millennium, I have had the privilege of serving as the president of a Canadian non-profit board, as well as the chair of an Ontario agency. Currently, I am honored to chair an Ontario commission. These experiences have provided me with a deep understanding of living within the guidelines and limitations set by the government. \n\nHowever, I also recognize that as individuals, we have the power to make choices. Based on my observations, it seems that rather than making choices, you have merely expressed apologies for the constraints that govern your decision-making. \n\nI have personally witnessed numerous electoral boundary changes throughout my life, but the year 2018 marked a significant milestone for Scarborough. It was the first time in living memory that all of our electoral boundaries at every level of government aligned. This achievement brought about a new level of transparency and fairness to our electoral process in Scarborough. \n\nNow, your commission is proposing changes not only within Scarborough's boundaries but also to Scarborough's boundaries themselves. This comes after the electoral boundaries were already modified in 2013. These proposed changes not only undermine our democracy in Scarborough but also diminish Toronto's overall participation. \n\nAt the Scarborough Community Renewal Organization (SCRO), we have taken the time to understand the reasoning behind these proposed changes. We comprehend the algorithm for change, the shifts in population, and the constraints that influence the proposal of new boundaries and a reduction in seats. However, whether other boundaries remain the same or change, this will inevitably result in either confusion or upheaval. \n\nIf provincial and municipal boundaries undergo changes, the upheaval will be even more significant. Conversely, if they remain unchanged, the boundaries will be out of sync. \n\nI need not delve into detail regarding the negative impact of the proposed changes. However, I would like to touch on some key points that have been highlighted in recent media reports. Since 2011, the city of Toronto has welcomed over 179,000 new residents, surpassing the population of Prince Edward Island. Yet, while PEI is represented by four seats in the House of Commons, retaining the same number of Members of Parliament in the next election, Toronto is set to lose one seat. \n\nOver the past decade, Ontario has experienced a population growth of nearly two million people, equivalent to the combined populations of New Brunswick and Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan, with its 1.2 million residents, is allocated 14 seats, or roughly 84,000 residents per riding. New Brunswick, with a population of 789,225, is granted 10 seats, or approximately 79,000 residents per riding. In 2011, Ontario's 12.9 million people were entitled to 121 seats, averaging around 106,000 people per riding. Despite growing by nearly two million people, Ontario is only receiving one additional seat. \n\nThe commission has stated that it must reduce Toronto's districts by one but add two outside the city limits due to faster population growth in the surrounding suburbs. The commission justifies proposing numerous new boundaries by claiming the need to address significant disparities in voter equality that have emerged across the province in the past decade, as stated by Justice Lynne Leitch, the chairperson of the commission, in an August 19 release. \n\nWith this proposed change, Scarborough-Agincourt would be divided, dispersing a significant portion of our community into North York and erasing any reference to historical Agincourt. Moreover, Scarborough as a whole would lose an entire riding, as this proposal significantly impacts Scarborough North and a sizable portion of Scarborough-Agincourt, consolidating our community into a new riding called Scarborough Northwest."}]}

Additionally, Baker Tilly Canada, one of the largest associations of chartered professional accounting firms in the country, has produced a guide outlining financial relief measures available to those impacted economically by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nBudget 2021 includes the extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) until September 2021.

This memo aims to provide you with the necessary information regarding this update.\n\nThe use of personal mobile devices during instructional time is now permitted only under specific circumstances. These include:\n\n1. For educational purposes, as directed by an educator.\n2. For health and medical purposes.\n3. To support special education needs.\n\nIt is important to note that school boards have a duty under the Ontario Human Rights Code to provide appropriate accommodations to students, employees, and educators. If a student or staff member requires the use of a personal mobile device as an accommodation, it is the obligation of the school board to allow such accommodation.\n\nAdditionally, this memo provides guidance to school boards on reviewing their own codes of conduct as well as the local codes of conduct in their schools. It is essential for boards to ensure that their codes of conduct align with the revised provincial code of conduct.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that subsection 301(2) of Part XIII of the Education Act outlines the purposes of the provincial code of conduct. Furthermore, in accordance with subsection 301(3.1), if a board enters into an agreement with a third party for the rental of school space or the provision of before- and after-school programs, it is required to include a clause in the agreement that mandates adherence to standards consistent with the provincial code of conduct.\n\nA school should always strive to be a place that promotes responsibility, respect, civility, and academic excellence in a safe learning and teaching environment. A positive school climate is achieved when all members of the school community feel safe, included, and accepted, and actively promote positive behaviors and interactions. Building and sustaining such a climate is a complex challenge that requires evidence-informed solutions. It is crucial to adopt a whole-school approach, involving all members of the school community, to support efforts in creating safe, inclusive, and accepting schools. This approach is effective in making systemic changes that benefit all students and the broader community.\n\nIt is the right of all students, parents, teachers, and other school staff to be safe and feel safe within their school community. With this right comes the responsibility to contribute to a positive school climate. School boards should prioritize prevention and early intervention strategies to address inappropriate behavior and foster a positive school climate that supports student achievement and well-being.\n\nThe provincial code of conduct establishes clear standards of behavior that apply to students in various settings, including school property, virtual learning environments, school buses, school-related events or activities, before- and after-school programs, and other circumstances that impact the school climate. These standards also apply to all individuals involved in the publicly funded school system, including principals, teachers, early childhood educators, other school staff, parents, school bus drivers, volunteers, and members of various community groups.\n\nResponsible citizenship entails appropriate participation in the civic life of the school community. Active and engaged citizens understand their rights and, more importantly, accept the responsibility to protect their rights and the rights of others.\n\nBy adhering to the revised provincial code of conduct, we can create a positive and inclusive school environment that benefits everyone involved.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"}]}

These events are regularly experienced in communities across Canada and are expected to continue as our country is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the world, creating ideal conditions for more frequent and longer wildfires. The wildfire season typically runs from early April to late October.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of wildfires makes it difficult to determine when they will occur, how large they will be, how much smoke they will generate, and the direction the smoke will travel. In fact, wildfire smoke can be carried hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from the fire zone, meaning that smoke from other parts of the world can impact Canadian communities.\n\nCertain individuals are at a higher risk of experiencing health problems when exposed to wildfire smoke, including seniors, pregnant people, smokers, infants and young children, people who work outdoors, people involved in strenuous outdoor exercise, and those with existing illnesses or chronic health conditions. However, during heavy smoke conditions, everyone is at risk regardless of age or health, and it is important to exercise caution when spending time outdoors during a wildfire smoke event.\n\nTo protect oneself, it is advisable to check the local air quality conditions, including the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), special air quality statements, and other indicators of smoke levels in the community. Limiting outdoor activities and strenuous physical activities is recommended. Staying indoors with windows and doors closed is crucial, and if possible, utilizing air conditioning to keep the indoor environment cool and clean. For those without air conditioning, seeking out local cooling or clean air spaces is important. Using a portable air purifier in a frequently used room can help reduce the fine particles from wildfire smoke. Additionally, it is suggested to limit the use of exhaust fans when not cooking.\n\nIf maintaining clean and cool air indoors is not possible during a wildfire smoke event, it is advisable to find safe places in the community with air conditioning and filtered air, such as libraries, shopping malls, community centers, or cleaner air shelters. It is recommended to contact local health or emergency authorities to obtain up-to-date information about publicly accessible locations.\n\nDuring a smoke event, it is not uncommon to experience feelings of anxiety, stress, sadness, or isolation. Taking care of oneself by eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising indoors, and staying in contact with friends can help alleviate these symptoms. Seeking help from a healthcare provider is encouraged for individuals struggling to cope with stress, anxiety, or depression.\n\nIf spending time outdoors is necessary, wearing a well-fitted respirator type mask, such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator, can help reduce exposure to fine particles in smoke. However, it's important to note that respirators do not reduce exposure to gases in wildfire smoke. Listening to your body and reducing or stopping activities if experiencing symptoms is crucial.\n\nIf smoke persists for an extended period, staying active when possible is recommended. Finding a location with clean air to exercise indoors, such as a gym, community center, or home, can be beneficial. For those who need to work outdoors, consulting provincial or territorial occupational health and safety organizations or local health authorities for guidance on working safely during wildfire smoke events is advised.\n\nIn summary, while wildfire smoke events can pose health risks, being proactive in assessing air quality, taking necessary precautions, and seeking assistance if needed can help mitigate these risks."}]}

While the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many of these challenges, it has also provided youth with additional free time, leading to a rise in entrepreneurship. Consequently, youth are seeking government assistance in expanding their networks, accessing entry-level opportunities, managing student debt, and ensuring equal opportunities for all.\n\nBarriers to Employment:\nYouth encounter numerous obstacles that hinder their access to employment, such as limited access to technology, professional networks, and career development opportunities. Unfortunately, these barriers disproportionately affect youth from low-income or marginalized communities. Additionally, many youth are unable to find work in their preferred language due to a shortage of suitable employment options. As a result, having a strong network becomes essential for accessing certain opportunities.\n\nCareer Aspirations:\nYouth express a need for stability, work-life balance, and relevant work experiences in their career paths. However, the scarcity of entry-level jobs makes it challenging for them to envision potential career options. The lack of college, job, or university experience further compounds this issue. Consequently, many youth choose to postpone graduation or pursue further education due to the increased stress of unemployment.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly diminished job opportunities, making them scarce and highly competitive. Consequently, youth experience demotivation and stress. Moreover, the lack of social interaction has taken a toll on individuals' mental well-being, as remote work eliminates the social outlets that were previously available. However, on a positive note, the limited employment options have sparked an increase in entrepreneurial ventures, as many youth have found the motivation and resources to create their own companies and initiatives.\n\nFinancial Concerns:\nYouth are facing significant financial challenges, struggling to meet their financial obligations. The rising cost of post-secondary education, coupled with inadequate entry-level salaries, makes it difficult for youth to repay their student loans. This financial stress not only hampers their academic performance but also affects their overall well-being. Many young individuals question the misalignment between the high costs of education and the promise of well-paying jobs.\n\nEquity:\nThere is a concerning disparity, particularly among unemployed youth with disabilities, who fear being deemed \"expensive\" by potential employers. Additionally, youth from low-income communities encounter difficulties in establishing robust professional networks, which negatively impacts their job prospects. Furthermore, workplace discrimination perpetuates pay gaps and unequal opportunities.\n\nConclusion:\nYoung individuals confront a wide array of challenges in their pursuit of meaningful employment, and significant inequities persist across different groups. Governments must provide continuous support to help youth secure entry-level jobs that offer opportunities for growth and career development.

Within each theme, both positive and negative aspects are explored, leading to recommendations for providing youth with better resources and stable learning environments. Access to technology and online educational settings are crucial for young people, offering advantages such as eliminating the need to constantly relocate for socializing or accessing services, which saves energy and resources. However, challenges such as internet speed and service costs can hamper work, particularly in rural and remote communities. Working from home also presents obstacles related to technology access and home environments. On a positive note, it can foster a sense of autonomy and reduce social anxiety.\n\nEducation:\n\nEducation plays a significant role in the lives of Canadian youth, with post-secondary education providing access to better future income. However, education is expensive, and many young individuals still feel unprepared for the workforce upon leaving school. Youth seek unique opportunities to explore their individuality and apply their interests and skillsets. Students who actively engage in community development initiatives and entrepreneurial pursuits often face difficulties in graduating within four years or completing their education altogether. Students with disabilities also tend to graduate later than their peers. Access to French-language schools in official-language minority communities poses challenges, leading to disparities between French and English programs. Initiatives like mitacsfootnote29 create pathways for post-secondary students to explore entrepreneurship and innovation, but their impact is limited due to scope. Undergraduate students from underrepresented communities desire similar opportunities to gain hands-on experiences in entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nEquity:\n\nEquitable access to quality education depends on location and wealth. Indigenous youth, in particular, face low rates of post-secondary education completion due to barriers such as relevant ways of learning and knowing, transportation, and support systems. Youth aspire to provide solutions to the societal problems we face and wish to be part of leading the change. Youth-led organizations should be recognized as an asset rather than a liability, offering valuable contributions to achieving equity and participating in the necessary structural changes. Covid-19 has made education more accessible in certain ways but has also presented learning difficulties.\n\nMental Health:\n\nCovid-19 and the shift to virtual learning have significantly impacted mental health. Heavier workloads and the inability to prioritize the acquisition of necessary skills for virtual learning have increased stress levels. Limited social interactions have made it harder to build relationships and make friends. Some youth have been isolated in toxic family environments after leaving school. However, the pandemic has also taught individuals valuable lessons in time management and self-discipline. Schools should prioritize mental health as many youth feel intense pressure to succeed and select the \"right\" courses. Some youth report feeling compelled to pursue post-secondary education despite lacking genuine interest. Mental health issues can hinder the development of necessary learning outcomes for youth advancement."}]}

Until this speech is delivered by the head of state or their representative, the Senate and the House of Commons are unable to conduct public business. Traditionally, the Governor General reads the speech as the Queen's representative in Canada, although in 1957 and 1977, the Queen herself chose to deliver the speech. This ceremony takes place in the Senate chamber, where the Governor General reads the speech from the seat reserved for the Queen or her representative, hence the name \"Speech from the Throne\". Members of the House of Commons, Senators, Supreme Court justices, and other invited guests attend the reading.\n\nThe Governor General plays two crucial roles in the opening of a new session of parliament. First, upon the advice of the Prime Minister, the Governor General summons parliament through a proclamation. Only after the Governor General issues this proclamation do the Senate and the House of Commons have the authority to commence the session. Additionally, the Governor General reads the speech, which is prepared by the government. They have the option to include an introduction that outlines their own activities.\n\nThe Usher of the Black Rod, a senior parliamentary officer, plays a significant role in the Senate chamber. Appointed by the Governor General based on the Prime Minister's recommendation, the Usher of the Black Rod has various ceremonial and security-related responsibilities in support of the Senate. One of their tasks includes facilitating the delivery of the Speech from the Throne, which takes place in the Senate chamber. Prior to the Governor General's reading, the Usher of the Black Rod leaves the Senate chamber and knocks three times on the doors of the House of Commons with the black rod. This serves as a signal for Members of Parliament to proceed to the Senate chamber. The position of the Usher of the Black Rod traces its roots back approximately 600 years in England. In Canada, the original title was \"Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod\" until 1997 when Mary C. McLaren became the first woman to hold the position. Since then, the title has been gender-neutral.\n\nFollowing the Governor General's delivery of the Speech from the Throne, the new session of parliament officially commences, allowing public business to commence in both the Senate and the House of Commons. The first order of business is for the Prime Minister to introduce Bill C-1 in the House of Commons, while a senator introduces a similar bill, Bill S-1, in the Senate. These bills illustrate the independence of the House of Commons and the Senate from the Crown, affirming their right to convene and deliberate without being bound by the agenda outlined in the Speech from the Throne. The bills undergo the first reading but not the second. Following the first reading, both the House of Commons and the Senate engage in debates on the Speech from the Throne."}]}

Firstly, digital debt is impeding innovation, as employees spend a significant amount of time managing data overload instead of engaging in creative work. When 62% of employees report spending excessive time on information retrieval, communication, and coordination, it leaves little room for deep thinking, creativity, and collaboration. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of employees feel they lack sufficient time and energy to fulfill their job responsibilities, leading to a 3.5 times higher likelihood of struggling with innovation and strategic thinking."}]}

With NASA's remarkable progress towards its first lunar missions in over half a century, a fresh generation of Americans can now witness the astonishing power and joy of a moon landing. Moreover, this achievement has the potential to inspire individuals from diverse backgrounds and age groups to pursue careers in space-related STEM fields, encompassing astronauts, engineers, physicists, and technicians.\n\nIn recent years, we have witnessed significant milestones in space exploration that promote diversity. Notable examples include the first all-female spacewalk and NASA's diverse international crew of astronauts for the Artemis II lunar mission, where the first woman and person of color will set foot on the moon. While these accomplishments signify a pivotal shift in the industry, it is important to note that women still comprise only 20% of the space workforce, and black and Hispanic professionals remain underrepresented in STEM professions. In fact, underrepresented minority groups account for only 24% of the entire STEM workforce. These statistics underscore the pressing need to expand access to STEM education and the study of space, which forms a core aspect of the Microsoft-NASA partnership. Together, we aim to address these inequities head-on.\n\nMicrosoft and NASA's partnership, which spans over two decades, plays a crucial role in investing in the next generation by promoting STEM education across all communities. As part of this collaborative effort, we are delighted to announce our inaugural Space Education Day, a special event taking place at Microsoft's office in Arlington, Virginia, on Tuesday, June 20. This event will serve as a platform for local students to connect with Microsoft and NASA members, engaging in a day of innovative learning and technology demonstrations. We are thrilled to welcome students from the greater Washington, D.C. region, a diverse population ranging from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade.\n\nDuring Space Education Day, students will have the opportunity to participate in live demonstrations featuring the Minecraft Education Portal. This immersive learning platform, inspired by NASA's Artemis missions, enables students to learn programming and exercise their skills in real-time. Microsoft's Minecraft Education recently partnered with NASA and the Challenge Center to equip students with future-ready skills for the next era of space exploration.\n\nMike Kincaid, Associate Administrator for NASA's Office of STEM Engagement, emphasizes the importance of investing in students from all backgrounds, noting that doing so will build a diverse workforce capable of achieving groundbreaking advancements in space. Space Education Day will feature various sessions, including Microsoft Space Camps, where Minecraft Artemis students can explore the lunar surface and learn about NASA's Artemis program in an engaging Minecraft environment. Additionally, college students will showcase their experience and technology in the Azure Space Hackathon, utilizing NASA satellite imagery, Microsoft's AI capabilities, and the Planetary Computer to locate offshore wind farms worldwide. Furthermore, partners will discuss the goals and objectives of the NASA Space Accelerator program, connecting minority-serving institutions to mentorship and funding opportunities from NASA and Microsoft.\n\nSpace Education Day is a testament to the ongoing efforts of Microsoft and NASA to develop impactful initiatives and educational resources that promote STEM education for all. Last May, Azure Space and NASA hosted a student hackathon titled \"Coding for the Cosmos,\" bringing together students from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in Washington, D.C. This event fostered the development of new technologies, including the deployment of code to the International Space Station. By harnessing the power of technology and space, we can inspire, prepare, and engage individuals of diverse backgrounds and ages. Microsoft remains committed to seeking new opportunities that encourage everyone to reach for the stars."}]}

WNV is an infection that spreads through mosquito bites. Although the current risk of infection in Toronto is low, TPH strongly advises residents to take necessary precautions to avoid mosquito bites, particularly leading up to the August long weekend. These precautions include wearing light-colored clothing, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors, as well as applying insect repellent containing N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) or icaridin, following the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, it is important to be extra vigilant during peak mosquito-biting hours, which are dusk and dawn, by using repellent and covering up. Ensuring that homes have tight-fitting screens on windows and doors is also recommended. Furthermore, residents should remove any standing water from their properties, as it serves as a breeding ground for mosquitos. Standing water includes water collected in items like pool covers, buckets, planters, toys, and garbage/recycling containers.\n\nSymptoms of WNV typically appear between two and 14 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. These symptoms may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, body aches, skin rash, and swollen lymph glands. Older individuals or those with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk of severe illness. If anyone experiences any concerning symptoms, it is advisable to contact a healthcare provider.\n\nTPH conducts mosquito surveillance and monitoring from mid-June to mid-September each year. As part of this surveillance, 22 mosquito traps are set across Toronto once a week to collect mosquitos, which are then sent to a laboratory for identification and testing for WNV in batches. Thus far in 2023, 20 batches (or pools) of mosquitos have tested positive for WNV. With the recent increase in hot weather in Toronto, there is a heightened risk of mosquitos transmitting the virus once they become infected. In 2022, a total of 14 batches of mosquitos were confirmed to be positive for the virus, in addition to 14 laboratory-confirmed human cases of WNV.\n\nFor more information and ways to reduce the risk of WNV infection, please visit the City's West Nile Virus webpage. Dr. Eileen de Villa, Medical Officer of Health, emphasizes the importance of reminding residents about preventive measures ahead of the long weekend: \"While the risk of being infected with West Nile Virus remains low in Toronto, now is a good time to remind residents ahead of the long weekend of the steps they can take to avoid bites from infected mosquitos when enjoying the beautiful summer weather. Apply insect repellent, wear light-colored clothing, long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and take extra care between dusk and dawn, which are peak mosquito-biting hours.\"\n\nToronto is a vibrant city with a population of over three million people. Its diversity and experiences have made it Canada's leading economic engine and one of the most diverse and livable cities in the world. As the fourth largest city in North America, Toronto is a global leader in technology, finance, film, music, culture, innovation, and climate action. This position is attributed to the investments supported by its government, residents, and businesses.

The pilot will be in effect until Monday, October 9th. Councillor Shelley Carroll, Chair of the Economic and Community Development Committee, along with city staff, introduced the two-month pilot program at Earlscourt Park this morning. Comprehensive information about the program, including park locations, regulations, and restrictions, can be found on the city's Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage. In July, Toronto City Council approved the program after consulting with local councillors and selecting the parks. The council's decision is available on the city's website. This pilot program is based on public health guidance, public safety considerations, operational factors, and the experiences of other Canadian cities. Park users are expected to comply with all relevant bylaws and legislation, including the provincial Liquor License and Control Act of 2019, which prohibits public intoxication and serving alcohol to individuals under 19 years old. Alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited in non-pilot parks. A permit and license are still required for selling or serving liquor in any park. Additionally, alcohol consumption is not allowed within the boundaries of outdoor swimming pools or decks, and within two meters of playgrounds, wading pools, splash pads, or skateboard parks in pilot program locations. The city of Toronto is the first Ontario municipality to implement such a pilot program since the province authorized municipalities to designate public spaces for personal alcohol consumption. Other Canadian jurisdictions, including Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton, have successfully implemented similar programs. The city will assess the impact of the pilot through 311 reporting, on-site observations, and an online public survey. Residents and visitors are encouraged to participate in the survey, available on the city's Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage. The findings will be reported to the council in early 2024. Throughout the pilot, bylaw enforcement officers will educate park visitors about the rules and city bylaws. They will continue to visit parks across Toronto to ensure compliance. The city will promptly address park complaints and prioritize investigations into matters that pose risks to public use and nuisance control. Collaboration with Toronto Public Health will continue to provide information about safe alcohol consumption. For information on health risks associated with alcohol and safer drinking tips, please visit the city's Alcohol & Other Drugs webpage. Councillor Shelley Carroll, Chair of the Infrastructure and Environment Committee, expressed enthusiasm for the pilot program, stating, \"We're glad to launch this sensible pilot and give residents the opportunity to drink responsibly in select public spaces. The city's Alcohol in Parks Pilot webpage provides all the details about the program, including the full list of participating parks, program guidelines, and tips for safe drinking and harm reduction. This pilot will run until October 9th, and I encourage everyone to share their feedback through the online survey, which is now open.\" Toronto, with its diverse population and experiences, is home to more than three million people.

Effective immediately, the program will prioritize individuals between the ages of 20 and 64 who are living in deep poverty, including low-wage and part-time workers, newcomers, and unemployed individuals receiving employment assistance. It will also extend to residents on the waitlist for subsidized housing and child care, offering immediate financial relief for their transportation costs.\n\nThe Fair Pass Program grants a 12-month discount on TTC travel, including Wheel-Trans. Currently, it provides a 36% discount on single adult fares (reducing the fare to $2.10) and a 21% discount on monthly passes (bringing the cost down to $123.25 for adults), achieved by adding a discount code to the rider's Presto card. This expansion marks the start of the program's third phase, allowing any Toronto resident who meets the age and income criteria to benefit from the discount.\n\nTo be eligible for the Fair Pass Program, individuals must have an after-tax income below $20,514, while a family of four must have an income below $41,028. The income threshold for the program has been temporarily reduced to 75% of the Low-Income Measure After-Tax (LIM-AT), with the intention of returning to the original LIM-AT plus 15% threshold as soon as possible. Applicants who receive assistance through Ontario Works (OW), the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), or a Toronto child care fee subsidy can continue to provide their program identification number when applying. Other applicants must submit income documents to determine their financial eligibility.\n\nResidents can apply for the Fair Pass Program online or by calling 416-338-8888. To assist residents in obtaining a Presto card during the application process, the city has partnered with the Toronto Public Library's (TPL) Complimentary Presto Card Initiative, which distributes free Presto cards at participating TPL branches on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nThe Fair Pass Program is a pivotal component of Toronto's Poverty Reduction Strategy, which was first approved by the Toronto City Council in 2016 to make transit more affordable for low-income adult residents. For more information on the city's poverty reduction efforts, please visit our website.\n\nThis marks the third expansion of the Fair Pass Program, which was designed to be phased and adaptable. In 2018, the program initially included OW and ODSP recipients. In 2019, eligibility expanded to include recipients of Toronto Children's Services' child care fee subsidy, and in 2022, it expanded further to include recipients of rent-geared-to-income (RGI) subsidies.\n\nThe Fair Pass Transit Discount Program offers a targeted discount on TTC fares to low-income working-age adults in Toronto. Recognizing that low-income residents rely heavily on public transit to access vital services, education, employment, social and health services, and opportunities outside their immediate communities, the program aims to remove financial barriers.\n\nBy providing a transit discount, the Fair Pass Program helps ease the daily financial burdens faced by low-income residents.

This collaborative approach ensured comprehensive social and health service supports were provided directly at the park, reducing barriers and promoting client self-determination. Through this model, 90 individuals at Dufferin Grove Park achieved successful outcomes, including referrals to shelter programs, transitions to permanent housing, and family reunification. Additionally, 101 tents or structures were removed, as all encampment occupants either left the park voluntarily or achieved successful outcomes.\n\nThe city is incorporating the learnings from the Dufferin Grove report into its approach, utilizing best practices beyond the park initiative. These learnings are crucial in informing the city's ongoing response to larger encampments and effectively meeting the needs of individuals within them. The report's identified best practices are being utilized by the city's Streets to Homes and Encampment Office to support outreach efforts at other encampments. They are also informing the development and update of the city's interdepartmental service protocol for homeless individuals camping in public spaces.\n\nThe demand for shelter in Toronto has reached unprecedented levels since 2016, with a 125% increase in the number of shelter spaces needed daily, now totaling approximately 9,000. Despite adding over 1,000 shelter spaces in the past year, the system remains consistently at capacity. In 2023, outreach staff and community partners successfully referred 352 individuals from encampments to the shelter system, with 57 people securing housing tenancies.\n\nTo replicate the successful approach used at Dufferin Grove Park in other locations, the following factors must be present: dedicated housing and shelter options, dedicated staff from various city divisions, local community partners, resident groups, and volunteers, onsite community supports to provide critical services, and a park with sufficient size and suitable location to accommodate an intensive level of resources.\n\nThe City of Toronto remains committed to addressing homelessness and encampments, continuously seeking innovative solutions and working collaboratively with various stakeholders to ensure the provision of adequate housing and support services."}]}

By leveraging the expertise, resources, relationships, and authorities of various city divisions and community partners, we aim to ensure the well-being of individuals in and around encampments. Our efforts focus on facilitating access to safer indoor spaces, removing waste and debris, and ensuring that shared-use spaces are accessible for everyone.\n\nToronto boasts a system of over 1,500 parks and ravines that serve as recreational areas for the community. Our outreach initiatives at these locations specifically target individuals residing in encampments and other outdoor areas. Through building trusting relationships, we strive to address immediate health and safety needs and assist in finding permanent housing. Our dedicated outreach staff visit different sites on a daily basis to work closely with encampment occupants, facilitating referrals to the shelter system and connecting them with housing workers. This engagement process continues even after individuals accept indoor accommodations to provide ongoing support and access to services.\n\nIn addition, our Streets to Homes outreach team, in collaboration with partner agencies, conducts daily outreach activities to proactively connect with individuals living on the streets. Operating 24/7, year-round, their primary focus is establishing supportive relationships as a first step towards addressing immediate health and safety concerns. They also provide support in finding and transitioning into shelter and housing. In 2022, Streets to Homes received approximately 1,277 referrals for indoor space, with 1,112 of these referrals originating from encampments.\n\nWhile the city cannot compel individuals to utilize the services offered in shelters, we remain committed to encouraging them to take advantage of shelter and housing options. All members of the community are welcome to utilize the city's parks and right-of-ways, as long as they comply with city bylaws. However, it is important to note that living in an encampment is in violation of the city parks bylaw and streets and sidewalks bylaw. Trespass enforcement decisions are only made after exhaustive outreach and engagement efforts, including unsuccessful referrals to indoor spaces.\n\nThe city is dedicated to making homelessness rare, brief, and non-recurring, but we cannot achieve this goal alone. Urgent investments from the government of Canada and the province of Ontario are needed to complement our efforts. These investments should prioritize the increase in the supply of deeply affordable rental housing with necessary supports, such as harm reduction and mental health services. Additionally, investments in homelessness prevention programs and poverty reduction measures are essential to prevent more households from experiencing homelessness. To enhance preventative measures, the city has allocated an additional $1 million to its EPIC program (Eviction Prevention in Community), but further investment from our government partners is required.\n\nAll Toronto shelters adhere to the housing first approach, which recognizes stable housing as the primary need for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. In the past year alone, we have successfully assisted over 4,300 individuals in transitioning from the shelter system to permanent housing. Our shelter system has expanded significantly, with approximately 9,000 beds offered across more than 100 locations in the city, compared to 4,000 spaces in 2016. We have collaborated with government partners to construct supportive housing, aiding thousands of individuals in moving from shelters to permanent housing. This year, an additional 1,200 supportive housing opportunities will become available for those experiencing homelessness.\n\nSince 2014, the city's investment in housing has increased by 124%, and our 2023 budget allocates $618 million in direct support for housing initiatives, representing a $341.9 million increase.\n\nTogether, with the support and partnership of various stakeholders, we are committed to addressing homelessness effectively and creating a better future for all Torontonians."}]}

These sites were carefully chosen in collaboration with indigenous community members and leaders, who expressed a need for such spaces in these areas. We are also planning additional sites in the future.\n\nFor generations, indigenous peoples have relied on sacred fires for wellness, healing, and community gatherings. Just as some individuals gather in places of worship, these ceremonies take place on the land. Fire is seen as a sacred gift from the Creator, serving as a channel of communication with the spirit world, ancestors, and creation. It holds immense significance in various ceremonies.\n\nThe creation of these designated sacred fire sites is a testament to our ongoing efforts to provide indigenous community members with greater access to land for their ceremonies. In 2021, Toronto City Council approved city by-law amendments that introduced a new fee classification for cultural fires, including sacred fires. This decision was made in consultation with Toronto Fire Services (TFS), the Indigenous Affairs Office (IAO), and indigenous communities. By establishing a category for open-air burnings related to cultural or religious practices, TFS can ensure fire safety while honoring the importance of indigenous sacred fires and respecting the cultural and religious rights of other equity-seeking communities.\n\nThe designated sacred fire sites will be inspected by TFS once a year to ensure their safety, as mandated by the Ontario Fire Code. However, indigenous community members can still hold sacred fires at undesignated sites by contacting the IAO or TFS, as they will arrange for staff to conduct safety inspections.\n\nEach location has an indigenous site facilitator from the community who has served as an advisory circle in the development of these sacred fire sites. They have worked closely with city staff to select the locations, determine necessary materials on-site, and raise awareness of these sites within their communities. These site facilitators will be available to support community members as they begin utilizing the sites and will continue to serve as a circle to foster ongoing engagement and improvement of the sacred fire process.\n\nOut of respect for the spiritual nature of sacred fires, it is essential to obtain permission from the elder or firekeeper before filming or photographing any aspect of a ceremony. Additionally, if showcasing footage of a sacred fire ceremony, it is good practice to acknowledge that permission was granted by the elder and/or firekeeper to capture and exhibit the footage.\n\nThe creation of designated sacred fire sites in city parks aligns with Action 15 of the city\u2019s reconciliation action plan, which aims to remove barriers for indigenous individuals in accessing sacred fires. Furthermore, these sites are supported by articles in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the calls to action outlined in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s final report.\n\nToronto is home to over 2.9 million diverse individuals, making it Canada\u2019s leading economic hub and one of the most livable and culturally vibrant cities globally. As the fourth largest city in North America, Toronto excels in technology, finance, film, music, culture, and innovation. These achievements are a result of the collaborative efforts between the government, residents, and businesses, who continuously invest in the city's growth and development."}]}

Over the past three years, Apple has more than doubled its initial financial commitment, totaling over $200 million. Since its launch in June 2020, REJI has focused on supporting education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform work in the United States, and has recently expanded to Australia, the UK, and Mexico.\n\nREJI was launched by Apple at a crucial moment in the United States, amidst widespread protests against racial injustice. This initiative builds upon Apple's existing efforts to create equal access to opportunity and advance equity for underserved groups. It has established a dedicated entity to accelerate progress through extensive engagement with schools and communities.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook expressed the company's commitment to building a more just and equitable world, highlighting the importance of collaboration and a shared sense of purpose. Apple is proud to partner with numerous organizations dedicated to addressing injustice and removing barriers to opportunity. The company will continue to lead with its values as it expands its efforts to create opportunities, uplift communities, and build a better future for all.\n\nThrough REJI's education grants, Apple has already reached over 160,000 learners through in-person courses and out-of-school offerings. Additionally, over $50 million has been committed to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) to support science, technology, engineering, arts, and math opportunities. In the realm of economic empowerment, REJI funds financial institutions that support Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous entrepreneurs and businesses, including venture capital firms, community development financial institutions, and minority depository institutions.

Alongside these updates, Apple has introduced new features, such as Check In, Namedrop, and Live Voicemail, which prioritize privacy and security.\n\nThese efforts reflect Apple's unwavering belief that privacy is a fundamental human right and that strong security is the foundation for good privacy. Craig Federighi, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, emphasized that privacy is integrated into every Apple product and feature right from the start. Apple remains committed to empowering users to have control over their data and consistently providing industry-leading privacy features and top-notch data security.\n\nIn the realm of Safari private browsing, Apple has made significant enhancements to offer users even greater protection against trackers and unauthorized access to their devices. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections have been implemented to prevent websites from utilizing the latest techniques to track or identify users. Additionally, private browsing now automatically locks when not in use, ensuring that users can keep their tabs open even when they step away from their device.\n\nApple has also made improvements to the privacy permissions for photos. A new embedded photos picker allows users to share specific photos with apps while safeguarding the privacy of the rest of their photo library. When apps request access to the entire photo library, users will receive more information about what they are sharing, accompanied by occasional reminders of their choices.\n\nFurthermore, Apple has taken steps to enhance link tracking protection in Messages, Mail, and Safari private browsing. Often, websites add extra information to their URLs to track users across different sites. Apple has now eliminated this information from links shared in messages, mail, and Safari's private browsing mode. The links will still function as expected, providing users with improved privacy.\n\nApple's app privacy improvements equip developers with more comprehensive information about the data practices of third-party software development kits (SDKs) used in their apps. This enables them to provide more accurate privacy nutrition labels. Additionally, these changes enhance the integrity of the software supply chain by supporting signatures for third-party SDKs, adding an extra layer of protection against misuse.\n\nApple's commitment to user safety is evident in the introduction of communication safety features. Communication safety now includes the ability to warn children about receiving or sending photos and videos containing nudity in messages. Developers can integrate this feature directly into their apps using a new API. Communication safety also extends its protection to airdrops, FaceTime video messages, and the phone app when receiving a contact poster and using the photos picker to choose content. All image and video processing for communication safety occurs on the device, ensuring that neither Apple nor any third party gains access to the content. These warnings are automatically enabled for child accounts in the family sharing plan and can be disabled by parents.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has introduced the sensitive content warning feature to help adult users avoid unwanted exposure to nude images and videos in various contexts, including messages, airdrops, FaceTime video messages, and the phone app. This feature operates using the same privacy-preserving technology as communication safety. The sensitive content warning is optional and can be enabled by users in the privacy and security settings. As with communication safety, all image and video processing for the sensitive content warning occurs on the device, with no access granted to Apple or any third party.\n\nIn summary, Apple's latest privacy and security innovations, including enhancements to Safari private browsing, communication safety, and lockdown mode, as well as improvements in app privacy, demonstrate the company's commitment to upholding privacy as a fundamental human right. With features like Check In, Namedrop, and Live Voicemail, Apple continues to prioritize the development of tools that prioritize privacy and security at their core. These advancements align with Apple's dedication to putting users in control of their data and providing industry-leading privacy features and top-tier data security."}]}

Since our establishment in 1998, we have operated our business with a strong commitment to environmental and social responsibility. In fact, we have been carbon neutral since 2007 and for the past three years, we have matched our entire electricity consumption with renewable sources. Additionally, we have made significant investments in affordable housing and have taken substantial steps to promote racial equity.\n\nToday, as part of a $10 billion debt offering, we are thrilled to announce that we have issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds. This marks the largest sustainability or green bond ever issued by any company. While many companies have issued green bonds solely for environmental purposes, our sustainability bonds are unique as they support both environmental and social initiatives. This emerging asset class has the potential to make a significant impact, and we hope this transaction will contribute to the development of this new market.\n\nWe are delighted to share that the demand for these sustainability bonds from investors has far exceeded our expectations. They were significantly oversubscribed, reflecting the strong interest in supporting initiatives that prioritize environmental and social responsibility. The proceeds from these bonds will fund ongoing and new projects that align with our commitment to sustainability, enabling investors to join us in addressing critical issues.\n\nWe firmly believe that these investments not only benefit our communities, employees, and stakeholders but are also integral to fulfilling Google's mission of creating long-term value. In line with the green bond principles and the social bond principles, the proceeds from these bonds will be allocated to projects falling within eight key areas. These areas build on our previous significant investments and will not be allocated to any Google.org activities.\n\nFor more than a decade, we have consistently worked towards making our data centers some of the most energy-efficient in the world. Through optimizing our use of energy, water, and materials, our data centers are now twice as efficient as typical enterprise data centers. In comparison to five years ago, we now deliver approximately seven times more computing power with the same amount of electricity. This commitment to efficiency and sustainability is crucial in combating climate change.\n\nTo further our efforts in transitioning to a clean energy economy, we have already committed around $4 billion to purchasing clean energy from over 50 wind and solar projects globally until 2034. Our focus now lies in achieving our long-term vision of sourcing carbon-free energy for our operations 24/7. This entails matching our energy consumption with clean energy for each of our data centers worldwide on an hour-by-hour basis.\n\nSince our inception, we have prioritized the impact of our workplaces, from sustainable office construction to reducing food waste in our cafes. We are proud to share that over 13 million square feet of Google offices are LEED certified. Additionally, we actively promote the use of electric vehicles and bicycles to mitigate carbon emissions and reduce traffic. By utilizing Google shuttles in the Bay Area, we have already saved over 40,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions, equivalent to taking 8,760 cars off the road every work day.\n\nOur commitment to maximizing the reuse of finite resources extends across our operations, products, and supply chains. To date, we have shipped millions of devices made with post-consumer recycled plastic. Furthermore, all Nest products launched in 2019 include recycled plastics.\n\nLastly, we strive to be a positive presence in the communities we call home. To address the lack of affordable housing in the Bay Area, we have pledged $1 billion towards housing investments, with a goal of helping to build 20,000 residential units, at least 5,000 of which will be affordable. Moreover, in response to the devastating impact of COVID-19, we have committed over $800 million to support small- and medium-sized businesses, health organizations, governments, and frontline health workers. Partnering with the Opportunity Finance Network, we are providing low-interest loans to community development financial institutions, which in turn offer loans to small businesses in underserved communities in the U.S. Additionally, we are collaborating with the American Library Association to establish entrepreneurship centers across the country."}]}

It serves as the primary distribution channel for critical investigative work that exposes wrongdoing and brings about change. Unfortunately, there are individuals who seek to stifle journalism, particularly when it is most needed. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is simple and inexpensive to carry out, can render a website completely offline without the owners even realizing they have been targeted. These attacks pose a threat to freedom of expression and access to information, both of which are fundamental values for Google.\n\nTo address this issue, we developed Project Shield, leveraging Google's robust security infrastructure to detect and filter attacks on news and human rights websites. After successful testing with a select group, we are now expanding Project Shield to all news sites worldwide, aiming to protect them from DDoS attacks and eliminate this form of censorship. Through our early testing, we not only managed to keep websites online during attacks that would have otherwise taken them down, but we also gained valuable insights into attack patterns and improved our defense mechanisms.\n\nBy opening up access to Project Shield for tens of thousands of news sites, even the smallest independent organizations can continue their vital work without the fear of being silenced. It is worth noting that Project Shield extends beyond safeguarding journalism alone; it also contributes to the overall health of the internet by mitigating a significant threat faced by publishers and those who wish to share content that may be deemed inconvenient by some. Our commitment to a free and open internet relies on protecting the unimpeded flow of information, beginning with news outlets.\n\nTo understand how Project Shield operates and discover how you can join the efforts to safeguard our world's news, please visit our website. We invite individuals working in journalism to join us in this fight to protect the integrity of news and uphold the principles of a free society."}]}

We have witnessed Canadian creators from various fields, including educators, comedians, and Minecraft gamers, utilize YouTube to establish successful digital businesses and contribute to the enrichment of Canada's culture. \n\nToday, Oxford Economics released a report evaluating the economic, societal, and cultural contributions of YouTube in Canada in 2022. The report reveals that YouTube's creative ecosystem has contributed over $2.0 billion CAD to Canada's GDP in 2022 and has supported more than 35,000 full-time equivalent jobs. \n\nCassandra is one of the many Canadian creators who have leveraged the power of YouTube to build a thriving community and business through her channel, Clutterbug, which has 780k subscribers and over 94 million views. As a mother of three, Cassandra struggled with maintaining an organized home. However, after discovering effective home management methods, she was determined to share her organization tips and tricks. With a camera gifted by her husband, Cassandra uploaded her first YouTube video a decade ago, hoping to explore business opportunities and connect with potential customers. Now, Cassandra has authored four best-selling books, hosts a podcast, and even has an HGTV show called \"Hot Mess House.\" Her favorite aspect of being a creator is the interactive experience she shares with her community. She constantly receives feedback from viewers about how her cleaning philosophy has improved their homes, lives, and even relationships. \n\nIn addition to economic impact, Canadian creators also play a vital role in shaping society and providing educational resources. Steph & Den noticed a lack of creators in the personal finance education space who addressed their daily financial decision-making from a relatable perspective. This motivated them to start their own channel, which has garnered 89k subscribers and over 17 million views. Through their content, they delve into topics such as investing, managing debt, and understanding money systems, aiming to demystify finance for their community on YouTube. \n\nOne in three creators in Canada who earn money from YouTube consider it their primary source of revenue. These creators not only contribute to expanding people's perspectives on various subjects but also allow individuals from diverse backgrounds to share their culture worldwide. Bilal, for example, started posting content on his YouTube channel, GoldenGully, with over 4.06 million subscribers and 3 billion views, to showcase his family recipes and love for Pakistani food and flavors. As his channel grew, Bilal found that his content resonated with viewers from Canada, Germany, Iran, and Mexico, who shared stories in the comments about the similarities between Pakistani cuisine and their own family recipes. Bilal credits YouTube's global platform for enabling him to share his passion with the world. \n\nThe Oxford Economics report reaffirms what we are observing throughout Canada - that Canadian creators are incredibly successful. These creators represent both the current and future generation of CEOs, directors, writers, producers, editors, marketers, and talented individuals. They continue to thrive on YouTube, shape culture, and make a positive impact in Canada.

In Canada, local creators have managed to captivate both Canadian and global audiences, surpassing expectations. Recent research from Oxford Economics reveals that YouTube's creative ecosystem contributed a staggering $2.0 billion CAD to Canada's GDP in 2022 and supported 35,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Despite the abundance of content options available to Canadians, they consistently choose to spend their time on YouTube, engaging with the creators and content they love. In fact, YouTube boasts a large and dedicated audience, making it the go-to platform for creators, viewers, and advertisers alike. According to Comscore, YouTube reaches a remarkable 98% of Canadians across all demographics, solidifying its position as the number one ad-supported video platform in Canada. Furthermore, the rise of connected TV (CTV) has led to an increased number of Canadians streaming YouTube on their TV screens. The living room has become the preferred choice for indulging in YouTube content, with over 17 million people streaming the platform on their TVs in Canada in December 2022. CTv remains the fastest-growing platform for YouTube, as the living room revolution continues to shape consumer behavior. With YouTube on CTV, advertisers can benefit from the impactful nature of TV advertising while enjoying the precision and control offered by digital platforms. YouTube offers the trifecta of reach, relevance, and a highly connected ad ecosystem, allowing advertisers to drive better results and maximize the impact of their media spend. As YouTube's viewership continues to grow, we are committed to simplifying the advertising process and facilitating connections between brands and customers on any screen. Here are some of the ways we are making it easier for advertisers to engage with their target audience: 1. Brands can tap into previously untapped customer segments through solutions like YouTube Select lineups, which feature the most popular content watched on TV from top creators, live sports, shows, and music. 2. We have expanded our renowned YouTube Masthead opportunity to provide additional ways for brands to capture audience attention. For example, we recently introduced the cost-per-hour masthead, enabling brands to exclusively own the masthead during the hour(s) surrounding priority moments, such as new movie releases or product launches. 3. Short-form videos are experiencing significant growth, and YouTube Shorts has emerged as a vibrant platform encompassing a wide range of content categories, including music, gaming, sports, lifestyle, learning, and food. Brands can leverage these short-form videos to drive performance in their direct-response campaigns through features like video action campaigns and app campaigns. These campaigns utilize AI to ensure that brands can easily develop appropriate creative and reach the right audiences. 4. In line with advertiser objectives and the desire for richer storytelling, we are introducing 30-second non-skippable ads to YouTube Select on CTV. This format seamlessly integrates into the viewing experience viewers expect on the big screen, presenting one 30-second ad instead of two consecutive 15-second ads. 5. To enhance the user experience for both viewers and advertisers, we have created an interactive and seamless across-screen experience. Brand extensions enable viewers watching on the big screen to learn more about a product with a single click, without interrupting their viewing experience."}]}

Recognizing that many families spend a significant amount of time on Google platforms and devices, we are committed to investing in protections, privacy features, and user-friendly content controls to ensure a safe online experience for families. Today, we want to remind Canadians about the resources, tips, and safety features available from Google and YouTube that can help them manage their digital experience and develop smarter, safer online habits.\n\nAt YouTube, removing content that violates our community guidelines is a top priority. We utilize a combination of machine learning and human reviewers to quickly identify and take down such content, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails. Our policies are consistently enforced across language, perspectives, and speakers. In our Q4 Community Guidelines Enforcement Report, we disclosed that YouTube removed over 5.6 million videos for violating our guidelines. It is worth noting that more than 94% of these videos were initially flagged by our automated systems, and over 71% were removed before receiving more than 10 views. Our quarterly report is part of our commitment to transparency in keeping our platform and community safe.\n\nHowever, we understand that Canadian families continue to seek advice and support on how to maintain online safety. Below are some tools to help manage your digital experience:\n\n1. YouTube Kids: We developed YouTube Kids to provide a safer environment for children under 13 to explore their interests and curiosity. It offers extensive filters for age-appropriate content, along with parental controls and settings, including bedtime reminders, screen time limits, and autoplay/search customization. Regularly checking and adjusting family settings is recommended.\n\n2. YouTube Supervised Accounts: Our supervised experience on YouTube gives parents and caregivers options and controls to tailor the online experience for their family. This feature is suitable for families with tweens and teens who have their own mobile devices or want their own YouTube accounts. We have expanded support for supervised accounts across various platforms, including gaming consoles, smart TVs, and the YouTube Music app, ensuring consistent content settings across devices in the home.\n\n3. Google Search SafeSearch: Users can enable SafeSearch on Google, which filters out explicit content. In the near future, a new function will automatically blur explicit search results for users aged 18+ and those who are not signed in.\n\n4. Family Link: The Family Link app helps parents instill healthy digital habits in their children. It provides visibility into a child's device usage, allowing parents to monitor screen time, set device bedtime, and apply content restrictions.\n\nProtecting your family's information and data privacy is crucial for online safety. We prioritize helping people stay safe online and design our products with built-in protections. We also invest in global teams and operations to prevent abuse on our platforms. In recent years, cybersecurity threats have significantly increased, particularly targeting individuals and groups at higher risk, such as activists, journalists, election officials, and public figures. To assist those at risk, we have made our strongest security protections easily accessible.

My name is Sabrina Geremia, and I am the Vice President and Head of Google in Canada. Today, I am joined by Jason Kee, a subject matter expert on search, news, and ads. We are here today to answer your questions regarding our approach to bill C-18 and our news product tests. This committee's work is vital, and we have prioritized making ourselves available to provide the information you need.\n\nGoogle has been proudly operating in Canada for over 20 years, with offices in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, and Waterloo, which serves as our Canadian center of engineering excellence. Additionally, we have colleagues working remotely across the country. Throughout our time in Canada, we have consistently invested in Canadian communities, as they are our communities as well.\n\nWe place great importance on collaborating closely with the news industry. Through our programs, products, and partnerships, we are one of the largest financial supporters of journalism worldwide. This support has delivered significant value and funding to news organizations in Canada and around the globe. In the past year alone, we have linked to Canadian news publishers more than 3.6 billion times, free of charge, helping them generate revenue through ads and new subscriptions. This traffic from our links has resulted in an estimated $250 million worth of value for Canadian publishers.\n\nFurthermore, we also compensate news publishers through our Google News Showcase program. In Canada, we have paid agreements in place to support over 150 publications across the country, in both English and French. These agreements play a vital role in sustaining Canadian newsrooms, both large and small, which provide comprehensive general-interest and local news to their respective communities. Our partners include respected organizations such as Le Devoir, CN2i, Torstar, The Globe and Mail, Black Press Media, M\u00e9tro M\u00e9dia, Postmedia, Village Media, and many others.\n\nInnovation is central to the future of news, and through the Google News Initiative, we provide tools, training, and funding to support Canadian news organizations, independent journalists, and journalism students in adapting, innovating, and thriving. In June 2021, we committed to training 5,000 Canadian journalists and journalism students over the next three years, focusing on strengthening digital skills in newsrooms. Last year alone, we trained over 1,500 Canadian journalists from newsrooms of various sizes, including students, independent journalists, and those serving underrepresented communities.\n\nWe share the government's objective of fostering a healthy, innovative, and diverse news ecosystem for the digital age. Throughout the process of bill C-18, we have worked constructively, maintaining transparency while expressing our concerns with the proposed legislation. We have actively sought collaboration with parliamentarians to improve the bill and offered reasonable and balanced solutions.\n\nHowever, we believe that this bill has serious flaws. By placing a monetary value on free links to webpages, bill C-18 establishes a dangerous precedent that threatens the fundamental principles of the open web and the free flow of information. Additionally, it encourages the creation of low-quality, clickbait content over quality journalism.\n\nThe original intent of C-18 was to encourage platforms like Google to voluntarily enter agreements with news publishers to support Canadians' access to news. However, the exemption and eligibility criteria have shifted significantly, to the point where it would require subsidies for media companies that do not produce news or have an online presence, regardless of whether we link to their content. The bill lacks a clearly defined commitment to a code of ethics for eligibility, which poses a risk to journalism standards in Canada. Unreasonable timelines and unfair arbitration provisions have been introduced, ensuring that any reasonable offer from platforms would be rejected, thus creating a framework for bad faith bargaining.\n\nRather than focusing on supporting local journalism, bill C-18 would subsidize large legacy organizations and broadcasters, while harming emerging and innovative organizations that provide quality local news across Canada. It is clear that this bill is no longer about supporting journalism.\n\nUnder bill C-18, platforms would be subjected to potentially unlimited financial liability merely for providing free links to the news that Canadians are searching for. All Canadians should be concerned about the potential negative impacts on how they find and share news online. As the bill has worsened through each step of the process, we have had to consider the potential product changes it may require. It is crucial that any potential product changes be thoroughly tested before implementation."}]}

According to our recent Kantar Think Auto research for 2022, 80% of Canadians rely on online searches during the car buying process to make informed decisions. It's not just about gathering information either \u2013 online purchases of vehicles have seen an incredible 600% increase since the COVID-19 pandemic, with 6% of Canadian shoppers now purchasing vehicles exclusively online.\n\nToday's shoppers expect a seamless and informative experience when searching for their ideal car. It is crucial for auto advertisers to engage with these potential buyers by providing accurate and comprehensive information about their inventory. That's where Vehicle Ads come in.\n\nWe are excited to introduce Vehicle Ads, a new ad format designed to showcase cars available for sale in Canada. Vehicle Ads enable advertisers to efficiently and effectively reach customers in search of a new ride. For example, when someone searches for a 2023 SUV, they will be presented with multiple vehicle options that can be purchased nearby or delivered to their location. These ads include pictures, as well as important inventory details such as make, model, price, mileage, and location.\n\nOnce a user selects a car from the ad, they will be directed to the vehicle description page on your website. From there, they can fill out a lead form or obtain your dealership's contact information. You have the flexibility to choose which specific actions you want to measure, such as leads and store visits, and assign a value to each.\n\nTo get started with Vehicle Ads, you will need to create a vehicle inventory data feed and connect it to Google Merchant Center. This feed should contain all the necessary information about your vehicle inventory, including make, model, price, mileage, and condition. Google will use this data to match shoppers with the most relevant cars as they conduct their searches. Additionally, you can monitor key inventory and ad performance insights.\n\nDuring the beta testing phase, advertisers who incorporated Vehicle Ads into their existing search campaigns experienced an average increase in conversions of 25%. Let's take a closer look at a couple of businesses that have recently embraced Vehicle Ads.\n\nHamel Honda, in collaboration with the 360 Agency and the Google team, aimed to connect with customers at the right time and with the appropriate inventory. By implementing a Vehicle Ads campaign to promote their used inventory in real-time, they witnessed a 27% increase in leads for used vehicles, along with an 18% decrease in cost per acquisition and a 17% increase in conversion rate.\n\nAsbury Automotive Group recognized the growing demand for online car shopping and sought a solution to meet this demand. By creating a vehicle feed, listing their entire inventory with descriptive attributes like make, model, and dealership locations, they were able to utilize Vehicle Ads to promote their used car inventory in search. This resulted in a 35% increase in conversions and a 12% increase in conversion value for Asbury.\n\nIn conclusion, Vehicle Ads offer an exciting opportunity for auto advertisers to connect with car shoppers in a meaningful and effective way. By providing the right information and inventory, businesses can drive conversions and meet the expectations of today's online car buyers."}]}

These events have forced us to confront the deep-seated structural and systemic racism that black people have endured for generations. Within our own organization, we have embarked on a journey to seek answers and understand the experiences of our black leadership advisory group and black employees.\n\nListening to their personal accounts has only reinforced the stark reality that our black communities face. Systemic racism permeates every aspect of their lives, from interactions with law enforcement to access to housing, capital, healthcare, education, and the workplace. As a company, and as individuals who are committed to building helpful products for everyone, Google is dedicated to translating the energy of this moment into lasting and meaningful change.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce a series of concrete commitments that will drive our efforts to create sustainable equity within our black community and make our products and programs more helpful to black users during critical moments. Building sustainable equity and effecting meaningful change must begin within our own company. By strengthening our commitment to racial equity and inclusion, we can develop more helpful products for our users and the world at large.\n\nTo achieve this, we are making several commitments to build sustainable equity within our black community. Firstly, we are determined to enhance black representation at senior levels. By 2025, our goal is to improve leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30 percent. To achieve this, we will advertise senior leadership roles both internally and externally while increasing our investments in cities such as Atlanta, Washington DC, Chicago, and London, where we already have offices. We will adopt a similar approach across regions, tailoring our plans to recruit and hire more underrepresented googlers in communities that foster a sense of belonging and contribute to a higher quality of life.\n\nSecondly, we recognize the need to address representation challenges comprehensively and focus on hiring, retention, and promotion at all levels. To facilitate this, I am establishing a new talent liaison within each product and functional area to mentor and advocate for the progression and retention of googlers from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, I am convening a task force comprised of senior members from the black community at Google. This task force will develop tangible recommendations and proposals for accountability across all areas influencing the black googler experience, including recruitment, hiring, performance management, career progression, and retention. I have requested that the task force present these proposals, complete with measurable goals, within 90 days.\n\nLastly, we are committed to fostering a stronger sense of inclusion and belonging for all googlers, with a particular focus on our black community. Our internal research indicates that feelings of belonging are influenced by various aspects of our work experiences, such as psychological safety within our teams, support from our managers and leaders, fair people processes, and opportunities for growth and development. We are dedicated to implementing more inclusive practices and policies across all these dimensions and being willing to reevaluate and improve them when necessary. As an example, we have recognized the potential for bias in our security practice of googlers monitoring for unauthorized visitors in our offices, known as \"tailgaters.\" Over the past year, our global security and resilience team, in collaboration with a cross-functional working group, conducted extensive research, listened to the experiences of black googlers, and developed and tested new security procedures. These procedures will allow us to maintain the safety and security of the Google community without relying on this type of enforcement. As we prepare to return to the office, we will cease the practice of badge-checking among googlers and rely on our already robust security infrastructure.\n\nWe are excited about the journey ahead and the positive impact we can make as a company. By working together and staying committed to these goals, we can create lasting change within Google and contribute to a more equitable and inclusive society.\n\nThank you for your dedication and support.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"}]}

However, millions of gallons are lost each year due to a common and preventable cause: leaky toilets. That is why we recently co-funded a pilot project aimed at installing water-saving technology in three multi-family buildings in Los Angeles.\n\nThis technology targets common leaks, such as toilets that continue to run water when not in use, which can accumulate over time. The pilot project is expected to save 6.4 million gallons of water per year in the LA watershed, aligning with our commitment to replenish 120% of the water we consume across our offices and data centers by 2030.\n\nThe pilot project was made possible through collaboration with partners from the California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC), a network of over 25 organizations dedicated to improving water security in the state. This collective effort demonstrates the potential for meaningful progress in addressing water challenges.\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power estimates that the average household loses up to 10,000 gallons of water annually to unnoticed leaky toilets. Fortunately, while detecting these leaks may be challenging, fixing them is relatively simple. For our pilot project, CWAC members Pacific Institute and Bonneville Environmental Foundation addressed this issue in three low-income multi-family housing buildings operated by nonprofit organizations. They worked alongside the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and local water utilities.\n\nToilets in these buildings were equipped with small, affordable, and energy-efficient sensors developed by Sensor Industries. These sensors promptly alert building management in real-time when a toilet needs repair. Often, the fix is as simple as readjusting or replacing the toilet flapper. This intervention has resulted in significant savings in water, money, and energy, according to estimates from Pacific Institute.\n\nThe pilot project is estimated to reduce water usage in the buildings by 15% to 25%, resulting in annual savings of 6.4 million gallons of water. This is equivalent to the total water consumption of approximately 40 single-family homes. Moreover, these savings benefit other customers who rely on the same public utility, leading to reduced water demand and improved water reliability and affordability throughout the system.\n\nThe water savings also translate into cost savings on water and wastewater bills, ranging from 15% to 25%. This amounts to tens of thousands of dollars annually. Nonprofit building operators, who are responsible for paying the water bills, can utilize these savings to make necessary improvements to the buildings, ultimately passing the benefits on to the residents.\n\nIn addition to water and cost savings, the project has positive implications for energy consumption. Southern California relies heavily on imported water, which requires significant energy for transportation and treatment. By reducing the demand for this water, the project helps decrease energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions within the water system.\n\nThis approach offers several advantages, as highlighted by Pacific Institute. Residents do not need to take any action as the non-invasive system detects and notifies the building of any problems. Facility managers can quickly identify the likely cause of the leak, facilitating faster repairs. Moreover, nonprofit building operators can focus on more pressing issues and reduce the time spent on leak detection.\n\nOverall, this pilot project showcases the potential for collective action models to address rising water challenges effectively. It demonstrates how simple interventions, combined with collaboration between different stakeholders, can lead to substantial savings in water, money, and energy."}]}

However, it can also come with a long list of tasks leading up to the first day. Teachers are responsible for creating a positive learning environment, stocking their classrooms, and preparing lessons. At the same time, institutions and procurement teams face the challenge of managing budgets and approving purchases for faculty and staff. There is a lot that goes into ensuring a smooth first day for students.\n\nAmazon Business understands the complexities of the education sector and aims to simplify the buying process for both educators and administrators. We proudly serve 80% of the 100 largest education organizations in the U.S. Our goal is to provide unique savings opportunities and software solutions tailored to your needs.\n\nHere is how you can drive value, improve buyer compliance, and ensure educators get what they need just in time for the new school year:\n\n1. Empower educators: With an Amazon Business account, administrators can define different buying policies. This allows you to identify preferred products or sellers, support local businesses, prioritize buying from minority-owned entities, and promote sustainability initiatives. Administrators can also block restricted sellers or categories and set spending limits for teachers, faculty, and staff using buying policies and approvals. These policies streamline the purchasing process and save time for both procurement teams and buyers.\n\n2. Budget management: School funding is often allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis, which leads to educators frontloading requests at the beginning of the school year out of fear of losing funds. With Amazon Business' budget management tool, administrators can allocate time-bound funds to educators, helping them keep track of their balance and spend it effectively.\n\n3. Building a positive learning environment: A successful classroom relies on creating a positive learning environment where all students can thrive. Educators can start buying materials for specific lesson plans early on, or at the very least, restock basic supplies that will be needed on a daily basis. To make purchasing from Amazon Business even more convenient, we have created a dedicated back-to-school storefront offering educator pricing on a wide range of products. Explore our comprehensive selection of supplies categorized by age group and discover popular products bought by other educators.\n\n4. Quantity discounts and custom quotes: Educators can take advantage of quantity discounts when they purchase two or more of the same item. Additionally, for high-volume purchases over $10,000 or 999 units, buyers can use the custom quote feature to request a discounted price. This allows for greater savings and flexibility when buying in larger quantities.\n\n5. Business lists for streamlined buying: To keep your classroom stocked year-round, we recommend using business lists. Educators can create catalogs of their frequently purchased items, such as paper, pens, post-it notes, and dry-erase markers.

It is the dedication and daily contributions of our team members that make Spotify an exceptional place to work. To foster a sense of unity and appreciation, we prioritize creating opportunities for everyone to come together, connect, and celebrate. Our focus is on cultivating an atmosphere where our audience can freely immerse themselves in the experience we have crafted. Additionally, we strive to foster connections and a sense of community, creating memorable moments that leave a lasting impact. \n\nThis year, we have an additional achievement to commemorate. At our flagship event in Stockholm, we made a conscious effort to prioritize sustainability. We are delighted to announce that we have received the Greentime Sustainable Event Certification. Visibly demonstrating our commitment to sustainability in our employer branding is a powerful way to align our employees' personal values with our company's cultural values. It reassures them that they have joined a company that upholds its responsibilities and follows through on its promises. An organization's sustainability strategy and actions play a significant role in attracting and retaining employees. \n\nAt Spotify, we are dedicated to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To achieve this goal, we are evaluating all aspects of our business, including our community events. During the production of Spotifest Stockholm, we followed Greentime's planning tool and focused on areas where we could have the most significant impact. By making changes to the event production and the event itself, we were able to reduce our carbon emissions and promote social change. \n\nIn our efforts to produce a sustainable event, we concentrated on several key areas. We selected a location that already had the necessary event infrastructure, such as electricity, water, Wi-Fi, and toilets, minimizing our ecological, economic, and social footprint. We also chose an event site that was accessible via public transportation to reduce CO2 emissions and save our employees time and money. Additionally, we sourced food from local restaurants, prioritizing vegetarian/vegan options and supporting local, organic, and fair-trade practices. \n\nAs part of our commitment to substance awareness and support, we created an atmosphere at the event that focused on creativity and inspiration, rather than alcohol-centric activities. We offered a wide range of non-alcoholic beverages to cater to all preferences. All food and beverages were served in reusable or recyclable, non-plastic packaging to minimize waste. \n\nEnsuring the safety and security of our employees, suppliers, and performers is of utmost importance to us. We implemented a comprehensive security plan, including proper fencing, guards, emergency exits, and first aid, in collaboration with the most experienced security company in the industry. These measures were put in place to ensure a safe and secure environment for all attendees and staff."}]}

While this may be difficult, it is often necessary to ensure the health of the business. These situations truly test an organization's values. It is easy for companies to claim a people-first approach during good times, but if their values do not truly support a human-centric way of running a business, it will become evident.\n\nIn the current climate, it is crucial for us to be more conscious of our spending. We can no longer afford to prioritize unnecessary indulgences and must instead focus on essential resources. While these indulgences may provide a temporary boost, they lack long-term impact and strategic value. HR professionals should avoid these short-term fixes and instead invest in initiatives that deliver sustainable outcomes.\n\nIt is important to note that not everything that appears sweet is actually beneficial. Building a strong cultural fabric, akin to building strong muscles, is necessary to weather stormy times. At Spotify, our Community Experience team (CommunityX) believes that elevating the employee experience is not just empty calories. In fact, enhancing a sense of belonging through community-building initiatives yields a return on investment. When employees feel a strong sense of belonging, they perform at their best and are more likely to stay with the company.\n\nLooking ahead, when the economic landscape stabilizes, having a solid foundation built on a sense of belonging will provide a competitive advantage. At Spotify, our CommunityX team creates spaces and opportunities for people to connect, align teams, and focus their efforts for maximum impact. We have proactively invested in tools for virtual collaboration and created an internal talent marketplace to broaden networking and upskilling opportunities.\n\nHowever, it is not enough to simply facilitate connections within teams or departments. Multiple opportunities and approaches are necessary to build a robust web of connections that withstands the test of time and future challenges. By creating meaningful shared experiences, even in times of remote work, we can foster a strong sense of togetherness and resilience."}]}

CEO Doug McMillon participated in the opening ceremony of a green hydrogen plant at Walmart's Quilicura distribution center in Santiago, Chile. This event signifies our ongoing investment in and dedication to renewable energy. Developed in collaboration with Engie, the project is both industrial-scale and renewable, making it the first of its kind in Latin America. This plant will play a vital role in Walmart Chile's journey towards achieving net-zero emissions.\n\nDuring the event, McMillon was joined by Walmart Chile CEO Cristi\u00e1n Barrientos, Chile's Minister of Finance Mario Marcel, Chile's Minister of Energy Diego Pardow, and Engie Chile's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Pablo Villarino. They acknowledged the plant's opening as a critical step in Walmart's global commitment to becoming a regenerative and zero-emission company by 2040.\n\nBarrientos expressed enthusiasm for the project, stating, \"We see tremendous potential for our business and aim to expand the use of this technology to all distribution centers in our logistics network throughout the country. Our goal is to operate 100% with green hydrogen by 2025.\" He also mentioned ongoing explorations of new applications in the transport and emergency services sectors.\n\nIn its initial phase, the green hydrogen plant will enable the Quilicura distribution center to replace the lead-acid batteries of 200 forklift cranes with hydrogen energy cells, resulting in a reduction of 250 tons of toxic waste annually. Over the course of the 15-year project, Walmart expects to reduce CO2 emissions by 17,100 tons, equivalent to planting 34,200 trees.\n\nMcMillon highlighted Walmart's long-standing commitment to hydrogen fuel, starting with a fleet of 50 vehicles and forklifts in the United States in 2012. Today, Walmart operates over 9,500 forklifts using hydrogen fuel. With this experience and progress, Walmart is now well-positioned to invest in Chile's potential as a clean energy producer, particularly in green hydrogen. Chile's commitment to renewable energy, evident in the significant growth of its solar and wind power sectors, provides a unique opportunity to develop a competitive green hydrogen industry driven by low-cost renewable resources and a sustainable economy.\n\nWalmart has already made remarkable strides towards its climate goals, such as incorporating renewable sources through self-generation and the purchase of certified renewable energy. Currently, 84% of Walmart Chile's energy consumption comes from clean sources, and the company's over 390 facilities are on track to achieve the goal of operating with 100% renewable energy well before the global commitment of 2035.\n\nMcMillon emphasized Walmart's aspiration to become a regenerative company, aiming to leave a positive impact on the environment.

By implementing these changes, Walmart aims to reduce waste from the hundreds of millions of packages it ships each year.\n\nTo minimize plastic waste, Walmart will now ship nearly all orders in recyclable paper bag mailers, eliminating an estimated 65 million plastic bag mailers or over 2,000 tons of plastic from circulation in the US by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, customers will soon have the choice to opt out of single-use plastic bags for online pickup orders, which could potentially eliminate millions of single-use bags each year. Walmart plans to rollout this option nationwide by the end of the year.\n\nWalmart is also implementing right-sized packaging technology in approximately half of its fulfillment network to reduce the amount of cardboard used to ship products. This technology creates custom-fitted packages for each customer's order, reducing the need for filler by 60% and minimizing waste from oversized boxes by up to 26%. Customers can also request consolidation of multiple items into fewer boxes during online checkout, further reducing waste and the number of shipments.\n\nIn an effort to achieve faster delivery and reduce mileage and box usage, Walmart utilizes AI technology to fulfill online orders from its stores, rather than solely relying on fulfillment centers. This approach reduces the number of miles driven and boxes used for shipping. To ensure sustainable transportation, Walmart combines multiple orders on single delivery routes and employs electric vans for delivery. These initiatives align with Walmart's commitment to achieving zero emissions by 2040 and make use of its extensive store network as fulfillment centers.\n\nWith a 27% growth in Walmart's ecommerce, the company continues to invest in omnichannel capabilities to meet evolving customer needs while prioritizing sustainability. These efforts reflect Walmart's commitment to becoming a regenerative company, focusing on social and environmental issues that are relevant to its business and stakeholders.

The discussions took place during stage three of the bank's monetary policy decision-making process, after members had received all staff briefings and recommendations. The policy decision-making meetings began on July 5, with Governor Tiff Macklem presiding over the meetings. In attendance were Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers and Deputy Governors Paul Beaudry, Toni Gravelle, Sharon Kozicki, and Nicolas Vincent.\n\nThe council started by discussing recent global economic developments. Overall, the global economy was stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, despite some growth slowdown. Consumer and business spending, particularly in the United States, remained resilient. Lower oil prices and easing goods price inflation had contributed to a decline in headline inflation in most advanced economies. The council noted three common themes across advanced economies:\n\n1. Measures of core inflation remained stubborn due to robust consumer demand, tight labor markets, and elevated inflation expectations.\n2. Supply bottlenecks had been largely resolved, and while manufacturing was slowing due to weaker demand for goods, demand for services remained strong.\n3. Despite previous monetary policy tightening, underlying inflation pressures persisted, leading major central banks to signal the possibility of further tightening to address inflation.\n\nMembers observed that economic activity in the United States had exceeded expectations, driven by robust consumer spending supported by a strong job market and increased savings. In contrast, growth in the euro area had essentially stalled in the first half of 2023 due to weak consumer demand for goods and tighter monetary policy. However, the services sector remained resilient due to pent-up demand. The Chinese economy was projected to slow more than previously anticipated after a strong rebound, leading to slower global growth, reduced manufacturing, and weaker exports. The Chinese property sector remained weak, which had implications for oil prices and non-energy commodity demand.\n\nThe council acknowledged a decline in oil prices since the last projection, but highlighted the potential for prices to rise again if global supply fails to keep up with demand. Voluntary production cuts by some OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers may counterbalance any softness in demand arising from slower global growth and a greater-than-expected slowdown in China.\n\nRegarding financial stability, the council agreed that the risk of global banking strains had diminished but not disappeared. Yields on government bonds in Europe and North America had increased, while equity prices had strengthened overall since June.\n\nIn terms of the Canadian economy, council members reviewed the evidence accumulated over the past few months since the previous decision in June. They discussed the factors contributing to the surprisingly strong growth in consumer spending in the first quarter of 2023. These factors included tight labor markets, solid income growth, additional savings accumulated by Canadians during the pandemic, strong population growth in the first quarter, and pent-up demand for services as Canadians resumed activities they were unable to participate in during the pandemic."}]}

I am delighted to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss today's policy announcement and the Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Today, we have increased our policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%. Additionally, we will continue our policy of quantitative tightening. \n\nThis decision is based on two main considerations. Firstly, while monetary policy has been effective, underlying inflationary pressures are proving to be more persistent than anticipated. Although we have made significant progress in combating inflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation decreasing from 8.1% last summer to 3.4% in May, underlying inflation remains stubborn. We need higher interest rates to slow down demand growth in the economy and alleviate price pressures. \n\nSecondly, we are aiming to strike a balance between the risks of tightening and loosening monetary policy. If we take insufficient action now, we may need to take more drastic measures in the future. Conversely, if we overreact, we risk creating unnecessary economic hardships. We have made substantial progress and must not squander it. Our objective is to maintain the course and restore price stability for Canadians. \n\nAllow me to elaborate on these considerations and emphasize a few key points from the Governing Council's discussions. Global growth has exceeded expectations since the beginning of the year. Lower energy prices and restrained price increases for goods have contributed to a decline in global inflation. However, inflationary pressures in services persist due to robust demand and tight labor markets. The Bank projects stronger global economic growth for this year compared to our previous forecasts in January and April. A similar trend is observed in Canada, where growth has been surprisingly robust, and the economy remains in high demand. Consumer spending on services remains strong, and although spending on interest rate-sensitive goods has slowed, it has not decelerated as much as anticipated. The housing market has also experienced an increase in activity. \n\nSeveral factors are supporting household spending. While the labor market is showing signs of easing, it remains tight. The unemployment rate has slightly increased but remains historically low, and wage growth has been between 4% and 5%, which is higher than what is considered consistent with price stability. Moreover, many households have accumulated savings during the COVID-19 pandemic, which act as a buffer and support consumer spending. Rapid population growth is contributing to both supply and demand in the economy. Newcomers to Canada are entering the labor force, alleviating labor shortages, while also increasing consumer spending and housing demand. \n\nRegarding inflation, although CPI inflation has decreased relatively quickly, much of this decline can be attributed to lower energy prices and the base-year effects of significant price increases witnessed last year. However, we are still observing substantial price increases across a wide range of goods and services. Our measures of core inflation, which gauge underlying inflationary pressures, have declined, but not as much as expected. Three-month rates of core inflation have remained around 3.5% to 4% since September, indicating limited downward momentum in inflation. While consumer and business expectations for near-term inflation are moderating, they still remain elevated. Additionally, businesses report more frequent price increases compared to pre-pandemic levels."}]}

This summary reflects the deliberations and discussions that took place during the council's third stage of decision-making, after receiving staff briefings and recommendations.\n\nThe meetings were presided over by Governor Tiff Macklem, with the attendance of Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers and Deputy Governors Paul Beaudry, Toni Gravelle, and Sharon Kozicki.\n\nThe council started by reviewing recent international developments, including the significant decline in global energy prices and the ongoing easing of global supply chain bottlenecks. Notably, COVID-19 restrictions in China were abruptly lifted. Overall, global economic activity, particularly in the United States, the euro area, and China, exceeded the bank's expectations from the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). However, council members still anticipated a significant slowdown in global growth in 2023 as pent-up demand subsides and higher interest rates restrain activity.\n\nIn terms of inflation, while it remained high and broad-based, it had receded from its peak in many countries. The council discussed how market narratives about the global economy and inflation were shifting.\n\nThe council also assessed the revised outlook for the United States, noting that while consumers remained resilient, growth was expected to be relatively flat in 2023. The labor market remained tight, and inflation was decreasing due to lower energy prices. However, negotiations related to the debt ceiling could pose risks of financial volatility if an agreement is not reached.\n\nRegarding the euro area, the council anticipated a mild recession despite its surprising resilience so far. Risks associated with the Russian war in Ukraine continued to create uncertainty, and higher interest rates were impacting growth.\n\nConsiderable time was spent discussing the situation in China, particularly the rapid shift in the country's approach to COVID-19. The council highlighted the potential upside risk to oil prices if Chinese demand rebounded more than anticipated, which could put renewed pressure on Canadian and global inflation.\n\nFinancial conditions were reviewed, with the council noting that despite continued policy tightening by central banks, conditions had eased somewhat since October. This was attributed to a decline in risk premiums across asset classes, driven by a decrease in headline inflation and a perceived reduction in the risk of a severe recession. The Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate remained stable at around 74 cents.\n\nIn terms of domestic data, Canada's GDP grew by 2.9% in the third quarter, surpassing the bank's expectations. However, softer household spending offset the strength from commodity exports, resulting in declines in consumption and housing activity. Nevertheless, data suggested that GDP growth in the fourth quarter would likely surpass previous projections, indicating more excess demand in the economy than anticipated.\n\nThe tightness in the labor market persisted, as indicated by the December Labor Force Survey (LFS) reporting unexpectedly strong job gains. This, along with other indicators, confirmed the council's view that the economy was still experiencing excess demand. Wage momentum was seen to be plateauing in the range of 4% to 5%, which was not viewed as consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target unless productivity significantly improved.\n\nOverall, the governing council concluded that the economy was slowing but still had more excess demand than expected. They acknowledged the tight labor market as a symptom of the economy's current state and recognized the need for increased productivity to achieve the inflation target."}]}

While inflation is showing signs of improvement, Macklem acknowledged that there is still work to be done.\n\nMacklem emphasized that higher interest rates can be challenging for Canadians, but they are necessary to combat the potentially worse effects of persistently high inflation. The bank's monetary policy is making progress, although not as quickly or painlessly as desired.\n\nAlthough the Bank of Canada typically holds its meetings in Ottawa, they occasionally meet in different regions to engage with communities and understand their concerns. During the lunch event in Kelowna, Macklem delivered a brief speech and participated in a fireside chat alongside Carolyn Rogers, Senior Deputy Governor at the Bank of Canada. They addressed various topics, including the bank's response to the pandemic, confidence in Canadian and US banks, and digital currency.\n\nMacklem highlighted that inflation in Canada has reached levels not seen in almost four decades. While the rate is decreasing, it remains higher than desired. He explained the bank's recent decision to raise its policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point, noting that this was the most rapid interest rate increase in Canadian history. However, it takes time for these higher rates to impact the economy.\n\nThe Bank of Canada had paused rate increases in January to assess their impact on inflation and the economy. However, recent indicators have shown that the overheating economy has been more persistent than anticipated. While headline inflation is gradually decreasing, underlying inflation, which excludes volatile factors like food and energy prices, remains stubborn. Macklem expressed concern that it is not declining as hoped, highlighting ongoing labor shortages and an overheated economy as contributing factors.\n\nMacklem believes that inflation will decrease to around three percent by the summer. On the other hand, the Bank of Canada does not have a specific target for unemployment. To achieve the inflation target, the bank aims to achieve a reasonable balance in the labor market. When the labor market is tight and companies struggle to find workers, shortages occur, leading to price increases and inflation.\n\nThe local economy of the Central Okanagan region, where the lunch event took place, presented unique insights to Macklem. He observed a significant influx of immigrants from other parts of Canada and recognized the attractiveness of the area, particularly with the presence of a university campus. While traditional industries like agriculture, forestry, mining, and manufacturing remain robust, Macklem highlighted the growing importance of the tech sector.\n\nDespite the positive aspects and opportunities present in the region, labor shortages are a common challenge faced by the entire country. Affordable housing is also a concern in Kelowna, although Macklem noted that this issue is not exclusive to the area. The Bank of Canada considers the housing market when formulating monetary policy, but it prioritizes inflation as the key determinant of interest rates.\n\nIn a one-on-one interview with The Daily Courier, Macklem expressed his appreciation for the region's strengths and potential. He acknowledged the positive economic factors but acknowledged the need to address labor shortages and housing affordability, not only in Kelowna but nationwide."}]}

The gatekeepers mockingly reveal that homemade sourdough bread has become the currency of the future, highlighting the current trend of breadmaking during the pandemic. While this surge in breadmaking may seem peculiar, there is a profound therapeutic aspect to the act of creating bread and other daily creative endeavors.\n\nBaking bread, as Stephen S. Jones, director of Washington State University's Bread Lab, explains, can be a spiritually fulfilling experience. Some individuals, who have experienced immense grief such as losing a child, have turned to breadmaking as a means of coping. Bread, with its living nature, allows individuals to connect with the process and find solace within its creation.\n\nEngaging in daily creative practices, such as baking bread, writing poetry, sketching, or even trying new creative pursuits, can have a profound impact on our well-being. While mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation are commonly recommended to alleviate anxiety, making something every day serves as an alternative and equally effective approach. By channeling our energy into creative outlets, we can find meaning in our circumstances and maintain a calm and positive attitude.\n\nThe duration of daily creative practices can be as short as 20 to 60 seconds, emphasizing the importance of consistency rather than time commitment. Numerous examples demonstrate the healing power of daily creative endeavors, such as an individual creating a song each day to cope with emotional turmoil or a designer drawing something every day after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIf you're interested in starting a daily creative practice but unsure how to begin, here's some advice. It's not necessary to commit to 100 days; even 10 days can make a difference. Just as physical exercise helps boost our energy during this challenging time, daily creative endeavors can provide a similar sense of fulfillment. Rather than viewing isolation as lost time, embrace the opportunity to do something meaningful. Who knows, you may even discover a deep passion for your creations. When all of this is over, reflecting on your daily creative practice might be the one thing that made isolation bearable."}]}

It introduced a rigid safety cell, large front and rear crumple zones, and a fortified battery pack. In 2014, it achieved a 5-star Euro NCAP rating and 5 stars in every NHTSA category, setting a benchmark for the automotive industry. At Tesla, we prioritize safety by adopting a dual approach to engineering. We develop both passive and active safety systems that aim to reduce the effects of accidents and prevent them altogether.\n\nSince its release, we have continuously made iterative improvements to the Model S safety systems. We stay up-to-date with increasingly stringent safety test protocols and strive to engineer the safest vehicles on the road. Instead of waiting for yearly releases, we promptly implement safety improvements through manufacturing and engineering changes in new vehicles, as well as over-the-air updates to existing fleet vehicles. This ensures that all customers receive the latest and most advanced safety features throughout our lineup.\n\nLast year, we released a new Model S that underwent testing by Euro NCAP against their newest and most rigorous 2020-2022 protocol. This protocol evaluates the vehicle's ability to protect adults, children, and vulnerable road users, as well as its proficiency in crash avoidance and other safety assistance features. The Model S received a 5-star safety rating and achieved the highest overall score among all the vehicles tested under this protocol. It also performed exceptionally well in detailed tests across the board.\n\nThese impressive ratings are due in part to the new safety features that now come standard in all new Model S vehicles. These features include a collision avoidance driver monitoring system, advanced front-structure castings, automatic airbag suppression for child seats, a far-side airbag for side impacts, multi-collision braking, and a steering yoke that deploys an airbag and provides an unobstructed view.\n\nPreventing accidents is crucial to protecting occupants. The Model S received a remarkable score of 98% in Euro NCAP's 2022 safety assist category, which evaluates the effectiveness of software features in reducing accident risks. Tesla Vision, our camera vision and neural-net processing system, now comes standard in all Tesla vehicles, providing advanced safety assistance.\n\nWhile the new Model X has not received a safety rating yet, it is equipped with all the aforementioned safety features. Deliveries of both the Model S and Model X will begin in Europe before the end of the year. Additionally, the Model Y has received a 5-star Euro NCAP rating this year.\n\nAt Tesla, safety is our top priority. While our vehicles offer exhilarating features like fast acceleration, console-grade in-car gaming, and sublime sound, safety always comes first. With the Model S, we aimed to deliver a significant improvement in safety befitting of our flagship vehicle. Like all Tesla vehicles, we will continue to enhance safety through over-the-air software updates.\n\nOverall, our commitment to safety remains unwavering, and we strive to provide the safest driving experience for our customers."}]}

This marks a 15% increase over the past three years. Notably, the costs associated with detection and escalation have surged by 42% during the same period, making up the largest portion of breach expenses. This indicates a shift towards more complex breach investigations.\n\nThe report also highlights that businesses are divided in their strategies for addressing the rising cost and frequency of data breaches. While 95% of organizations surveyed have experienced multiple breaches, those that have been breached are more likely to pass incident costs onto consumers (57%) rather than increase investments in security (51%).\n\nThe 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report is based on an in-depth analysis of real-world data breaches encountered by 553 organizations worldwide between March 2022 and March 2023. The research, sponsored and analyzed by IBM Security and conducted by Ponemon Institute, has been published for 18 consecutive years.\n\nSome key findings from the 2023 IBM report are as follows:\n\n1. AI and automation have significantly accelerated breach identification and containment for organizations. Those extensively utilizing these technologies experienced breach lifecycles that were, on average, 108 days shorter compared to organizations that have not deployed them (214 days versus 322 days).\n\n2. Organizations that involved law enforcement in ransomware attacks saved an average of $470,000 in breach costs compared to those that did not seek law enforcement assistance. Despite these potential savings, 37% of ransomware victims studied chose not to involve law enforcement.\n\n3. Only one-third of breaches studied were detected by the organization's own security team, while 27% were disclosed by the attacker. Breaches disclosed by attackers incurred an average cost nearly $1 million higher than those identified by the breached organizations themselves.\n\nThe 2023 report underscores the importance of deploying security AI and automation for faster breach response and reduced incident costs. Organizations that fully adopted these technologies experienced breach lifecycles that were 108 days shorter on average and incurred almost $1.8 million lower data breach costs than those that did not deploy them. This finding marks the most significant cost-saving measure identified in the report.\n\nRegarding ransomware attacks, the report challenges the misconception that involving law enforcement complicates the situation and shows evidence to the contrary. Organizations that engaged law enforcement experienced breach lifecycles that were, on average, 33 days shorter compared to those that did not involve law enforcement. Choosing not to involve law enforcement resulted in an average increase of $470,000 in breach costs. Despite ongoing efforts by law enforcement to collaborate with ransomware victims, 37% of respondents still opted not to seek their assistance. Additionally, 47% of studied ransomware victims reportedly paid the ransom. It is clear that organizations should abandon these misconceptions and understand that paying a ransom and avoiding law enforcement can lead to higher incident costs and slower responses.\n\nWhile there have been some advancements in threat detection and response, the report highlights that security teams rarely discover breaches on their own. Only one in three breaches studied were detected internally, while 27% were revealed by the attacker, and 40% were disclosed by a neutral third party, such as law enforcement.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report provides valuable insights into the increasing costs and complexities of data breaches. It emphasizes the importance of deploying security AI and automation, involving law enforcement in ransomware attacks, and improving threat detection capabilities to mitigate the significant financial and reputational risks associated with data breaches."}]}

Sid Paquette, the head of RBCX, recognizes the challenges that come with the presence of global tech giants in Canada, but remains optimistic about the country's potential. The increase in international venture capital funding is a testament to Canada's innovation ecosystem and a positive indicator for its future prospects.\n\nSid believes that while foreign investment has contributed to the growth of the tech industry in Canada, it is essential to have more home-grown companies that can compete on a global scale. Currently, there are limited examples of Canadian companies achieving the same level of growth as global firms. To address this, Sid emphasizes the need for entrepreneurs to have the necessary resources, mentorship, and opportunities to build successful organizations.\n\nCanada offers favorable incentives for intellectual property creation, research and development activities, and company creation and hiring. However, there is room for improvement in the commercialization of ideas. Sid suggests revising intellectual property laws to prevent multinational corporations from acquiring Canadian innovations that were funded through public programs. Additionally, he proposes implementing incentives to retain talent in Canada and streamlining the immigration process to facilitate the settlement of newcomers.\n\nBanks also have a role to play in nurturing the tech and innovation ecosystem. While they can provide capital, Sid believes that leveraging their capabilities further is crucial.

Clayton believes that without this opportunity, he would have been disconnected from his culture.\n\nFor Brayden Omeasoo-Steinhauer of the Ermineskin Cree Nation, the healing process includes reconnecting with his culture to help heal past wounds. His grandparents were not allowed to speak their Cree language while attending school, resulting in a prominent challenge in Brayden's life. As a third-year student at the University of Alberta, he plans to learn Cree in order to establish a deeper connection with his heritage and better understand the wisdom shared by elders and knowledge keepers at cultural and ceremonial events. Brayden aims to break the cycle of disconnection caused by the Indian residential school system.\n\nRecipients also highlight the awe-inspiring resiliency passed down by survivors of the residential school system. Mercedes Stemm of the Natoaganeg First Nation in New Brunswick admires her grandmother's ability to maintain her culture and pass on cultural practices despite enduring torture during school. Mercedes, a first-year medical student at the University of Manitoba, plans to continue passing on her culture to her nieces, nephews, and as many people as possible. Her goal is to become a doctor and establish a clinic in her community, which lacked physicians and clinics during her upbringing. Mercedes intends to use ancestral knowledge taught by her grandmother and other elders to improve the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in Canada.\n\nCommunity support has also been a significant source of strength for young Indigenous individuals. Saalia Pijamini, an Inuk from Grise Fiord, Nunavut, grew up speaking her mother tongue, Inuktitut, and is passionate about her culture and traditional foods. She describes her community as a big family, where everyone knows, supports, and takes care of each other. Saalia, a second-year student at Nunavut Arctic College, has always aspired to be a teacher. Her goal is to return to her home community and teach at the school where she grew up and graduated, giving back to the institution that shaped her into the person she is today."}]}

This work is not just a profession for her, but a personal passion as well. Her family has been farming in Canada for over 100 years, providing cereals for our breakfast tables and grazing land for livestock. With experience managing nearly 30,000 acres of farmland, Janet understands the challenges faced by farmers today.\n\nThe biggest challenge keeping farmers awake at night is the issue of costs. Janet explains, \"Managing costs is now more demanding than farming itself, which is something I haven't seen in 40 years.\" Rising prices affect all Canadians due to disruptions in supply chains and international security challenges. Farmers and their families bear the brunt of these costs. Ukraine, a key agricultural region, has experienced limitations in supplying global markets due to war and the pandemic. This has caused a significant impact on the supply chain, resulting in a rise of fertilizer prices by up to 300% in 2022.\n\nWhile large industrial farms can better withstand this volatility, small and mid-sized farms have less control over input costs. With commodity prices rapidly increasing, farmers must rely on shopping around or timing the market to secure favorable prices. This additional burden of finding the right price is unwelcome for farmers who cherish their land. Furthermore, persistent supply disruptions caused by COVID-19 have stalled farmers' plans to upgrade or replace equipment and machinery. These items have become more expensive and harder to find, and suppliers struggle to provide delivery dates or final prices due to constrained supply. This makes budget planning significantly more challenging for many farmers.\n\nJanet mentions that rising interest rates have doubled loan payments for clients. Conversations about cash flow have become more in-depth and frequent as farmers need assistance in adapting to this environment. It is clear that farmers are facing increased pressure from a climate-conscious world. Climate disruption, global population growth, economic volatility, and geopolitical stability are all factors that put immense pressure on Canada's farms to sustainably feed the world.\n\nRecognizing these challenges, RBC Economics & Thought Leadership has released a report titled \"Fertile Ground: How Soil Carbon Can Be a Cash Crop for the Climate Age.\" The report explores three ways to mobilize capital for reducing emissions in Canada's agriculture sector. Canada's farms manage one of the world's largest inventories of agricultural land, and sustainable practices can provide farmers with the power to cut emissions and improve air and water quality, soil health, and biodiversity. The report identifies carbon offsets, carbon insets, and government funding as financial instruments that can facilitate this transition to sustainable agriculture practices. Insetting and government funding hold the greatest potential to make an immediate impact.\n\nIn summary, Janet Heathcoat's extensive experience in supporting agriculture clients has given her valuable insights into the challenges faced by farmers today. Rising costs, supply disruptions, and the need to adapt to a climate-conscious world have created significant obstacles. However, RBC Economics & Thought Leadership's report provides potential solutions, such as carbon offsets, carbon insets, and government funding, to support the transition to sustainable agriculture practices. By mobilizing capital and addressing economic barriers, we can create a more sustainable future for Canada's farms."}]}

RBC, for example, has set a GHG reduction goal of 70% by 2025 for its operations. One key step towards achieving this ambitious goal is sourcing all of its electricity from renewable and non-emitting sources, such as wind and solar power.\n\nJulia-Maria Becker, Senior Manager of Sustainable Enterprise Operations at RBC, explains that there are multiple ways for RBC to accomplish this. However, investing in new renewable energy projects is particularly impactful in supporting Canada's energy transition, which is where Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) come into play.\n\nA PPA is a long-term contract between a corporate buyer, such as RBC, and a renewable energy project owner. It allows the buyer to purchase energy at a fixed price from a solar or wind farm connected to the electrical grid. PPAs have played a significant role in driving renewable energy development in North America, according to Grant Arnold, President and CEO of BluEarth Renewables. Corporate buyers like RBC have contributed to the substantial growth of renewables over the past five years.\n\nIn 2020, RBC signed a PPA with BluEarth Renewables to directly support the construction of two new utility-scale solar farms in Alberta. In March 2022, RBC signed another PPA with Berkshire Hathaway Energy Canada (BHE Canada) to support the development of their new Rattlesnake Wind Power Project in Medicine Hat, Alberta. PPAs provide project owners with greater certainty, as the fixed price agreed upon by the purchaser ensures that the project will move forward.\n\nPPAs offer benefits to all parties involved. For RBC, they provide predictable access to renewable electricity, aiding in the achievement of its climate goals. Simultaneously, they contribute to the growth of renewable energy facilities in Canada. Energy consumers benefit from the long-term, predictable supply of electricity with a defined price and volume. Additionally, PPAs have far-reaching advantages for communities, including job creation during construction. The Bluearth Yellow Lake and Burdett Solar Project, for example, created over 300 new construction jobs, while BHE Canada's wind project provided approximately 150 new construction jobs at its peak.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, these projects generate economic stability within communities, with an anticipated injection of $200 million into Alberta's economy from the solar and wind projects, according to estimates from the partners. Furthermore, the clean electricity purchased by RBC from these projects is expected to prevent 41,200 tonnes of emissions annually, equivalent to approximately 680,000 tree seedlings grown for 10 years or 167 million fewer kilometers driven.\n\nThese projects also highlight the cost-competitiveness of renewable energy in an open market and demonstrate that PPAs can facilitate green investment in Alberta's economy. Despite common misconceptions, renewables have become increasingly affordable, with wind power prices dropping by 72% since 2009 and solar power prices decreasing by 90%, making them the most cost-effective form of new energy, according to the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2020."}]}

We are fully committed to change and progress, and we will actively lead the way in accelerating the transition to a net-zero world. This includes working closely with our clients to support and enable their plans, as well as implementing sustainable practices in our own operations.\n\nOur climate strategy is clear and comprehensive, encompassing both short-term and long-term actions and commitments to achieve net-zero in our lending by 2050. As one of the largest global financial institutions, we will leverage our resources and expertise in every sector and community to make a meaningful impact.\n\nHere are the four key ways in which we will make a difference:\n\n1. Helping clients transition to net-zero: We will collaborate with our clients to understand and shape their journeys towards net-zero, offering financing, products, and services to support their efforts.\n\n2. Holding ourselves accountable: We will set interim financed emission reduction targets aligned with our clients' plans and transparently measure and monitor our progress through our lending portfolio.\n\n3. Advancing a sustainable future: We will drive progress in climate solutions and policies through thought leadership, partnerships across public and private sectors, and support for technological innovation.\n\n4. Demonstrating net-zero leadership in our own operations: By 2025, we will transition to 100% renewable energy sources and minimize our reliance on carbon offsets. This approach will enable us to reach net-zero.\n\nFundamentally, our approach to this multi-decade transition is orderly, ensuring a balance between the needs of individuals, companies, regions, society, and the economy.

However, there are other factors that are becoming increasingly important. When considering a job, it is no longer just about perks like free snacks and a ping-pong table. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted priorities, and Canadian employees now seek meaningful support in both work and life.\n\nA flexible benefits plan that caters to employees' needs in different life stages is at the top of their list. David Schwarz, who leads compensations and benefits at RBC, highlights the importance of premium offerings that support mental wellbeing, physical health, and financial planning. Providing a modern and comprehensive benefits experience helps employees in crucial moments throughout their career, whether they are just starting or nearing retirement.\n\nShort-term financial goals also play a significant role. Nicholas Mizera, an RBC employee, was able to save approximately $250 per month by taking advantage of discounts and savings offered to employees. By utilizing employee pricing on telecom plans, home and auto insurance, and a credit card with rewards points covering its annual fee, he has achieved peace of mind and the ability to provide for his family.\n\nBeyond tangible benefits, intangible factors positively impact the workplace experience. Feeling accepted and a sense of belonging are crucial, according to Christina Cleveland, RBC's Vice President of Global Diversity & Inclusion. RBC encourages this through Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), where over 32,000 employees participate. These groups bring together individuals with shared identities, characteristics, or interests, making it easier for them to find their community and engage with issues that matter to them both inside and outside of work.\n\nKaelan Karjalainen found her community as an active volunteer with the Greater Toronto Area Pride ERG. Through this group, she has been able to bring her ideas to life and support the 2SLGBTQ+ community. The ERG has organized various employee engagement events, such as participating in Toronto Pride Parades, fundraising events for National Coming Out Day, and virtual Pride celebrations during the pandemic.\n\nEmployees, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are seeking work that has a meaningful impact. Great Place to Work data shows that these generations are three times more likely to stay with a company if they find the work meaningful. Ashley Tidd, a mortgage specialist at RBC, finds fulfillment in her role as she helps clients and families navigate the mortgage process, a significant milestone in their lives. Being able to assist clients in achieving their lifelong goal of owning a home is incredibly rewarding for her.\n\nFurthermore, employees are more inclined to work for socially responsible organizations that have charitable giving programs. This is supported by the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\nIn summary, while competitive salaries remain a top priority for job seekers, other factors such as relevant benefits, a sense of belonging, and opportunities to make a meaningful impact are gaining importance. Employers who provide comprehensive benefits, foster inclusivity through ERGs, and offer opportunities for employees to contribute to their communities are more likely to attract and retain top talent."}]}

As a New York Times best-selling author and teamwork coach, she helps organizations understand the significance of trust, a small word with immense meaning.\n\nResearch from Harvard Business Review highlights that employees in high-trust companies are more productive, energetic, collaborative, and loyal compared to those in low-trust companies. Recently, Liane addressed people managers at RBC, as part of their ongoing leadership development focus, sharing insights on how our brains perceive trust, the impact of the pandemic, and practical methods to enhance trust in the workplace.\n\nThe key lies in who we trust. Our brains process information differently depending on its source. If feedback comes from someone we don't trust, frustration and doubt are likely to arise. However, when feedback comes from a trusted individual, we are more receptive. Liane explains that trust shapes our interpretation of neutral information as it relates to psychological safety. Being vulnerable is easier with someone we trust. When employees feel comfortable taking risks, such as sharing information, seeking help, resolving challenging situations, and supporting others, team effectiveness increases.\n\nErin Stein, who oversees leadership development and culture at RBC, emphasizes that trust is fundamental to all aspects of work. For people managers, establishing trust with their teams is especially crucial as it enables peak performance.\n\nLiane identifies four levels of trust: connection, competency, reliability, and integrity. Building connections is the initial step. However, during the pandemic, establishing trust became more challenging in a two-dimensional, virtual environment. Liane suggests engaging in non-task-related activities, like virtual lunches, to foster trust. Wearing company gear also strengthens the sense of unity and connection.\n\nEstablishing trust early with teammates is vital. Instead of waiting until issues arise, proactive behavior should be acknowledged and encouraged. Integrity is another critical aspect of trust. Admitting mistakes and promptly learning from them sets an example for others. Additionally, exercising discretion and avoiding team discussions on sensitive issues prevents gossip. Instead, confide in peers when necessary.\n\nEffective listening is the final and most important skill. At RBC, leaders demonstrate the core behavior of listening. Active listening involves paying attention to both verbal and non-verbal cues, as emotions often manifest through body language. Avoid multitasking and give conversations your undivided attention. Asking open-ended questions to clarify understanding fosters trust in our work and, more importantly, with our colleagues."}]}

She had always been focused on pursuing a career in the theatre. However, after some time in London's West End, she began to reconsider. The theatre industry often involves long hours, irregular schedules, and numerous challenges. Following an eye-opening audition for Phantom of the Opera, Corstorphine realized she was ready for a career with a more predictable schedule.\n\nIn 2012, after returning to Canada, Corstorphine found herself soul searching. Having previously worked at RBC during her college summers, she decided to return temporarily while she figured out her next steps. More than ten years later, she is celebrating a recent promotion in an industry she never intended to pursue, proudly referring to herself as the \"accidental banker.\"\n\nCorstorphine acknowledges that she has always had a knack for numbers, but she used to find them boring. However, she now sees that numbers are just one aspect of her role, and there are many other pieces to the puzzle.

However, with the guidance of a supportive leader, she was able to explore different areas within RBC and find a role that not only provided the consistency she desired but also allowed her to fulfill her creative side.\n\nAlthough her career in banking was an accident, it has proven to be a perfect fit for Corstorphine."}]}

Flora Do, Vice President of Investments Transformation & Client Segments at RBC, shared that there has been a remarkable level of interest in this tax-free account, especially among younger Canadians who are working towards building a down payment for their first home. Since its launch in April, tens of thousands of Canadians have opened FHSA accounts with RBC, indicating an exceptional early adoption of this innovative savings and investment option.\n\nRBC offers FHSA accounts through RBC Direct Investing, RBC InvestEase, and RBC Online Banking, providing digital access and convenience to clients. Clients can open FHSA accounts digitally through any of these online platforms, and they can also seek assistance from financial advisors at RBC branches to learn more about the FHSA and its advantages compared to other investment options available to support them on their home buying journey.\n\nFurthermore, RBC is committed to educating future homebuyers about the various investment opportunities they can explore within their FHSA. Through RBC Direct Investing, clients have the flexibility to invest in stocks, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), mutual funds, GICs (Guaranteed Investment Certificates), options, and bonds. On the other hand, RBC InvestEase offers a team of portfolio advisors who professionally select, purchase, and manage a portfolio of ETFs based on the client's goals, objectives, and risk tolerance.\n\nIt is important to note that the maximum yearly contribution to an FHSA is $8,000. However, contribution room only starts accumulating once an FHSA has been opened, and any unused contribution room carries forward to the next calendar year. Remarkably, more than one-quarter of RBC FHSA account holders have already contributed the maximum annual amount of $8,000, while an equal percentage are contributing regularly through pre-authorized contributions (PACs). This proactive approach allows Canadians to take advantage of the tax deduction before the end of the 2023 calendar year and also prepares them for monthly or bi-monthly mortgage payments after purchasing their home.\n\nNow let's delve into the statistics behind RBC FHSA accounts. The majority of FHSA holders (56%) fall into the 25 to 34 age group, followed by 20% aged 35 to 44, 18% aged 18 to 24, and 6% aged 45 and older. Additionally, more than one-quarter of FHSA holders are contributing regularly through PACs, giving themselves a head start in saving and investing for their down payment. Moreover, 26% of FHSA account holders have already contributed the maximum annual amount of $8,000, taking full advantage of the available tax deduction for the 2023 calendar year. As of June 30, over 5% of RBC FHSA account holders have made qualifying tax-free withdrawals for their down payment, benefiting from the available tax deduction for the 2023 calendar year. This demonstrates how RBC FHSA accounts are assisting Canadians with both short-term and long-term goals.\n\nIn terms of investment choices, ETFs and stocks are the most common securities held within RBC FHSA accounts. As of June 23, mutual funds have also become available as an investment option through RBC Direct Investing, along with a variety of GICs. This expanded selection allows individuals to diversify their investments and tailor them to their specific preferences.\n\nLastly, Canadians with FHSA accounts who do not pursue home ownership have the option to utilize their FHSA funds for retirement. They can transfer these funds tax-free into their RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) or RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund), without affecting their contribution limits to those accounts. This flexibility ensures that individuals can adapt their savings strategy to their changing circumstances and long-term financial goals."}]}

Tragically, six cadets between the ages of 14 and 15 lost their lives, and many others were injured. The incident occurred when inert explosive devices were mistakenly mixed with a live grenade, which ultimately exploded after a cadet pulled the pin. Following this serious incident, multiple investigations were conducted, including a coroner's report and a military board of inquiry.\n\nThe Office of the Ombudsman first received a complaint regarding this matter in April 2013, and an additional 51 complaints were received over the next three months. These complaints primarily revolved around issues such as access to medical care for long-term injuries, lack of assistance for the most vulnerable individuals still suffering, recognition of the government's responsibility towards the victims, the need for a formal apology, and financial compensation.\n\nAlthough the mandate of the Ombudsman does not typically cover events that occurred prior to June 15, 1998, a pre-mandate investigation was deemed necessary due to the compelling issues and perceived discrepancies in treatment and compensation. The former Minister of National Defence, Rob Nicholson, agreed to this investigation on May 5, 2014.\n\nThe objectives of this investigation were twofold: first, to determine whether those present were treated fairly and compassionately based on the standards in place at the time of the incident, and second, to determine the present-day responsibility, if any, of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces towards the affected individuals.\n\nThe findings of the Ombudsman's office revealed that many of the cadets who survived the explosion continue to suffer from physical and psychological injuries. However, they did not receive the same level of assistance as the military members impacted by the incident. This discrepancy goes against the principle of fairness, as it is not appropriate to provide support to one group while ignoring the other. The report emphasizes that the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence should have done more to assist the young boys who were under their care.\n\nTherefore, the Ombudsman recommends that, following a full assessment and definition of the long-term needs of the affected individuals, the Department of National Defence, under the direction of the Minister, should provide them with immediate and reasonable financial compensation in line with similar situations in jurisprudence. This step is crucial to ensure that these individuals are treated in a manner that aligns with Canadian values."}]}

The purpose of this request is to suggest updates to the agency's processes and the content on Canada.ca, ensuring that taxpayer right 15 of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which states \"you have the right to be represented by a person of your choice,\" is respected.\n\nAt the Chartered Professional Accountants Forum North, we were made aware of concerns regarding the CRA's approach in its assisted compliance program. Upon examining the assisted compliance web page, we discovered that some of the content was encouraging Canadians to contact the CRA before reaching out to their tax preparer, who may also be their authorized representative. Specifically, the page suggested discussing the details of a letter with a CRA officer before contacting one's tax preparer.\n\nEncouraging taxpayers to contact a CRA officer before their tax preparer may present a problem. Taxpayers often rely on the expertise of their representatives for tax planning and may not fully understand the intricate details as they entrust such matters to their representatives. We encountered a similar issue during our examination of the CRA's audit process for charities. In this case, auditors were instructed to contact the director of a charity rather than the authorized representative, even if the representative had previously informed the CRA to correspond with them regarding financial matters.\n\nWhile we understand that there are instances where it may not be the most efficient for the CRA to contact an authorized representative, such as when collecting undisputed debts, the agency should respect a taxpayer's request to communicate with their chosen representative. Therefore, in the service improvement request, the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson requested that the CRA update its publicly available information to remove any suggestions that a taxpayer should contact the CRA first when they intend to be represented by a person of their choice.\n\nUpon receiving the request, the CRA informed us that it was already in the process of updating the assisted compliance program web page. We are pleased to report that the updates have been completed, and the flagged content has been removed from the web page. However, the CRA should continue seeking opportunities to enhance the ease of interaction for taxpayers and their representatives.\n\nBackground information: The Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson operates independently from the CRA. Canadians can submit complaints to our office if they believe they are not receiving appropriate service from the CRA. Our primary objective is to enhance the service provided by the CRA to taxpayers and benefit recipients by reviewing individual service complaints and broader service issues. The Taxpayers' Ombudsperson assists, advises, and informs the Minister of National Revenue on matters related to CRA service provision, ensuring that the agency upholds eight service rights outlined in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights."}]}

Today, the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), in collaboration with Irek Kusmierczyk, Member of Parliament for Windsor-Tecumseh, announced a $200,000 investment for Invest WindsorEssex (IWE) to drive the long-term growth of the EV sector in the Windsor-Essex region.\n\nWindsor-Essex and its neighboring communities are at the forefront of this exciting new chapter in Southern Ontario's automotive sector. The transition to EV and battery manufacturing is generating a range of fresh opportunities for existing suppliers in the region to meet the demand for essential EV parts and technologies. It also showcases to international businesses that Southern Ontario, with its highly skilled workforce, is the ideal destination to support the expansion of the automotive industry.\n\nThrough this investment, IWE will assist in preparing 120 Southern Ontario businesses to participate in the thriving EV market. They will achieve this by identifying and preparing for new supply chain opportunities and strengthening their workforce. Over the next two years, IWE will develop and deliver at least eight new training workshops. This support will ensure that Canadian companies have the necessary talent to build their workforce and contribute to the growth of this crucial sector.\n\nThis investment aims to establish an end-to-end Canadian supply chain that bolsters the competitiveness and success of Canadian workers, businesses, and manufacturers in the automotive industry. It builds upon the $7.5 million investment announced by FedDev Ontario in May 2021 and the $5 million investment announced in 2019 to establish Canada's first world-class automobility accelerator through IWE. This accelerator has been bringing together stakeholders in the region to advance the development of secure, zero-emission vehicle technology.\n\nToday's announcement aligns with our commitment to foster innovation and modernization in the manufacturing sector, leading to economic growth, job creation, and effective climate change mitigation.

For more information, please visit the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise website. \n\nCORE is currently providing an update on the initial assessment stage of a complaint filed on June 21, 2022, by a coalition of 28 Canadian organizations. The complaint concerns the activities of Ralph Lauren Canada LP (RLCLP). As stated in section 16 of CORE's Order in Council, all parties involved had the opportunity to provide comments on the facts presented in the report. A summary of the received comments can be found in part 5 of the report. \n\nThe complainants, a coalition of 28 Canadian organizations listed in Annex 1, allege that RLCLP has supply relationships with companies that utilize or benefit from forced labor of the Uyghur population. The complaint includes information and reports that mention \"Ralph Lauren,\" but it is unclear whether this refers to the US parent company Ralph Lauren Corporation (RLC), RLCLP, or Ralph Lauren as an international brand or retailer. Nonetheless, the complaint specifically accuses RLCLP of using or benefiting from forced labor in its supply chain. \n\nThe complaint also references bills of lading submitted as evidence, which identify RLCLP as the recipient of shipments from a Chinese company, Esquel Textile Co. Ltd. (Esquel). The Australian Strategic Policy Institute's (ASPI) \"Uyghurs for Sale\" report identifies Esquel, along with Youngor Textile Holdings Co. Ltd. (Youngor) and Jiangsu Guotai Guosheng (Jiangsu), as factories in Ralph Lauren's supply chain where Uyghur workers allegedly labor under conditions suggesting forced labor. \n\nAlthough the complaint implicates all of these companies in connection to Ralph Lauren, it does not explicitly clarify whether Ralph Lauren or RLCLP is specifically involved. However, with regard to Esquel, the complainants provide bills of lading from Import Genius indicating that RLCLP imported twenty-six unique shipments from Esquel to Canada between August 2020 and March 2021. The complainants argue that RLCLP continued to import from Esquel after Ralph Lauren issued a statement on July 30, 2020, denying any sourcing of yarn, textiles, or products from Xinjiang. This statement, titled \"Statement on Xinjiang,\" was released by the US parent company RLC in response to ASPI's \"Uyghurs for Sale\" report, stating that Ralph Lauren does not source any materials from Xinjiang and is actively working with partners and other brands to ensure responsible sourcing practices. \n\nThe complainants argue that the findings of the ASPI report and the bills of lading submitted contradict Ralph Lauren's statement concerning its alleged sourcing practices in Xinjiang, although it is not specified which entity (Ralph Lauren or RLCLP) is being referred to in the complaint."}]}

LPWAN solutions offer enhanced battery efficiency and extended connectivity range compared to traditional mobile networks. However, it's important to note that not all LPWAN technologies are the same. Here is an overview of the available services and key considerations when selecting the right one for your business.\n\nThere are two main categories of LPWAN technologies: unlicensed and licensed. Unlicensed LPWANs utilize proprietary technologies that operate on unlicensed radio spectrum, allowing anyone to use the frequency. These networks are commonly used for transmitting small messages, primarily in urban areas. On the other hand, licensed LPWANs (also known as Mobile IoT by the GSMA) utilize radio spectrum exclusively licensed to specific carriers. These networks follow international standards, enabling seamless and reliable connections across different networks. LTE-M, an example of a licensed LPWAN, provides extensive coverage by leveraging existing LTE infrastructure.\n\nWhen selecting an LPWAN technology, organizations should ensure that it fully supports their IoT goals. Peter Wilcox, Director of IoT and Business Solutions at Bell Canada, suggests considering four key criteria:\n\n1. Coverage: The distribution of your IoT devices plays a crucial role in determining the suitable technology. Consider if your devices are located in a limited or wide area, hard-to-reach locations (e.g., underground), or if they are stationary or mobile. For scenarios with limited coverage needs (e.g., less than 10 kilometers in urban areas) and easily accessible or mobile devices, an unlicensed LPWAN may be a cost-effective option. LTE-M services, on the other hand, are designed to reach devices spread over wide areas or challenging locations like inside buildings or underground. This makes them ideal for monitoring devices below ground, such as water pressure sensors. Industries requiring mobile asset tracking, like transportation, should consider licensed LTE-M services for efficient data transfer from moving vehicles.\n\n2. Security: Data sensitivity is a crucial factor when choosing an LPWAN technology. Organizations need to consider the privacy of transmitted information and its business importance. Unlicensed networks like LoRa offer two layers of security and encryption. However, they utilize shared frequencies, making them susceptible to interference and attacks. For enhanced data security, licensed LTE-M networks ensure message integrity and restrict communication to valid devices, similar to current cellular networks.\n\n3. Reliability: Determine if your IoT solution requires fast or real-time data delivery. Not all applications necessitate high-speed data transfer, in which case, an unlicensed network may suffice. Wilcox notes that unlicensed networks typically experience latency of up to 30 seconds, compared to 50 milliseconds on LTE-M. Therefore, LTE-M is better suited for mission-critical applications or those requiring real-time information delivery. Wilcox explains that \"if a utility needs to make a real-time decision based on sensor information, a licensed network may be a better solution.\"\n\n4. Flexibility: Consider any future requirements for periodic software updates or adaptability to emerging technology trends like 5G. Unlicensed networks rely on proprietary technology and may be suitable for organizations not requiring a high level of flexibility. Licensed networks, being standards-based, are better suited for organizations seeking long-term flexibility. For example, Bell's 5G-ready LTE-M network enables remote software updates, which is not possible on an unlicensed network.\n\nIn conclusion, LPWANs offer exciting opportunities for IoT connectivity. By considering factors such as coverage, security, reliability, and flexibility, organizations can select the most suitable LPWAN technology to support their IoT goals."}]}

The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has released a new energy outlook, projecting that electricity will play a leading role in reshaping the energy mix, along with contributions from hydrogen, bioenergy, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).\n\nThe report, titled \"Canada's Energy Future 2023 Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2050 (EF2023)\", presents three scenarios: global net-zero, Canada net-zero, and current measures. Each scenario differs based on the pace of climate action in Canada and globally, with two scenarios specifically designed to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada by 2050.\n\nIn both net-zero scenarios, electricity will become the most important energy source for Canadians, resulting in a significant decrease in the use of fossil fuels by 2050. This transition will involve replacing current technologies with electricity-powered alternatives, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Emphasizing electricity will also enhance energy efficiency nationwide, leading to a potential decrease in energy usage of up to 22% by 2050.\n\nEmerging technologies and fuels, such as hydrogen, bioenergy, and CCUS, will also play essential roles, particularly in reducing more challenging-to-address emissions. To accommodate the increased demand for electricity, Canada will generate more clean electricity from sources like wind, nuclear, and hydro. Concurrently, fossil fuel electricity generation without CCUS will decline rapidly due to more stringent climate policies.\n\nAmong all technologies, wind is expected to contribute the most to new electricity generation by 2050, increasing over ninefold from current levels in both net-zero scenarios. Overall, the electricity sector is projected to achieve net-zero emissions by 2035 and become net-negative thereafter, thanks to the utilization of bioenergy with CCUS.\n\nThe oil and gas industry will significantly reduce emissions through various technologies during the projection period. However, the pace of global climate action will directly impact global demand and prices for oil and gas in the long run, leading to a decline in production in Canada by 2050. This decline will be most notable in the global net-zero scenario, where efforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5\u00b0C are more widespread. Nonetheless, fossil fuels will still have a significant role in Canada's energy system, particularly in industrial facilities equipped with CCUS or for non-energy purposes like asphalt and petrochemicals.\n\nAchieving net-zero emissions will require significant contributions from all sectors of the economy, with the transportation, electricity, and oil and gas sectors being the most significant contributors to emission reductions. The report acknowledges that several sectors, including buildings, heavy industry, and oil and gas, will still have positive GHG emissions by 2050 in both net-zero scenarios. However, the net-negative emissions from other sectors, including the electricity sector, will offset these positive emissions.\n\nThe CER provides timely, fact-based, and relevant energy analysis to inform the energy conversation in Canada. This long-term outlook on Canadian energy supply and demand covers all energy commodities and Canadian provinces and territories, making projections until 2050 using economic and energy models. It's important to note that the results presented in EF2023 are not predictions or policy recommendations but rather scenarios based on specific premises and assumptions."}]}

Recognizing the desire of enterprise retailers to access this innovative technology, we have made our platform available to some of the largest brands worldwide. In fact, household names such as Glossier, Alo Yoga, Figs, and Staples already rely on Shopify. Earlier this year, we introduced Commerce Components by Shopify, enabling more enterprise retailers to utilize the same powerful Shopify components that drive 10% of e-commerce in the U.S.\n\nBy leveraging Shopify, these retailers stay at the forefront of their industries, harnessing our extensive scale while selecting the components necessary to create exceptional customer experiences. Today, we are proud to unveil our most powerful component yet: Shop Pay Conversion Magic. In response to strong demand from enterprise retailers who have observed the success and scale of the Shop Pay buyer network, we are extending access to our accelerated checkout to the largest brands, even those outside of Shopify.\n\nBy transforming Shop Pay into a commerce component, we empower enterprise customers to enhance their customer experience without the need for a complete overhaul of their commerce infrastructure. For businesses based in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, this means effortless access to a trusted accelerated checkout that serves over 100 million highly committed, high-value buyers. Powered by Shopify Payments, Shop Pay increases conversion rates by up to 50% compared to guest checkouts, surpassing all other accelerated checkouts by at least 10%, according to a recent study conducted by a leading consulting firm. In fact, the data indicates that the mere presence of Shop Pay, even if not utilized by a buyer, leads to a 5% increase in conversion rates.\n\n\"Enterprises that fail to take advantage of Shop Pay are hindering their own success and leaving potential profits untapped,\" stated Kaz Nejatian, Shopify's VP of Product and Chief Operating Officer. \"This is a crucial opportunity in a highly competitive retail environment. In an economy where large brands are fiercely vying for new customers, they need the ability to select and implement tools that enhance their top-line growth without compromising their entire platform.\"\n\nSo, what makes Shop Pay so powerful? We have been able to develop the world's most effective checkout experience due to four key advantages: Shopify's vast identity network, unparalleled scale, consumer trust, and innovation velocity. When a customer with a Shop Pay account visits an online store, Shopify can instantly recognize them with just one click. If they have recently used Shop Pay, our checkout system can identify most customers without any user action. This allows Shop Pay to pre-fill all their information, resulting in a seamless one-click checkout process that is four times faster than a guest checkout.\n\nFurthermore, we understand that enterprise retailers value having a range of payment options. That's why Shopify currently offers over 1,000 payment gateways. Adyen, in particular, has been an integral part of our gateway offerings for many years. However, we are taking our integration with Adyen to the next level specifically for enterprise retailers. Adyen enables businesses to accept a wide variety of payments across global markets, including credit cards, digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, international payment methods such as Ideal in the Netherlands and Cartes Bancaires in France, and more. This enhanced integration is set to launch later this year."}]}

At Shopify, we are proud to have 53% of our global entrepreneurs being women. The idea of women as entrepreneurs was once unthinkable, but now there are over 413 million women entrepreneurs worldwide. Although women still face challenges in raising venture capital and combating wage inequality, data shows that businesses led by women earn more for every dollar invested compared to their male counterparts.\n\nShopify is dedicated to supporting women-led businesses every month, not just now. However, since it's March and we have your attention, we would like to introduce you to three remarkable companies led by women who are determined to inspire change in their respective industries. We will be cheering them on as they make a difference.\n\nSandra Velasquez launched Nopalera in 2020, a beauty brand that celebrates her Mexican culture and aims to create a space for Latin beauty brands. After three years, Nopalera is now available in major retailers such as Credo Beauty, Nordstrom, and Free People. Velasquez had a bold vision to disrupt the historically Euro-centric beauty space and showcase the richness and beauty of her culture. Growing up in California as the daughter of Mexican immigrants, Velasquez's inspiration came from the nopales, or prickly cacti, that she saw in her hometown. After a successful career as a musician and a stint in sales, she took a risk and pursued her dream of becoming an entrepreneur. Velasquez worked three jobs and pursued a degree in organic skincare formulation, using the oil from the nopales to create her products. Today, Nopalera can still be found on her kitchen table and in over 400 boutiques across the U.S. Velasquez's drive comes from wanting to inspire future Latina entrepreneurs and be the first step towards achieving their dreams.\n\nKathryn Shah, inspired by her travels across the Middle East and India, noticed the way other cultures presented fruit, nuts, and dates as luxurious treats. This contrasted with the bulk bins found in the U.S. where these foods were stored. When Shah was diagnosed with breast cancer at 35, she realized the need for healthier indulgences. Instead of receiving boxes of chocolate and cookies, she wanted something delicious, beautiful, and good for you. Shah began experimenting in her kitchen in Raleigh, North Carolina, with her friend Sarah Bell to create the perfect blend of sweetness using natural ingredients. After more than 40 iterations, they developed a chocolate bar that met their high standards, and thus, Spring & Mulberry was born.\n\n"}]}

Even if we were to completely eliminate emissions right now, there is still an excessive amount of carbon in the atmosphere. We understand that no single solution can solve this problem alone. Scaling carbon removal technologies requires significant effort. Since the launch of our sustainability fund in 2019, Shopify has been actively purchasing carbon removal to support the growth of an emerging industry. Today, we are thrilled to announce that we, alongside Stripe, are investing $11 million in carbon removal from six new companies: Arbor, Captura, Carbon to Stone, Cella, Crew, and Inplanet. This is a significant development in our fight against climate change, and we are inspired by the caliber and rate at which new companies are entering the market. Through these purchases, we are enabling these companies to prove their impact and achieve scalability. With the addition of these six new partners, Shopify has now backed a total of 28 companies. These recent purchases are just one aspect of the important work Shopify has undertaken this year to accelerate the carbon removal market. Here is an overview of our 2022 sustainability fund progress: We have added nine new businesses to our portfolio, providing them with the necessary support to bring their vision to the market and increase adoption of their offerings. Through our fund activities, we have helped multiple companies raise over $50 million in capital and expand their workforce by more than five times, resulting in a more than 1000-fold increase in their carbon removal capacity. Frontier: In spring, we launched Frontier, an advance market commitment (AMC), in collaboration with Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability. Together, as founders of Frontier, we have committed to spending a combined $925 million on carbon removal by 2030. This commitment serves as a signal to innovators, investors, and project developers that there is a market for carbon removal, and we must all work together to scale the industry. Shopify Planet: In June, we released Planet, an app that allows Shopify merchants to offset their shipping emissions. Planet calculates the estimated shipping emissions for each order, and merchants can fund carbon removal through the same companies supported by Shopify. Since its launch, over 8,000 Shopify merchants have used Planet to neutralize shipping emissions on more than six million orders, resulting in over 5,000 tonnes of carbon removal. The Planet app is available on the Shopify app store. Buying Carbon Removal, Explained: Recently, we published \"Buying Carbon Removal, Explained,\" a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in supporting carbon removal but facing obstacles along the way. This guide covers everything from researching suppliers to signing carbon removal contracts and navigating discussions with finance teams. We are committed to generating demand for carbon removal, empowering new companies to prove their impact and scale, and investing millions each year to drive down future prices. I had the privilege of speaking more about our efforts at the TED CountDown London session, which you can watch at go.ted.com/stacykauk. That concludes our update for now.

From those first few lines of code to where we are now, it has been a remarkable experience filled with ups and downs, hard work, ambition, and most importantly, teamwork.\n\nToday, however, I have the difficult task of announcing that we will be undergoing a reduction in our workforce. Approximately 10% of our team will be leaving by the end of the day. The roles most affected will be in recruiting, support, and sales. Additionally, we will be eliminating over-specialized and duplicate positions, as well as some groups that were not directly tied to product development.\n\nIn the next few minutes, emails will be sent out to those whose roles have been impacted.

The demand for Shopify skyrocketed, and we worked tirelessly to support our merchants by delivering everything we possibly could.

Before the pandemic, ecommerce growth was steady and predictable. However, we made a bet that the shift to ecommerce would be permanent and accelerate by five to ten years. Unfortunately, it has become evident that this bet did not pay off. The channel mix has reverted to its pre-COVID levels, and although ecommerce is still growing steadily, it did not experience the significant leap we anticipated. This matters because our market share in ecommerce is much higher than in retail.\n\nI take full responsibility for this decision, and I apologize deeply for the consequences it has brought upon some of you. Saying goodbye to members of our team is never easy, and it is with a heavy heart that we must make these adjustments.\n\nTo those who will be leaving Shopify, I want to express my sincere gratitude for your dedication and contribution to our mission of making commerce better for everyone. We understand that this news will impact each of you differently, and we are committed to supporting you through the coming weeks and months. We will be offering a generous severance package, including 16 weeks of severance pay and an additional week for every year of tenure at Shopify. We will also remove any equity cliff and extend any medical benefits.\n\nOnce again, thank you for everything you have done to support our merchants and our shared goals. Please know that we are here for you during this challenging time.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"}]}

In 2021, we introduced Shopify Markets to eliminate barriers to cross-border selling and empower our merchants to expand globally effortlessly. Since then, over 175,000 merchants worldwide have utilized Markets to successfully launch their international businesses. On average, US merchants using Shopify Markets sell their products in 14 other countries. This platform has been a game changer for many, providing transparent and easily understandable data that informs global performance. David Wiggins, Head of Ecommerce at Walk London, stated that utilizing this data has enabled them to make strategic marketing decisions, such as improving shipping services, implementing localized payment methods, and introducing new languages for specific markets. All of these efforts contribute to their growth strategy.\n\nBuilding upon the success of Shopify Markets, we are thrilled to introduce Shopify Markets Pro and Shopify Translate & Adapt. These new enhancements aim to simplify cross-border commerce further, enabling Shopify merchants to accelerate their global expansion without added complexity. Shopify Markets Pro offers a native merchant-of-record solution, powered by our partnership with Global-e. This solution allows Shopify merchants to easily expand their businesses overnight to over 150 countries. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Manages compliance on behalf of the merchant: Compliance with tax and duty regulations varies in every market and can be time-consuming and costly. With Shopify's native merchant-of-record solution, merchants can rely on us to handle these complexities at scale.\n\n2. Accesses affordable express shipping with DHL: Negotiating affordable international shipping rates as an individual merchant can be challenging, especially for express shipping. With Markets Pro, Shopify negotiates competitive rates on behalf of the merchants, providing access to affordable express shipping and prepaid duties.\n\n3. Creates a seamless consumer experience: Each market has unique consumer expectations, and providing a localized and seamless customer experience is crucial for successful international selling. Selling in the local currency and offering preferred payment methods without surprise duty fees on delivery has proven to increase Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) by 7%* from international buyers. Markets Pro simplifies the optimization of the consumer experience by tackling complexities like local currency, payment methods, shipping, and tax and duties at scale.\n\nJake Allain, COO at State & Liberty Clothing Co., expressed his satisfaction with Shopify Markets Pro, stating that it has streamlined and expanded their global expansion strategy while eliminating complexity that typically arises when selling to international consumers.

Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, we remained committed to supporting businesses and facilitating their success. As a result, we achieved significant milestones and experienced substantial growth.\n\nFor the first time in our history, Shopify generated over $1 billion in merchant solutions revenue in a single quarter, specifically in Q4. Just six months prior, we had reached the $1 billion mark for total revenue in a quarter. In total, our revenue for 2021 amounted to $4.6 billion, a remarkable 57% increase compared to the previous year. Furthermore, our merchants achieved tremendous success, selling a total of $175.4 billion on our platform, a 47% increase from 2020. These figures reflect the substantial growth we witnessed as independent businesses flourished and as Shopify solidified its position as the go-to platform for entrepreneurs.\n\nEntrepreneurship itself experienced a surge, as evidenced by a record-breaking 5.4 million new business applications filed in 2021, up from 4.4 million in 2020, according to the US Census Bureau. Additionally, more individuals are choosing to leave traditional employment and pursue their own ventures. Shopify played a crucial role in supporting these entrepreneurs throughout 2021. Now, let's delve into the actions we took to assist them.\n\nOur success and the growth of our merchants were not coincidental. They were the outcome of a global shift toward supporting small businesses, changes in consumer behavior during the pandemic that led to increased online shopping, and Shopify's unwavering commitment to improving commerce for everyone. In 2021, we prioritized empowering merchants to establish their own brands, expand their reach to more buyers, and forge lasting customer relationships. Additionally, we continued building a sustainable internet infrastructure for commerce. This aligns with our mission to level the playing field for entrepreneurs and guide them toward success.\n\nOur efforts extend beyond e-commerce and retail. We aim to enable commerce in every aspect of life, across all geographical locations and platforms. If commerce does not exist in a particular area yet, rest assured it will be soon, and Shopify will be there as well. This core philosophy guided our actions in 2021, and we have even more in store for the future.\n\nLast year, Shopify accomplished the following:\n\n1. We empowered the creator economy by introducing in-app shopping experiences with TikTok. Additionally, we collaborated with Spotify to allow musicians to monetize their fanbase through custom merchandise.\n\n2. We facilitated the growth of our merchants by supporting seven companies on Shopify as they went public. Moreover, we launched our global ERP program in partnership with Microsoft and other industry leaders to assist high-volume merchants in scaling their operations.\n\n3. We expanded our fintech capabilities significantly. Shopify Capital and Balance experienced substantial growth, and we introduced Shop Pay Installments for US buyers. Furthermore, we announced that Shop Pay would be accessible to any business selling on Google or Facebook, regardless of whether they are on the Shopify platform.\n\n4. We enabled cross-border commerce for all merchants through Shopify Markets, simplifying and broadening their access to global markets.\n\n5. Our international expansion continued, with the launch of Shopify POS hardware in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n6. We enhanced the shopping experience from independent businesses through our all-in-one mobile shopping assistant, Shop. We introduced features such as an analytics dashboard, automated marketing tools, in-app cart and checkout with Shop Pay or Installments, and curated discovery filters.\n\nThe common thread among all these initiatives is their objective to drive sales and help merchants reach more customers in various locations. Ultimately, our goal is to hear the satisfying \"cha-ching\" sound that merchants experience with every successful sale on our platform.\n\nThese launches and integrations exemplify our commitment to empowering merchants and facilitating their growth. We look forward to continuing our support and driving commerce forward in the years to come."}]}

More than 25 web properties across eight business units are being updated to follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\n\nIn addition to releasing its accessibility plan, Scotiabank has launched a redesigned accessibility site, www.scotiabank.com/accessibility.

I am extremely honored and privileged to have the opportunity to work alongside our 90,000 Scotiabank employees across our various locations as we strive to create a prosperous future for our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities.

As we move forward, our focus on cultivating a positive company culture, disciplined capital allocation, and operational excellence will guide our strategic agenda in delivering value for our stakeholders. In the Canadian banking sector, earnings for this quarter reached $1,088 million, benefiting from increased margins and significant growth in assets and deposits, particularly in business lending and personal deposits. Results were affected by higher credit loss provisions and increased expenses. International banking recorded adjusted earnings of $661 million, a 20% increase, driven by higher net interest income due to a 19% growth in loans and strong non-interest revenues. This, coupled with effective expense management and lower income taxes, more than offset higher credit loss provisions. Global wealth management reported adjusted earnings of $392 million, a 6% decrease. Challenging market conditions resulted in declines in assets under management, impacting fee income, although there was substantial growth in the advisory business. Prudent expense management offset the decline in revenue, leading to positive operating leverage. Global banking and markets had another strong quarter, with earnings of $519 million. Net interest income saw significant growth of 22% due to a 33% increase in loans. Although advisory revenues were lower, the capital markets business performed well. The bank maintained a strong capital position with an unchanged common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.5%, despite the impact of the Canada Recovery Dividend. With a continued focus on prudent capital management, we anticipate further strengthening of the CET1 ratio throughout the year."}]}

The closure of the access road to Kahului Airport due to the fires resulted in the cancellation of Air Canada's scheduled flight to Vancouver. In response, the System Operations Control (SOC) team immediately formed a dedicated team to address the Maui operation.\n\nThe team meticulously analyzed various factors such as global operations, fleet, and demand requirements, while also considering the ever-changing environment. They evaluated operational constraints, anticipated seat demand from Maui, and strategized how to manage the overall operation during the busy summer travel season amid the crisis. Despite the peak summer season and the unavailability of hotel accommodations for crew rest, Air Canada's diverse fleet presented viable options. By double-crewing a wide-body aircraft with onboard rest facilities, they could bring back twice as many passengers on each flight.\n\nNeale Wisniewski, Director of System Operations Control, emphasized the importance of swiftly returning passengers home given the dire situation. After exploring various alternatives, including technical stops in Honolulu and the use of smaller aircraft, the decision was made to substitute a narrow-body aircraft on one of the Vancouver-Toronto rotations and assign a wide-body aircraft for immediate service in Maui over three days. The plan, involving cross-functional teams across the airline, was finalized and implemented within 24 hours.\n\nEffective coordination between various operational branches, encompassing crew scheduling, contract centers, catering, security, and ground handling, was critical to ensuring smooth operations. Additional fuel was loaded in case the Maui facilities were compromised, extra pilots were assigned for maximum flexibility, and a maintenance engineer accompanied the crew to sign off on the aircraft in Maui.\n\nAs per the request of local authorities, Air Canada canceled outbound flights to Maui and operated a ferry flight without passengers. These flights then returned as scheduled flights on a wide-body aircraft to maximize passenger capacity.\n\nKaren Park, Air Canada's Manager for Customer Service in Hawaii, played an integral role in liaising with local authorities, other airlines, the ground handling team, and the SOC team while assisting passengers in this dynamic and evolving situation. Despite challenges such as limited communication and restricted access to the airport, Air Canada managed to navigate through the largest natural disaster in the state's history to ensure the safe return of its passengers."}]}

The Minister requested that the ombudsperson examine these concerns, engage with other registered charities led by racialized communities to understand their experiences with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and clarify the CRA's role in national security.\n\nThe examination focused on three main issues: 1) the selection of files for audit by the Review and Analysis Division (RAD) of the CRA's Charities Directorate, 2) the quality of services offered to charities under audit by the RAD, and 3) the CRA's efforts to address potential unconscious biases that could lead to discriminatory behavior towards charities run by racialized communities. Throughout this process, our office maintained its commitment to independence, carefully considering all perspectives, gathering factual information, and identifying areas where the CRA can improve its service to Canadians.\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive examination, we consulted a wide range of stakeholders, including charities, non-profits, experts on bias, lawyers from the Department of Justice Canada, CRA employees and executives, and academics. Despite facing some legislative and administrative obstacles that hindered us from obtaining all the necessary information, we believe this report still highlights opportunities for the CRA to enhance its service to charities.\n\nWhile we were unable to conduct a full examination, we did identify one crucial area for improvement. Recognizing the impact of bias, the taxpayers' ombudsperson recommends that the CRA: 1) develop an unconscious bias training course specifically for employees within the Charities Directorate, 2) target this course at individuals involved in the audit process, and 3) make the course mandatory for all employees participating in the audit process, including decision-makers.\n\nTo provide some background, the Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson operates independently from the CRA. Canadians can submit complaints to our office if they believe they are not receiving appropriate service from the CRA. Our primary objective is to enhance the service provided by the CRA to taxpayers and benefit recipients by addressing individual service complaints and systemic issues affecting multiple individuals or segments of the population. We also assist, advise, and inform the Minister of National Revenue on matters related to CRA services, ensuring that the CRA upholds eight of the service rights outlined in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\n\nFor further information on our ongoing examinations, please visit our website at [insert website link]."}]}

However, on this particular occasion, the official seemed reluctant to see me. I noticed that smoke was coming from his desk, even though smoking had been prohibited in enclosed offices for civil servants by the provincial government a few months earlier. When he saw an investigator from the ombudsman's office approaching, he quickly hid his ashtray and cigarette in his drawer. We both found the situation amusing when he was caught. I was relieved that our working relationship remained intact.\n\nAs an investigator for the Alberta Ombudsman, it was crucial for me to receive professional respect, as it played a significant role in fulfilling the ombudsman's mandate of promoting fair treatment in the public sector. As an independent officer of the legislative assembly, my responsibilities involved investigating complaints of unfair treatment within the delivery of public services. During that time, senior civil servants were predominantly male, and female investigators, like myself, were scarce. The most common new hire was typically a 50-plus-year-old former policeman. Despite being hired at the age of 34, one of my colleagues warned me that I was too young for the job. The reason behind the preference for older investigators was the need for them to be perceived as experienced and credible when dealing with a civil service that operated with limited regulations.\n\nBack then, as in the present, the government required a legislative and policy framework to function, but there was a general sense of flexibility and pragmatism. Many individuals opposed structured processes, as they viewed policies as restrictive. Fortunately, we have all progressed since then.\n\nIn the 1990s, I conducted interviews with two civil servants and found their decisions, based solely on \"common sense,\" to be unfair. I inquired about the existence of policies and they consulted with a superior before reassuring me that the department indeed had policies. I requested to review these policies, but they had to consult with their superior once again, as the policy book was in Calgary. At the time, basic concepts seemed to elude many individuals. For instance, one regional manager in the social-assistance field had a condescending sign on his wall stating, \"In this office, 'no' is a complete sentence.\" Looking back from 2022, I am ashamed to admit that I did not object. I recognized that the poster conveyed the wrong message to both staff and clients, but I lacked the conscious awareness of fairness principles that would have provided me with the vocabulary to express my objection. \n\nAfter working for 36 years to promote administrative fairness, I can confidently state that all decisions are subject to review and \"no\" can never be considered a complete sentence. The importance of explaining the reasoning behind a decision, based on the facts of the case in relation to legislation and policy, becomes increasingly crucial as the significance of the decision grows. Even formally appointed boards, consisting of experts, can overlook the necessity of providing fair reasons. A typical decision might conclude with \"based on the evidence above, the benefit is denied.\" However, it fails to specify which evidence was considered important and why, leaving readers to make assumptions. Fortunately, improvements have been made. Hiring practices now prioritize inclusivity, and the creation and adherence to policies are recognized as essential practices. In this era of open government, many policies are readily available online. New hires receive proper training instead of being thrown into the fire to learn as they go.\n\nThe advancement of technology, particularly in the last 15 years, has been inevitable. Some decisions that used to take days or weeks can now be made instantaneously. Although automation may appear practical and convenient, it must be balanced with the challenges it presents. Computer programs are not comprehensive and lack the ability to exercise discretion. Consequently, it has become more difficult than ever for Albertans to receive personal advice and have their cases reviewed when they are denied service. Template computer responses are often insufficient in addressing individual circumstances."}]}

We believe that respect and inclusion are fundamental pillars of our culture, and we strive to provide equal access and opportunities for learning, growth, success, and well-being to everyone. \n\nIn early 2021, P&G Canada introduced our Equality & Inclusion Action Plan, with the objective of reflecting the diversity of Canada at all levels of our organization. By 2025, we aim to increase representation of Indigenous, Black, and French individuals within our workforce. Currently, despite Indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis) constituting almost 5% of the Canadian population, none of our employees identify as Indigenous, and none of our eight employee affinity groups specifically represent them. \n\nIn May 2021, we established the Indigenous Professional Network (IPN) as a new addition to our Canadian Equality & Inclusion Action Plan. The mission of IPN is to assist P&G in fulfilling the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Call to Action #92, which urges companies to support Indigenous peoples through fostering respectful relationships, promoting economic opportunities, increasing representation, and fostering an inclusive workplace. \n\nTo date, our actions have focused on three key areas: community engagement, employee awareness, and recruiting. \n\nIn terms of community engagement, we have partnered with Indigenous Works, a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing Indigenous involvement in the Canadian economy. As a member of their Leadership Circle for Indigenous Inclusion, they have been instrumental in assisting us in the development of our employment and inclusion strategies. Additionally, we have donated $100,000 to GlobalMedic, our longstanding partner, to distribute P&G hygiene kits to Indigenous communities across Canada that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Furthermore, we have supported the United for Change Indigenous People's Solidarity Fund with a corporate match of $200,000. This fund has raised over $1 million to date and benefits over 40 Indigenous-led charities throughout Canada, spanning a range of social services to arts and culture initiatives. \n\nIn terms of employee awareness, we have organized various events and initiatives. For example, in June 2021, we held our first nationwide speaker event on National Indigenous Peoples Day, featuring Dr. Lana Potts, a member of the Piikani Nation and an advocate for Indigenous health. Furthermore, on the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation in September 2021, we organized a film screening of \"We Were Children,\" followed by discussion breakouts. The goal was to educate employees about the intergenerational harm caused by the legacy of the residential school system. In December 2021, we published a list of Indigenous-owned charities and organizations, providing employees with options to purchase gifts or donate their time and money. In March 2022, we conducted a reflective session based on the book \"21 Things You May Not Know About the Indian Act,\" allowing employees to gain insights into how Canadian law affects Indigenous peoples and empowering them to take concrete actions to support Indigenous communities. These employee events and discussions have been highly attended, with over 150 Canadian employees participating. \n\nIn terms of recruiting, we have launched the Indigenous Student Internship program nationwide, partnering with over seven campuses to raise awareness and encourage applications. This initiative has resulted in the recruitment of two Indigenous interns, a first for P&G Canada. Additionally, we have established a partnership with the University of British Columbia to obtain consultation on job postings and develop a go-to-campus strategy. Furthermore, we were the spotlight session sponsor for Indspire's \"Soaring Indigenous Youth Empowerment Gathering,\" reaching over 900 high school students and teachers across Canada. \n\nAt P&G Canada, we are committed to driving meaningful change and creating a more inclusive and diverse workplace. Through our Equality & Inclusion Action Plan and initiatives such as the Indigenous Professional Network, we are dedicated to advancing Indigenous representation, fostering respectful relationships, and supporting Indigenous communities."}]}

Working together with our partners, we aim to improve, manage, and protect water resources in stressed areas, ensuring the sustainability of both people and nature for future generations.\n\nTo highlight the significance of our commitment, we have set a groundbreaking goal to restore more water than is consumed when using our products in critically water-stressed metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Mexico City. Through measures like reducing water use in manufacturing, fostering innovation and partnerships to tackle water challenges, and supporting projects in 18 water-stressed regions globally, we strive to create a water-positive future.\n\nIn line with our comprehensive program, we have added two new goals. These goals focus on addressing water that does not return to local systems from our operations and, for the first time in our industry, from consumer product use. To ensure the credibility of these goals, we have collaborated closely with the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Program, aligning our targets with scientific research and emerging best practices in target-setting.\n\nOur commitment extends to implementing new projects that have a significant impact on water-stressed communities. Today, we are pleased to announce six restoration projects in the Bear River Basin, Utah, and Idaho. These projects, in collaboration with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation's Business for Water Stewardship, aim to restore natural habitats, enhance water quality, preserve cultural heritage, and improve irrigation efficiency for local communities and wetland habitats in the Western United States. These efforts supplement the eight projects we began supporting in 2020 in California's Sacramento River Basin and the Colorado River Indian Tribes System Conservation Project in Arizona, which seek to mitigate declining water levels in Lake Mead. By 2030, these projects are expected to restore billions of liters of water for people and nature while providing additional benefits to surrounding communities.\n\nIn the years to come, we will continue working with both new and existing partners to support diverse, long-term projects in other water-stressed regions worldwide.

Additionally, the brand will plant 50,000 native trees in British Columbia to restore forests, support biodiversity, and create positive social impact globally.\n- Tide is revolutionizing laundry practices to reduce carbon emissions at every stage, from design to consumer use and end of life. Canadians are being educated on the benefits of cold water washing. Moreover, for every Tide Pods purchase at Walmart Canada in April 2022, 50 cents will be donated to WWF-Canada to support nature-based solutions to combat climate change.\n- Cascade is committed to educating Canadians about the water and energy savings achieved by running the dishwasher even when it's only half-full, compared to handwashing. As part of Cascade's dedication to protect and conserve nature for future generations, for every Cascade purchase at Walmart Canada in April 2022, 50 cents will be donated to Earth Rangers, a children's conservation organization.\n\n5. P&G Good Everyday: For every new sign-up until May 31, 2022, we will plant one tree in Canada's wildfire-devastated areas, promoting reforestation efforts.\n\n6. Our \"It's Our Home\" campaign emphasizes the impact of small actions at home on the environment and encourages individuals to make a difference for our planet.\n\nAt P&G, we are enthusiastic about these initiatives and are committed to being a force for good and growth by integrating environmental sustainability into all aspects of our business."}]}

Factors such as uneven inflation, higher rates, and recession risks are putting portfolios to the test. At the same time, disruptive megatrends like artificial intelligence and the complexities of sustainability are transforming industries and economies. Changes in trade patterns, geopolitical shifts, and demographic trends are also reshaping our world. As dislocation in all areas intensifies, finding the right balance between risk and reward will be challenging.\n\nWe believe it is essential for investors to cut through the noise and understand the nuances of recent economic events in order to manage the consequences on their investment portfolios. While embracing change may lead to new opportunities, the risks of being left behind are greater. Companies are reshaping themselves to compete in this challenging macro environment, creating investment opportunities in public and private credit, private secondaries, private equity, private infrastructure, green and social bonds, and thematic equities.\n\nAdaptable active strategies that seek differentiated exposures across public and private markets can make portfolios more resilient and potentially deliver alpha in this era of rapid change. Success in today's dynamic market environment will require agility, as well as the right technology, data, and networks to achieve exponential results. Creativity and courage are needed to look beyond conventions, but deep experience gained through previous market cycles is also valuable.\n\nIn private equity, the path to operational value creation may look different than in the past, and general partners (GPs) may need to maintain an edge as limited partners (LPs) focus more on manager due diligence. Commercial real estate is also being reshaped by macro forces and secular trends, creating gaps between buildings that adapt to disruption and those that become obsolete.\n\nThe advancements in generative AI have provided a disruptive force and generated considerable investor enthusiasm. The ability to synthesize unstructured data, recognize patterns, and produce intelligible output has real applications for businesses and could potentially counter higher inflation. However, it is important for investors to consider the far-reaching implications that AI could have on the business landscape and global power dynamics.\n\nAs the AI story unfolds, the transition towards a sustainable and inclusive economy continues to transform industries. Decarbonization-related themes and investment approaches are becoming increasingly complex, prompting debates on achieving long-term, affordable, clean, and secure energy. Investors may need a more sophisticated approach to managing climate-related risks.\n\nFinally, achieving inclusive growth and improving quality of life is a complex challenge. A comprehensive approach across healthcare, education, financial inclusion, and community development is required to drive solutions. We are excited to leverage the insights of our experienced investment professionals to help you navigate this remarkable phase of change. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with you."}]}

However, just two months after its release in November 2022 by OpenAI, ChatGPT quickly gained popularity, reaching an estimated 100 million monthly active users by January 2023. This remarkable growth has sparked a rush of interest from application developers, venture capital-backed startups, and major corporations, all eager to explore the potential of generative AI tools.\n\nWhile many hedge fund managers have also integrated AI into their processes, their primary focus is on capitalizing on what is seen as a new and more volatile market environment. As of July 2023, the US Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate in 11 out of the last 12 meetings, including four consecutive 0.75% hikes. This aggressive pace of rate increases, the fastest since the early 1980s, has led to a significant shift in the economic landscape.\n\nWith the federal funds rate rising by approximately 500 basis points in just 16 months (from March 2022 to July 2023), hedge fund managers may be experiencing a similar evolution in their investment strategies. The new macroeconomic environment, characterized by higher volatility, is generally advantageous for most hedge fund strategies. Therefore, we anticipate that it will lead to significantly improved expected returns over the medium term, with comparable or potentially lower levels of risk.\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the market environment was characterized by low inflation, meager economic growth, and accommodative global monetary and fiscal policies. This led to a period of reduced volatility across most asset classes due to easy money and ultra-low interest rates. However, since early 2022, there has been a notable increase in inflation, prompting central banks to tighten monetary policies and raise interest rates. As a result, volatility has returned to most asset classes.\n\nAlthough rates and volatility are higher now compared to the decade following the global financial crisis, they remain within reasonable levels when considering longer timeframes. Furthermore, despite concerns about a potential recession due to the shift towards tighter monetary and fiscal policies, the job market and risk asset performance have remained robust. However, there is a consensus in the market for an extended period of elevated macro volatility.\n\nFor much of the past decade, the hedge fund industry faced challenges in generating alpha due to subdued volatility and a near-zero interest rate environment. However, the tightening of monetary policies has ushered in a new macro regime characterized by higher volatility, which presents more favorable investing opportunities for hedge funds. Historical data shows that when equity and fixed income volatility increases, hedge fund alpha generation also improves, as seen in the second half of 2022.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, hedge fund alpha generation was around 5%, similar to the average fed funds rate during that period. Hedge fund strategies continued to perform well during the depths of the global financial crisis and immediately after, as agile and opportunistic investors capitalized on market dislocations worldwide. However, the subsequent long period of low rates and low volatility limited profitable opportunities for hedged investors, as securities traded in sync and asset class dispersion remained low.\n\nIn summary, the recent increase in volatility and shifting market dynamics present a more favorable environment for hedge fund strategies to generate alpha. As equity and bond markets respond to monetary policy and volatility levels rise, opportunities for nimble investors to profit from market uncertainty become more abundant."}]}

These humanized experiences occur at every touchpoint of the insured's journey through the insurance lifecycle.\n\nFor example, The Hartford has created an intuitive website that makes it quick and easy for AARP members to obtain a quote and purchase auto and home insurance. However, humanized experiences are not limited to pre-bind activities. They should also occur during the moment of truth in delivering on the promise of insurance. Lemonade, for instance, utilizes AI to process claims in a record-breaking time of 2 seconds.\n\nEach insurer will have its own unique approach to creating humanized experiences based on its business objectives. However, I believe that having the right technology stack in place is crucial to achieving humanized experiences. In this post, we will explore how continuous updates in SaaS core systems can enable insurers to define the humanized experiences of the future more effectively than periodic upgrades.\n\nPeriodic upgrades have long been known as a barrier to innovation in the industry. In a survey conducted by Duck Creek in 2020, over 53% of global insurers reported upgrading their IT systems only once every 2-3 years. Meanwhile, core systems have evolved from legacy mainframes to \"evergreen\" SaaS solutions that are always up-to-date and adaptable to changing business requirements.\n\nInitial SaaS core systems have improved operational efficiency for insurers by providing upgrades more quickly. However, insurers have had to wait a long time for these upgrades, which has not always been ideal for designing humanized experiences. The good news is that SaaS core systems are continuing to evolve and become even more evergreen. The paradigm is shifting from faster upgrades to no more upgrades, with insurers benefiting from continuous updates that include new features, issue resolutions, and security patches.\n\nAt Duck Creek, we refer to our approach of delivering software as \"active delivery.\" For example, with Duck Creek Claims, we have delivered over 250 new features on a bi-weekly basis (over 80 software builds) in the past two years while ensuring flexible adoption for insurers through feature flags."}]}

Perhaps you have upgraded to a more luxurious and comfortable option, leaving your old mattress neglected in a corner. Or maybe you are moving and unable to take your mattress with you. Whatever the reason, it may initially seem obvious to dispose of your old mattress. However, it is important to note that mattresses are among the most challenging items to properly dispose of. Fortunately, as experts in junk removal, we are here to assist you and address any inquiries you may have. In the following paragraphs, we will delve into the significance of recycling your old mattress and the associated benefits.\n\nDid you know that mattresses consume a significant amount of space in landfills? In fact, they rank among the largest items, with the average mattress occupying up to 40 cubic feet of space. Considering the millions of mattresses discarded annually, it is crucial for us to find ways to recycle them and prevent them from ending up in landfills. By recycling your mattress, you not only alleviate landfill overcrowding but also save on transportation and disposal costs. It is worth noting that mattresses take anywhere from 80 to 120 years to decompose, meaning that a mattress discarded today will continue to impact future generations.\n\nFurthermore, certain materials utilized in mattress production can be toxic and contribute to soil and groundwater pollution, causing lasting harm to the environment. Mattresses consist of various materials, including foam, cotton, and synthetic fabrics. Over time, these materials break down and release toxins into the environment. When mattresses decompose in landfills, these toxins can seep into the ground, ultimately contaminating soil and water. By recycling and upcycling mattress materials, we can prevent the release of these toxins and minimize the risk of contamination.\n\nWhile recycling your old mattress may initially appear as an unnecessary expense, it can actually be a cost-effective decision in the long run. Discarding a mattress in a dump often incurs a fee, and some cities even impose fines on residents who leave their mattresses for curbside pickup. Conversely, many recycling centers accept mattresses free of charge or for a nominal fee. Additionally, when mattresses are recycled, their materials can be repurposed into new products, resulting in resource and energy conservation.\n\nThe good news is that mattresses can indeed be recycled! In fact, over 80% of mattress materials are recyclable, meaning very little goes to waste. For instance, the foam in a mattress can be broken down into small pieces and used in the production of new furniture or home insulation. The metal springs from a mattress can be melted down and transformed into other items, such as car parts or even jewelry. The wooden frames can be repurposed as firewood or shredded to create landscaping mulch. Moreover, fabrics from old mattresses can be shredded and utilized as stuffing for pillows or blankets. By opting to recycle your mattress, you not only divert waste from landfills but also contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nThe mattress recycling industry is experiencing growth, resulting in an increasing number of job opportunities for individuals seeking employment. Recycling mattresses requires skilled workers who can disassemble and sort the materials. Recycling centers typically employ individuals who dismantle old mattresses and separate reusable materials for resale or donation. The expansion of mattress recycling facilities means that there will be a higher demand for workers with these specific skills, which is promising for the economy."}]}

Smoking is a widespread addictive behavior and a leading cause of adult mortality. A recent study conducted by a team of scientists from the Universities of Cambridge and Warwick in the UK, along with Fudan University in China, examined brain imaging and behavioral data from over 800 young individuals at the ages of 14, 19, and 23.\n\nThe researchers found that teenagers who began smoking at the age of 14 showed a significant decrease in grey matter in a specific part of the left frontal lobe associated with decision-making and rule-breaking. Grey matter is responsible for processing information and housing the brain's neurons. While brain development continues into adulthood, grey matter growth reaches its peak before adolescence. The decrease in grey matter volume in the left side of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex could potentially serve as an \"inheritable biomarker\" for nicotine addiction, with implications for prevention and treatment.\n\nFurthermore, the scientists observed that the right part of the same brain region also had less grey matter in smokers. Notably, the loss of grey matter in the right prefrontal cortex accelerated only after individuals started smoking. This region is associated with sensation-seeking behavior. The team suggests that reduced grey matter in the left forebrain could impair cognitive function and lead to impulsive, rule-breaking behavior due to a limited ability to consider consequences. This, in turn, may increase the likelihood of smoking at a young age. Once nicotine addiction takes hold, grey matter in the right frontal lobe diminishes, potentially weakening control over smoking by affecting hedonic motivation, the way in which pleasure is sought and managed. Excessive loss of grey matter in the right brain was also associated with binge drinking and marijuana use.\n\nThe findings from this study indicate a damaged neurobehavioral mechanism that can contribute to early nicotine use and long-term addiction. The research utilized data from the Imagen project and has been published in the journal Nature Communications. \"Smoking is perhaps the most common addictive behavior globally and a leading cause of adult mortality,\" stated Professor Trevor Robbins, co-senior author from Cambridge's Department of Psychology. It is estimated that annually, cigarette-related deaths will reach eight million worldwide by the end of the decade. In the US alone, smoking is attributed to one in five adult deaths each year.\n\n\"In our study, reduced grey matter in the left prefrontal cortex was associated with increased rule-breaking behavior and early smoking experiences. It is possible that this rule-breaking leads to the violation of anti-smoking norms,\" explained Professor Robbins. Co-author Professor Barbara Sahakian from Cambridge's Department of Psychiatry added, \"The ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in dopamine, the brain's pleasure chemical. In addition to its role in rewarding experiences, dopamine has long been believed to influence self-control. Less grey matter across this brain region may limit cognitive function, leading to lower self-control and a propensity for risky behavior such as smoking.\"\n\nThe study utilized data collected by the Imagen project from sites in the UK, Germany, France, and Ireland. The researchers compared brain imaging data between individuals who had started smoking by the age of 14 and those who had not. This comparison was repeated for the same participants at ages 19 and 23. Those who had started smoking by the age of 14 exhibited significantly less grey matter in the left prefrontal cortex, on average. Additionally, individuals who began smoking by age 19 also showed less grey matter in their left prefrontal cortex at age 14, suggesting a potential causal influence."}]}

While scientists have previously relied on distant galaxies to study dark energy, direct detection has remained elusive. However, the Cambridge researchers have found that by analyzing the movement of Andromeda and the Milky Way towards each other based on their collective mass, they can establish an upper limit on the cosmological constant, the simplest model of dark energy. The upper limit they found is five times higher than the value detectable from the early universe. Although the technique is still in its early stages, the researchers believe it holds promise for detecting dark energy in our own cosmic neighborhood. The findings have been reported in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nDark energy, which accounts for 68% of the universe, is a mysterious force that pushes objects apart, while dark matter, making up 27% of the universe, holds objects together. The cosmological constant is a constant energy density that was added to Einstein's theory of general relativity to explain dark energy. Initially set at zero, it was later discovered that an unknown force, dark energy, was responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, there are two major challenges with dark energy: its exact nature remains unknown and direct detection has not been achieved. Astronomers have devised various methods to detect dark energy, primarily by studying objects from the early universe and measuring their rate of movement away from us. However, due to the weak force of dark energy between galaxies, unpacking its effects from billions of years ago is difficult, as it is easily overshadowed by stronger forces within galaxies.\n\nThe Andromeda galaxy presents a unique opportunity to study dark energy, as it is the only galaxy moving towards us. As Andromeda and the Milky Way gradually approach each other, they will eventually start orbiting each other, albeit very slowly, with a single orbit taking 20 billion years. However, due to their massive gravitational forces, their merger will begin about five billion years from now, far before a complete orbit is completed. By studying the mass and movement of Andromeda, which is not receding from us like other galaxies, researchers can gain insights into the cosmological constant and dark energy. Dr. David Benisty, the lead author of the study, explains that Andromeda's proximity and unique characteristics make it a valuable tool for understanding dark energy. The simulations conducted by Benisty and his colleagues, Professor Anne Davis and Professor Wyn Evans, indicate that dark energy does indeed influence the orbital dynamics of Andromeda and the Milky Way."}]}

This type of devastation is becoming more frequent in the South Pacific due to rising temperatures that fuel intense tropical storms. Vanuatu is at the forefront of the battle against nature's forces. The combination of coastal erosion and extreme weather poses threats to lives and futures throughout this archipelago, which sits at a low elevation. Settlements that accommodate over a quarter of the population face the possibility of sinking into the ocean within a few decades due to rising sea levels caused by global warming. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau of Vanuatu expressed a sense of urgency, stating that his country has run out of time, as the effects of global warming have now become an existential crisis for Vanuatu.\n\nIt is deeply unfair that wealthy nations continue to release excessive carbon emissions into the atmosphere, while Vanuatu contributes almost nothing. Despite being a developing country, Vanuatu is on the brink of becoming a victim of the climate crisis. Is this a just situation? According to Jorge Vi\u00f1uales, the Harold Samuel Professor of Law and Environmental Policy at Cambridge, emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases, knowing the harm it will cause worldwide, cannot be considered lawful. Treaties like the Paris Agreement are intentionally left open to interpretation, but when examining international law more broadly, such as human rights or the law of the sea, it becomes evident that nations contributing to climate change are acting unlawfully. Although this has not been formally stated before, Vi\u00f1uales, an experienced practitioner from Cambridge's Department of Land Economy, has been assisting Vanuatu from the beginning with strategic and legal aspects of their request to the United Nations General Assembly for an \"advisory opinion\" on climate change from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court. The ICJ has provided opinions on a wide range of topics, from genocide to nuclear disarmament, but it has yet to address what may be the defining issue of the 21st century.\n\nNearly four years ago, Vi\u00f1uales received an email from a group of 27 final-year law students at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. What started as a class project quickly gained momentum. The students managed to secure the support of the Vanuatu government, and a small Pacific law firm based in Guam took on the case. Solomon Yeo, the student campaign leader who hails from the climate-threatened Solomon Islands, recognizes the privilege of using his legal knowledge and skills to fight for a dignified life for his people. Vi\u00f1uales notes that any attempt to bring climate change to the ICJ would only succeed if it was well-founded, which he found encouraging. He vividly remembers cycling from his flat to the Lauterpacht Centre in Cambridge, with the fundamental elements of the draft question taking shape in his mind during the Christmas holidays of 2019.\n\nEfforts to bring global warming to the ICJ have been made by lawyers, academics, and climate-threatened Pacific nations for decades, including previous attempts by Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Maldives in 2002, and Palau in 2012. However, limited resources and lack of grassroots and diplomatic support hindered these endeavors. Nevertheless, it is now time to try again, especially since circumstances have changed. People are witnessing the tangible effects of climate change, leading to mounting frustration as annual climate conferences come and go, accompanied by increasingly dire warnings, while major polluting nations hesitate and delay. The fact that an oil executive will preside over COP28 raises doubts among the public. How can they be expected to accept that? Since around 2015, there has been a surge in climate litigation, in which courts are being called upon to address the political inaction we are currently facing. According to the UN Charter, a simple majority of member states must vote in favor of a resolution to present a case before the ICJ, located in The Hague, Netherlands."}]}

This led him to question how individuals could come to support the ideologies of figures like Adolf Hitler, and how they could be educated to resist such influence.\n\nDuring his graduate studies in psychology in the mid-2010s, this psychologist, van der Linden, came across the work of American researcher William McGuire. McGuire had developed a theory in the 1960s on preventing indoctrination, inspired by stories of brainwashed prisoners-of-war during the Korean War. He wondered whether exposing individuals to a milder form of propaganda could equip them to resist a full-scale attack if they were to be captured. Just as military drills prepared soldiers for combat, a preliminary exposure to an assault on their beliefs could prepare them against mental manipulation. McGuire argued that this could serve as a cognitive immunization against propaganda, a kind of vaccine against brainwashing.\n\nLike traditional vaccines that provide weaker doses of pathogens to prepare our immune system, a psychological vaccine would involve exposing the brain to a milder form of misinformation. This would help the \"mental antibodies\" recognize and defend against the full-fledged version when encountered again. Van der Linden aimed to build upon McGuire's theories and test the concept of psychological inoculation in real-world scenarios.\n\nHis initial study focused on combating climate change misinformation. At the time, a false petition circulated on Facebook, claiming insufficient scientific evidence for human-made global warming and featuring fake signatures from supposed American scientists, including Geri Halliwell and the cast of M*A*S*H. Van der Linden and his team informed participants of politically motivated actors attempting to deceive them\u2014the fake petition in this case\u2014and subsequently presented a thorough debunking of its claims, highlighting the inclusion of Halliwell and others. When participants later encountered the petition, they were aware not to believe it.\n\nThe approach hinges on the idea that debunking and fact-checking lose their effectiveness once individuals have already been exposed to misinformation. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare people in advance, a concept van der Linden refers to as \"prebunking.\" Prevention is more valuable than a cure. When van der Linden published his findings in 2016, he did not anticipate that his work would gain extraordinary attention during an era marked by Donald Trump's election, the prevalence of fake news, and a post-truth environment. Media and governments were eager to understand how this methodology could be scaled up.\n\nVan der Linden collaborated with game developers to create an online game called \"Bad News,\" resembling a choose-your-own-adventure format. Through this game, players could practice writing and spreading misinformation. Like a comprehensive vaccine, exposing people to the tactics used in disseminating fake news strengthens their ability to detect falsehoods. However, social media companies remained reluctant to actively combat misinformation, as it did not align with their primary business model of being content moderators and truth arbiters.\n\nThen, a mysterious flu-like illness began afflicting people in China, and the ensuing coronavirus pandemic escalated the threat of misinformation to unprecedented levels. Van der Linden started working with the British government, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations to create an adapted version of the game, specifically tailored to COVID-19. This project, called \"GoViral!,\" aimed to combat misinformation surrounding the pandemic. Additional versions were developed, including one for the 2020 US presidential election and another addressing extremist recruitment in the Middle East. Gradually, Silicon Valley began recognizing the significance of this work."}]}

Mindfulness in these courses is defined as the awareness that arises through purposeful attention in the present moment, without judgment. These courses, known as mindfulness-based programs (MBPs), combine meditation, body awareness, and modern psychology techniques. They are designed to reduce stress, improve well-being, and enhance mental and emotional resilience. The courses consist of group sessions led by mindfulness teachers, who encourage reflection and sharing over several one-to-two-hour sessions.\n\nPrevious research on the effectiveness of MBPs has produced mixed results. Therefore, the Cambridge researchers aimed to determine the impact of MBPs on psychological distress, which includes symptoms of anxiety and depression. They analyzed data from 2,371 adults who had participated in trials assessing the effectiveness of MBPs. Roughly half of the participants were randomly assigned to attend mindfulness programs lasting eight weeks, with one to two-and-a-half-hour sessions per week. The researchers compared their results to those who did not attend an MBP, using self-reported questionnaires. The study revealed that MBPs led to a small to moderate reduction in psychological distress among adults. 13% more participants experienced a benefit compared to those who did not attend an MBP. The researchers also found that factors such as existing psychological distress, age, gender, educational level, and disposition towards mindfulness did not influence the effectiveness of MBPs.\n\nDr. Galante emphasized that choosing to participate in an in-person mindfulness course with a teacher in a group setting can be beneficial for reducing psychological distress and improving mental health. However, she noted that not everyone may benefit from these courses, and they should not be seen as a universal solution. She also acknowledged that other activities, such as joining a football club, may provide similar benefits. The researchers conducted a systematic review to select previous studies for their analysis and obtained complete but anonymized data from 13 trials conducted in eight countries. The median age of the participants was 34 years, and 71% of them were women.\n\nWhile mindfulness apps are becoming more popular, researchers are uncertain whether it is the practice of mindfulness itself or the in-person group work with a teacher that reduces psychological distress. Dr. Galante emphasized that there is not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of apps compared to in-person courses. Nevertheless, she plans to investigate the effectiveness of smartphone apps and the impact of individual meditation practice in future studies.\n\nDr. Galante has recently taken on a new position as the Deputy Director of the Contemplative Studies Centre at the University of Melbourne."}]}

Dame Theresa Marteau, a renowned public health expert from the University of Cambridge, asserts that neglecting evidence is a sure path to unsuccessful policymaking. In an article published in the journal Science and Public Policy, Professor Marteau highlights two factors contributing to this \"evidence-neglect\": incentive structures that prioritize ambitious policy goals while discouraging their implementation, and conflicting political ideologies and interests. To mitigate these challenges, she recommends increased citizen engagement in policy-making to prioritize their interests and the establishment of legally binding systems to hold politicians accountable throughout the policy-making process.\n\nDespite the UK government setting ambitious objectives to improve national health and combat climate change, including targets to halve childhood obesity by 2030, eradicate smoking by 2030, narrow the gap in healthy life expectancy by 2030, and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, Professor Marteau argues that none of these aspirations are currently on track. Scientific evidence, while just one source of information for policymakers, is crucial and its neglect undermines the effectiveness of policymaking. Forecasts indicate that childhood obesity is projected to double by 2030 instead of halving, smoking eradication is expected to occur after 2050 rather than by 2030, the gap in healthy life expectancy between different regions will narrow by 2030 but then increase by five years by 2035, and the UK is likely to miss its crucial carbon emissions target by a significant margin.\n\nAchieving these goals necessitates sustained changes in various behaviors across all socio-economic groups, encompassing dietary choices, smoking habits, and transportation. Extensive research confirms the challenge of inducing such change, requiring multiple interventions to modify environments and systems that perpetuate unhealthy and unsustainable behaviors. Professor Marteau declares, \"The neglect of evidence, particularly regarding sustained behavior change in populations, is a significant reason why these policy ambitions remain so distant. The policies designed to achieve these goals are fundamentally flawed and incapable of producing the necessary outcomes.\"\n\nOne contributing factor to this issue lies in the incentive structures for politicians, which prioritize the establishment of ambitious policy objectives to fulfill election promises and garner positive publicity, while simultaneously discouraging the adoption of necessary policies to attain these goals. Fear of electoral damage also plays a role, as politically unfavorable measures such as taxes on tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy food, and carbon emissions, which are highly effective in improving public health and addressing climate change, are unpopular with the public and consequently shunned by politicians.\n\nMoreover, certain political interests and ideologies, such as neoliberalism, promote limited government involvement in the economy and public policy, emphasizing individual responsibility for achieving health, wealth, and happiness. These ideologies often characterize governmental interventions as intrusive and paternalistic. Industries that would be adversely affected by effective policies, such as those aimed at reducing fossil fuel consumption, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and unhealthy food consumption, also employ strategies to dissuade politicians from adopting such policies. They cast doubt on the effectiveness of these measures and engage in lobbying efforts to maintain the status quo, presenting a business case that aligns with their interests.\n\nIn order to effectively address pressing issues facing the UK, it is crucial to overcome these barriers and foster evidence-based policymaking. This can be achieved through increased citizen involvement, where their interests take precedence, and by implementing legally binding systems to ensure politicians are accountable at every stage of the policy-making process. By doing so, we can create a framework that promotes successful policy outcomes, benefiting both the nation's health and our efforts to combat climate change."}]}

In 2015, Canada joined all United Nations (UN) member states in adopting 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Additionally, Canada adopted the goals of the Paris Agreement, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. However, Canada has encountered challenges in translating these commitments into action.\n\nAccording to the UN Sustainable Development Report published in June 2022, Canada ranks 29th out of 163 member states in progress towards achieving the SDGs. Achieving net zero emissions is particularly ambitious for Canada due to its historical emissions. Emissions have largely stabilized since the early 2000s, partly due to technological advancements and slower growth in certain industries over the past decade. However, reducing emissions across the board has proven to be challenging. Meeting Canada's goals will require significant technological advancements and investments to achieve the necessary transformative change.\n\nAt BDC, we recognize our important role in helping Canada achieve its environmental sustainability objectives. We are committed to supporting entrepreneurs in building more sustainable businesses and have set the goal of achieving net zero emissions in our operations by 2025. Additionally, we play a critical part in bringing new technologies to market and ensuring that businesses developing these technologies can achieve financial success. Our future depends on it. The path to net zero emissions by 2050 relies heavily on opportunities driven by technological innovations. We aspire to serve as a catalyst by attracting more capital and fostering the growth of the sector in the ongoing global transformation.\n\nUnfortunately, Canadian sustainability companies face a lack of funding compared to their counterparts. BDC has a long-standing history of investing in the cleantech space. Our first cleantech fund was established in 2001, and we have since launched two additional funds. In 2018, recognizing the need for further action, we established the Cleantech Practice, a specialized investment team dedicated to cleantech, managing the $600-million Cleantech Fund I and investing in 50 impactful cleantech companies. This team now manages the $400-million Climate Tech Fund II, launched in November 2022. This fund aims to address the chronic lack of private risk capital for the commercialization and scale-up of Canada's climate tech industry. With these investments, our commitment to funding reaches $1 billion since 2018, positioning us as one of Canada's largest and most active investors in this field. The Climate Tech Fund II places a heightened focus on technologies that can significantly mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDespite these investments and the vibrancy of the Canadian venture capital ecosystem, a funding gap persists for companies driving the transition to a more sustainable economy. For instance, only 5% of Canadian venture capital investments were directed towards environmental sustainability companies in 2021, compared to 14% globally. Furthermore, US cleantech firms on an adjusted GDP basis raised three times more venture capital investment than Canadian firms. The Canadian government estimates that substantial investments, ranging from $60 billion to $140 billion per year on average, are necessary to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nTo address this funding gap and support Canada's sustainability goals, we are proud to announce the launch of a new Sustainability Venture Fund. This $150-million fund will focus on software, hardware-enabled software, and other highly scalable businesses with capital- and asset-light business models that are developing technology to enhance sustainability and indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Sustainability Venture Fund complements the Climate Tech Fund II. The main differentiators between the two funds are the business models of the companies they invest in and the capital requirements. While the Sustainability Venture Fund targets capital-light software businesses, the Climate Tech Fund II focuses on companies that are capital intensive and asset heavy."}]}

This accounts for a nearly 12% rise in per-person costs. The latest data comes from the Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms (CSUCH) 2007-2020 report, which was jointly released today by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) and the University of Victoria's Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR).\n\nOne of the most substantial costs was lost productivity, amounting to $22.4 billion or $589 per person in 2020. This figure includes the value of work lost as a result of premature deaths and both short- and long-term disabilities. Dr. Adam Sherk, a scientist at CISUR and a researcher for the study, notes that this emphasizes how substance use is not solely a healthcare concern. Employers can play a crucial role in supporting their employees by implementing supportive substance use policies and investing in prevention, harm reduction, and treatment programs.\n\nThe report categorizes substance use costs into four key areas. Lost productivity accounts for 45.6% of the total costs, healthcare costs make up $13.4 billion (27.4%), criminal justice costs amount to $10 billion (20.3%), and other direct costs contribute $3.3 billion (6.7%). These findings demonstrate the pervasive nature of substance use issues in our daily lives and underscore the need for comprehensive solutions.\n\nAdditional findings from the report include:\n\n1. Alcohol represents just over 40% of the total costs by substance, amounting to $19.7 billion.\n2. The costs of alcohol and tobacco use have diverged over time, with alcohol costs increasing by 21% and per-person tobacco costs declining by 20%.\n3. Opioid use incurred a cost of $7.1 billion in 2020, the highest among all substances examined. Nearly 75% of these costs were related to lost productivity, particularly premature deaths resulting from opioid use.\n4. Per-person costs of substance use increased by 11.8%, rising from $1,154 in 2007 to $1,291 in 2020.\n5. Opioids and stimulants experienced the most significant increase in per-person costs since 2007, reflecting the growing harm caused by the unregulated drug supply and drug poisoning.\n6. Following the legalization of recreational cannabis use, the per-person cost of cannabis decreased by 9.1% between 2018 and 2020, primarily due to reduced criminal justice costs.\n\nEmily Biggar, CCSA research and policy analyst and a researcher on the project, highlights that there were nearly 74,000 deaths attributed to substance use in 2020, equating to nearly 200 lives lost per day. Alcohol and tobacco alone account for over 85% of these deaths. These estimates underscore the impact of substance use not only on the healthcare and criminal justice systems but also on the ability of Canadians to work and contribute to the economy. It is crucial to implement initiatives that address prevention, harm reduction, and treatment across the spectrum to improve the health and productivity of individuals in Canada.\n\nThis report represents the third update in the Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms project, following previous releases in 2018 and 2020. The CSUCH report was developed by CCSA and CISUR to gain a better understanding of the economic costs and harms associated with substance use in Canadian society. These regularly updated estimates can be utilized to prioritize relevant public policies, develop initiatives to target the harms caused by substance use, identify information gaps and research needs, improve national data reporting systems, measure the impact of changing levels and patterns of substance use, and make necessary adjustments to policy and societal responses."}]}

However, the risks increase significantly with higher alcohol intake, including a higher risk of various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and violence. The new guidance advises individuals to limit their alcohol consumption to no more than 2 drinks per day on any occasion. In essence, less alcohol is better for one's health. This revised guidance aims to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health, taking into account their own drinking patterns. The guidance presents a continuum of risk associated with alcohol consumption, allowing individuals to assess their comfort level on this continuum. It is important to note that any amount of alcohol carries some level of risk. The report categorizes 1.1-2 standard drinks per week as low risk, 3-6 standard drinks per week as moderate risk, and 7 or more standard drinks per week as increasingly high risk. Regardless of where one falls on this continuum, reducing alcohol intake is beneficial for one's health. It is especially important for pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant to abstain from alcohol completely, as there is no known safe amount. Alexander Caudarella, CEO of the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA), emphasizes that individuals have the right to be informed about these risks and that the continuum of risk empowers them to make their own choices. Caudarella, a family physician specializing in substance use, underscores that every drink matters and that it is never too late to make positive changes. Health professionals can now better assess an individual's risk and work collaboratively with their patients to improve their health. Andrea Seale, CEO of the Canadian Cancer Society, further emphasizes the importance of this guidance, as many Canadians are unaware of the serious health risks associated with alcohol consumption, particularly the increased risk of various types of cancer. The guidance clarifies that reducing alcohol intake lowers the risk of cancer. The CCSA led a comprehensive two-year research project, examining nearly 6,000 peer-reviewed studies and involving a panel of 23 scientists from 16 organizations. The guidance also incorporated feedback from focus groups and three consultations with the public and stakeholders. The most recent public consultation received close to 1,000 survey submissions, all of which were carefully considered to ensure that the guidance is practical and easily understood by healthcare professionals, counselors, community workers, policymakers, and the public."}]}

This report summarizes conversations from a dialogue series held in May and June of 2022, engaging veterans, family members, service providers, and researchers in discussions about cannabis use and mental health.\n\nThe report highlights a strong interest among veterans and their families in exploring cannabis as a treatment option for conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. They also express a need for more research and guidance regarding cannabis use and its impact on mental health. Many veterans believe that their understanding of cannabis is limited to personal experiences and those of their peers, lacking scientific and medical research to make informed decisions about its potential benefits or risks in conjunction with other treatments.\n\nRetired Major-General Glynne Hines, Chair of the Atlas Institute's Veterans Reference Group and project advisor and moderator for the dialogue series, shares his perspective as one of the veterans approved for medical cannabis use. He emphasizes the importance of scientific and medical research to inform decisions about cannabis and its potential effects on other treatments.\n\nThe report also brings attention to several key insights:\n\n1. Health-care professionals require more training and guidance on cannabis use for mental health.\n2. Cannabis use remains highly stigmatized among veterans.\n3.

This annual event serves as a reminder of the importance of investing in our mental health system to meet the needs of individuals with lived experiences of mental health problems and illnesses.\n\nIn 2012, the MHCC's Mental Health Strategy for Canada set a spending target of 7 to 9 percent of healthcare funding for mental health. However, considering the current realities of 2022 and the impact of the global pandemic, it is clear that this target needs to be adjusted. Both the World Health Organization and the OECD have urged high-income countries like Canada to increase their spending on mental health care, and it is essential that we listen to their recommendations.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to listen to the voices of people living with mental illness. Recent polling has shown that one in three people in Canada reported moderate to severe mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Financial concerns, pandemic stress, isolation, and difficulties with the healthcare system are significant concerns among individuals with mental illness. Age, gender, 2SLGBTQ+ status, income, and employment status have been identified as strong predictors of mental health and substance use issues, with 60 percent of 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms and approximately 40 percent reporting symptoms of depression.\n\nWhile it can be challenging to connect with statistics, it is crucial to remember that these numbers represent real people. We must also prioritize the well-being of those who care for us. A recent report from the MHCC highlighted the moral distress and mental health concerns of healthcare workers, revealing that only 60 percent of them were confident in the care they provided to their patients. As our healthcare system faces strain, we must be mindful of the impact this will have on access and the quality of services for individuals seeking mental health care.\n\nFinancial concerns and inflation are top of mind for many individuals across Canada, and our own polling confirms that finances are one of the most significant stressors for people living with mental illness. The evidence clearly shows that the demand for mental health services has increased, and funding must catch up. This Mental Illness Awareness Week, let's move beyond awareness and take action by boosting investments in our mental health system.\n\nSincerely,\nMichel Rodrigue\nPresident and CEO"}]}

These efforts not only reduce operating expenses but also contribute to reducing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, a significant greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.\n\nFrom a social perspective, co-development platforms, digital twin technology, and aforementioned AR, XR, and VR tools ensure that the right experts can participate in business operations. Virtual access can be scaled in a way that physical access cannot, allowing more people to have access to training, skills development, and expert knowledge. For example, during the pandemic, Lufthansa developed a virtual table inspection of engine parts using 5G private wireless connectivity. This enabled real-time high-resolution video streaming, allowing colleagues spread across different locations to jointly inspect components and make decisions, ensuring uninterrupted operations and avoiding backlogs.\n\nOur study, conducted in partnership with EY and Nokia, covers four industry sectors - automotive, industrial goods and manufacturing, transportation, supply chain and logistics, and power and utilities. We also review four areas of the business value chain and map them to 12 metaverse use cases. In seven of these use cases, sustainability is identified as one of the top three business benefits. In three specific use cases, over 60% of respondents ranked sustainability as the top benefit.\n\nThese findings demonstrate the significant potential of the metaverse in delivering sustainability benefits across various industries and business functions. We are thrilled to share these insights and help businesses leverage the metaverse to achieve their sustainability goals."}]}

Chris Johnson, SVP and Global Head of Enterprise at Nokia, discusses ways to modernize these networks while maintaining their reliability and safety.\n\nMission-critical networks form the foundation of infrastructures that support essential functions and services across various sectors, including healthcare, power grids, air traffic control, and railway systems. These networks must deliver high uptime, performance, and security, as any degradation or outage can have significant, even life-threatening, consequences.\n\nWhile many mission-critical organizations are hesitant to change systems that are currently functioning \"well enough,\" this approach will become inadequate in the digital era. As other industries embrace Industry 4.0 digitalization, organizations that lag behind will struggle to keep up with the efficiency, productivity, savings, safety, and sustainability benefits that come with adopting valuable applications. Therefore, mission-critical operations should not exclude organizations from experiencing the advantages of Industry 4.0 digitalization.\n\nTo modernize and transition to more digitalized and connected business models, it is important to leverage the capabilities of today's fixed and mobile networks. These networks already incorporate technologies that maximize uptime, prevent failures, and contain security threats. IP-based fixed networks, combined with optical technologies, provide reliability, resiliency, and security while delivering the high-speed, low-latency performance required for Industry 4.0 applications. Network operators can enhance IP networking with proven multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) technology, ensuring fast, secure, scalable, and bandwidth-efficient network services.\n\nOptical transport, combined with fiber optics, offers the highest capacity and resilience, making it ideal for connected Industry 4.0 infrastructure. These networks provide built-in redundancy and powerful, integrated security features to protect data and ensure regulatory compliance. They also offer the ability to withstand climate change-induced environmental events. With fiber optics, data can be moved to alternative routes if any fail, guaranteeing its successful delivery. Integrated alerts enable prompt issue resolution with minimal downtime.\n\nExamining the energy sector as an example, Industry 4.0 technologies have proven beneficial in mission-critical operations. Power grids, which are vital for daily life, can experience significant disruption during outages. For instance, the ransomware attack on the colonial gas pipeline in 2021 led to fuel shortages and a national security threat declaration. Industry 4.0 provides advanced security technologies and applications to prevent and reduce outages and attacks. With digital technologies, operators can proactively monitor infrastructure and take preventive measures.\n\nEnergy providers can gain significant advantages from embracing Industry 4.0. They face the challenge of balancing electricity supply and demand, integrating renewable and local energy sources, and enhancing the grid's resilience against cyber and environmental threats. Modern networks that allow for increased intelligence in infrastructure operations, including ultra-low-latency mobile broadband, IP, and optical transport, are necessary. Furthermore, Industry 4.0 digitalization opens up new business opportunities for organizations in the energy sector.\n\nThe transportation sector is another area where Industry 4.0 can bring revolutionary changes. For instance, Deutsche Bahn in Germany is collaborating with Nokia to develop a standalone 5G network that enables real-time control of fully automated trains through an intelligent traffic management system. This innovation increases capacity, enhances safety, and ensures punctuality.\n\nIn conclusion, modernizing mission-critical networks is vital in the digital era. By leveraging the capabilities of existing networks and embracing Industry 4.0 digitalization, organizations can benefit from increased efficiency, productivity, savings, safety, and sustainability. The examples in the energy and transportation sectors demonstrate the transformative power of Industry 4.0 technologies and applications."}]}

However, achieving full gender parity is estimated to take another 132 years, according to the World Economic Forum. In order to bridge this gender gap, we must focus on four key areas. \n\nTo illustrate the importance of comprehensive research, let's consider the scenario of starting a travel business. A friend, named John, conducts market research and discovers a high demand for physically demanding adventure holidays. Seeking a well-rounded perspective, you consult your female friend, Jane. She reveals that John only spoke to her husband and failed to include her in the research. Understandably, this flawed approach raises doubts about the validity of the information gathered. \n\nSimilar to this situation, many businesses and governments base their decisions on the opinions of a specific demographic, disregarding the diversity within society. These institutions continue to be male-dominated, designed around a stereotypical \"reference man\" with physical attributes typically associated with men. This biased design hampers women's ability to thrive, as evident in the higher fatality rates for women in car accidents due to inadequate protection measures until recently. This gender inequality is further perpetuated by the fact that women's unpaid work, such as caregiving, is undervalued economically. \n\nThe World Economic Forum's 2022 Global Gender Gap Index measures progress in achieving gender parity across various metrics, including economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment. Despite progress, it is projected to take 132 more years to achieve full gender parity at the current rate. Additionally, the gender pay gap persists, with women earning less than similarly qualified male colleagues in the US, EU, and India. The underrepresentation of women in senior leadership positions is a contributing factor, alongside their additional unpaid domestic responsibilities. \n\nGender equality is essential for creating a fair and sustainable society, as well as driving economic growth. The correlation between gender equality and happiness is evident in the top-ranking countries in both aspects. Studies highlight the positive impact of women's participation in the workforce, such as economic diversification, income equality, and the introduction of valuable skills. For instance, matching the female employment rates of Sweden in OECD countries could boost global GDP by over $6 trillion. Moreover, having women in senior management or corporate boards enhances profitability. \n\nGiven the potential benefits and prosperity associated with greater gender equality, it is difficult to justify inaction on this matter. Countries, businesses, and communities must prioritize and actively work towards achieving gender parity."}]}

These fibers, similar in size to a human hair, form the backbone of the internet and enable the rapid transmission of millions of text, audio, and video communications. However, when this network experiences an unexpected outage, it triggers a complex and costly process to restore service and repair the damage. Mikael Mazur, a researcher at Nokia Bell Labs, aims to prevent such scenarios. His recent field trial demonstrates how communication fibers can also serve as environmental sensors, providing an early detection system for network failures.\n\nMazur's real-time coherent transceiver prototype, deployed in Sweden, can detect vibrations and distortions in the fiber.

Mazur will present these findings at the highly esteemed Optical Fiber Communication Conference in San Diego, California.\n\nBy extracting environmental information from the real-time digital signal processing engine, Mazur seeks to combine the two primary functions of fiber optics: communication and sensing. Fibers possess excellent vibration sensing capabilities, making them ideal for incorporating into existing communication cables. This integration enables a self-monitoring system, similar to the fibers found in bridges, buildings, and critical infrastructure. Distributed sensing can alert engineers to pending problems caused by extreme weather conditions and other external factors. When fibers stretch, engineers can proactively prevent breaks or reroute data traffic to avoid outages.\n\nWhile some fiber sensing technology already exists in submarine cable systems, Mazur's aerial cable, deployed in challenging conditions, is the first of its kind to be wrapped around high-voltage power cables suspended from outdoor poles. The goal is to design sensing functionality that is compatible with coherent optical transceiver architectures, as fiber is deployed extensively in the grid. Having prior knowledge of a link going down allows for minimal impact on the network.\n\nThis dual purpose offers an alternative to expensive, specifically designed fiber-sensing devices and provides vendors a competitive advantage in a time when improving speed performance is increasingly difficult.\n\nThere is a theoretical limit, known as the Shannon limit, to the amount of error-free information that can be transmitted over a communication channel. In the realm of optical fibers, we are approaching this limit as it becomes more challenging to increase speed per channel. Mazur believes that improving fiber optics through sensing is one way to make them more versatile. By utilizing multiple spatial channels within a fiber, higher capacities and innovative sensing approaches can be achieved.\n\nBeyond protecting the network, this new function has potential benefits in environmental monitoring, such as wind, temperature, and current measurements. In earthquake-prone areas, sophisticated seismic instruments are typically in place, but in other regions like the deep oceans, these sensing capabilities can provide valuable storm, earthquake, and tsunami warnings.\n\nFrom Nokia's perspective, the primary interest is network protection and ensuring reliability and robustness.

Recognizing the lack of a reliable resource for farmers seeking digital transformation, the team at Case IH took it upon themselves to drive this change. Their solution? The creation of the connected farm.\n\nCase IH understands the benefits of digital agriculture, including technologies like digital connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT), drones, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and analytics. By leveraging these technologies, agriculture can become more sustainable by reducing the use of pesticides, fertilizer, and water. Precision farming, made possible by these advancements, could lead to a yearly increase of up to 300 million tons in crop yields and a reduction of farming costs by up to US$100 billion if adopted by 25% of all farms by 2030.\n\nTo establish the connected farm as a testing ground for new technologies and gather valuable feedback from the farming community, Case IH required a connectivity partner familiar with Brazil's expansive agricultural landscape. Tim Brasil, already a partner on an existing agricultural project, eagerly embraced the connected farm initiative. According to Paulo Gouvea of Tim Brasil, agriculture is a vital sector for the country, accounting for 25% of Brazil's GDP.\n\nTim Brasil boasts the largest mobile network coverage in the country, present in over 5,400 cities and aiming to achieve 100% 4G coverage by 2023. However, the challenge lies in connecting Brazil's vast rural areas. With more than 300 million hectares of agricultural land, Brazil's rural farming communities presented unique obstacles for traditional service providers. Tim Brasil worked to develop a feasible business model that could extend reliable 4G LTE 700-megahertz connectivity to these areas, benefiting not only farmers but the broader community.\n\nWith a reliable connectivity partner secured, Case IH then turned its attention to finding the ideal location for the connected farm. The company sought a location that symbolized real Brazilian agriculture and showcased how rural connectivity could enhance productivity. After exploring various regions, Case IH found a suitable partner in \u00c1gua Boa, a small city in the heart of the main soybean production region in Mato Grosso state. This fast-developing agricultural area, with around 80,000 inhabitants, aligns perfectly with Case IH's vision.\n\n\u00c1gua Boa, meaning \"good water\" in English, was chosen due to its potential to demonstrate how technology could increase production without artificial intervention. Case IH viewed this location as a testing ground, believing that if they could succeed there, their methods would succeed throughout the country."}]}

As someone who has been involved in the microgrid space for nearly a decade, I was pleasantly surprised by Nokia's initiative. While I have worked on various aspects of microgrids, including financing, regulation, and technical development, the communication infrastructure has not typically been a priority. Participating in Nokia's #realaction microgrid series allowed me to gain new insights into this aspect where Nokia excels as a market leader.\n\nNokia has chosen microgrids as the topic for the second series of its real action campaign and has assembled a talented team of experts, including Leslie Labruto, Liana Jo Ault, Marilyn Waite, and the host, Jason Elliott from Nokia. Collaborating with these industry leaders was an exciting opportunity, as they each brought their own expertise to the table.\n\nThe challenge we face is immense - 789 million people worldwide lack access to electricity, and many more do not have a reliable energy supply. Significant investments in energy infrastructure are necessary, especially considering that renewable energy sources now account for over three-quarters of newly added power generation capacity. Microgrids take the decentralized nature of renewables a step further, providing reliable energy on a local, often community level. This makes microgrids suitable for communities in remote areas of Africa, as well as those facing energy reliability issues due to inadequate grid investments or natural disasters.\n\nBy integrating as much renewable energy as possible, microgrids play a vital role in our journey towards full decarbonization. Producing energy locally means utilizing the available renewable energy sources on-site. While geothermal and hydroelectric power are site-specific, solar and wind power are accessible almost everywhere. However, these intermittent energy sources do not directly match current energy demand, necessitating the use of flexible power units and energy storage systems.\n\nScaling up microgrids efficiently requires a profitable business case, meaning finding the right ratio of renewables for each microgrid solution. Operating a microgrid solely on renewables in regions with extreme seasonality would require costly energy storage systems. Therefore, it may be more practical to build microgrids that are not entirely dependent on renewables, with a smaller percentage utilizing 100% renewable energy. However, it is important for microgrid design to set the path towards further decarbonization as the costs of renewables and energy storage decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, Nokia's commitment to promoting microgrids as a solution to climate change and energy poverty is commendable. By bringing together industry experts and addressing the challenges surrounding microgrid development, we can make significant progress in providing reliable and sustainable energy access to communities around the world."}]}

Currently, SMEs make up 99% of Canada's businesses, yet only a small fraction, less than 4%, are exporting goods.\n\nThe report suggests that standardization could be a key factor in increasing Canadian SME exports. When trying to sell abroad, companies must meet various technical regulations, product standards, and certifications specific to the target countries. This process can be expensive and challenging, particularly if their technology does not align with the required standards and regulations.\n\nDiane Liao, the SCC Program Manager and co-author of the report, spoke about the challenges faced by SMEs and their reliance on the SCC for assistance in commercializing and scaling up their businesses. Liao emphasized the importance of analyzing how participating in standards development can drive exportation and contribute to Canada's economic growth.\n\nInternational standards have proven to be effective in addressing these challenges. They provide guidelines for certification and demonstrate compliance with regulations. By participating in the development of international standards, Canada can gain economic and political influence while aligning with its own interests. This strategic approach would ultimately reduce technical barriers to trade and enable more SMEs to access global markets.\n\nBased on the national SME survey results, the SCC's analysis reveals that Canada's participation in international standards development positively impacts exports and encourages greater SME involvement in international trade. Specifically, participating in additional technical committees where international standards are developed, such as ISO and IEC, could potentially increase the number of exporting SMEs by over 200, with an estimated value of CAD 516 million in goods.\n\nThis information is essential for SMEs and organizations supporting their growth, including the Government of Canada. Encouraging and investing in Canadian SME participation in standards development could lead to a significant boost in Canadian exports.

We mentioned that we would make smaller bets in speculative or unconventional areas compared to our current businesses. From the beginning, we have strived to do more and undertake meaningful endeavors with our resources. Some of these endeavors seemed crazy at the time but now have over a billion users, such as Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. We have not stopped taking risks and pursuing crazy ideas that excite us. \n\nWe believe that companies tend to become complacent over time, making only incremental changes. However, in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive growth, it is necessary to remain uncomfortable in order to stay relevant. While our company is currently performing well, we believe there is room for improvement in terms of transparency and accountability. Hence, we are establishing a new company called Alphabet. I am thrilled to serve as the CEO of Alphabet, with Sergey as President.\n\nWhat is Alphabet? Alphabet is mainly a collection of companies, with Google being the largest. However, this new version of Google will be more focused, with companies that are not directly related to our main internet products being housed under Alphabet. Examples include our health efforts in life sciences (working on the glucose-sensing contact lens) and Calico (focused on longevity). This new structure allows for more effective management as we can run unrelated businesses independently. Alphabet promotes the prosperity of businesses through strong leadership and independence. \n\nTypically, each business will have a dedicated CEO, with Sergey and me providing support when needed. We will carefully manage capital allocation and ensure that each business is executing effectively. We will also ensure that each business has a capable CEO and determine their compensation. Additionally, with this new structure, we plan to implement segment reporting in our Q4 results, where Google's financials will be reported separately from the rest of Alphabet's businesses.\n\nThis new structure enables us to maintain a strong focus on the exceptional opportunities within Google. Sundar Pichai plays a key role in this. Sundar has been articulating our vision effectively and I have been impressed with his progress and dedication to the company since October of last year when he assumed product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I believe it is time for Sundar to become the CEO of Google. I am grateful to have someone as talented as him leading the slightly more focused Google, which allows me to continue scaling our aspirations. I have been working closely with Sundar and will continue to support him and the company in any way I can. \n\nGoogle itself continues to innovate and create new products. Sundar will always prioritize innovation and pushing boundaries. He is deeply committed to our core mission of organizing the world's information. Recent achievements like Google Photos and Google Now, which utilize machine learning, demonstrate remarkable progress. Additionally, Google has services that maintain their own identity, such as YouTube, and Susan has done an excellent job as CEO, building a strong brand and driving remarkable growth."}]}

While many of us plan for retirement around the age of 65, unexpected circumstances, such as the global pandemic, may alter these plans. In fact, 8 million Canadians are now reconsidering the timing of their retirement due to COVID-19. While financial planning is often emphasized, the lifestyle adjustment is equally important, regardless of whether you are retiring earlier, later, or on schedule.\n\nTo make this transition as seamless as possible, we offer the following tips:\n\n1. Take it at your own pace: You know yourself better than anyone after spending many years with yourself. Whether it's jetting off to Paris or taking some time to relax and pursue personal interests before diving into retirement goals, listen to yourself and adjust accordingly.\n\n2. Stay connected: Regardless of your personality type, maintaining contact with loved ones is crucial. After spending much of your time surrounded by colleagues, ensure you have a level of social interaction that suits you. This can range from occasional coffee chats with friends to joining clubs or utilizing video chats to connect with family and friends.\n\n3. Prioritize your happiness: Your job provided structure, a sense of accomplishment, and a daily routine. In retirement, it's important to establish a new routine that brings you joy. Consider creating a retirement schedule or a list of daily goals to maintain a sense of purpose and productivity.\n\n4. Explore part-time work or volunteering: Engaging in part-time work or volunteering can provide connection, fulfillment, and a renewed sense of accomplishment. Whether you choose to volunteer at a healthcare facility or pursue a passion project, these experiences can be enriching. If you're unsure where to start, there are numerous resources available to help you find volunteering opportunities.\n\n5. Adapt to spending more time with your partner: If both you and your partner are retired, adjusting to spending more time together can be a significant change. It's important to be patient, supportive, and understanding of each other's needs. Rediscovering individual interests and maintaining independence can also contribute to a healthy retirement dynamic.\n\n6. Plan for healthcare: Even if you feel healthy at the beginning of retirement, it's essential to plan for potential health issues. Group benefits may end upon retirement, so it's wise to consider a health and dental insurance plan like FollowMe\u2122 that covers both expected and unexpected medical costs.\n\nNo matter when you retire, we wish you the best of luck, happiness, and good health as you embark on this new chapter."}]}

This new mode is activated when the iPhone is in landscape mode while charging, and it offers a more convenient and easily accessible display of information such as time, date, and weather. While it may seem mundane, it is actually quite brilliant.\n\nThe most obvious use case for Standby is as a bedside clock, and it serves this purpose well. Concerns about the screen backlight disrupting sleep are addressed with Apple's smart mode, \"Night Mode,\" which shifts all visuals to red, creating a cool and slightly masculine ambiance. This feature is clearly inspired by the \"Night Mode\" on the new Apple Watch Ultra but is arguably more useful here.\n\nHowever, one limitation of this bedside use case is that Apple currently does not offer a compatible dock to easily enter Standby mode. Third-party accessory makers do provide options, with Belkin's dock being a great choice (although a bit pricey). It is surprising that Apple has not capitalized on this opportunity. I anticipate that they will release a new iPhone charger alongside the iPhone 15, possibly a wireless charging \"puck\" on a stand. Perhaps they will even offer a charger like Belkin's that can also charge the Apple Watch, making up for the never-shipped AirPower.\n\nApple should not miss out on this opportunity to generate revenue. Third-party docks work well, but it is not in Apple's nature to leave money on the table. Another option for Apple would be to introduce a new type of case that allows the device to be propped up. Personally, I have been using a magnetic wallet-like accessory that attaches via MagSafe, and it works perfectly for elevating the camera system and propping up the iPhone. Apple could replace its current wallet product with something similar, as it would also enable Standby mode during charging using a cable.\n\nI particularly enjoy having the ability to prop up my iPhone with this case while it is connected to my desk through a lightning cable (and soon, USB-C with the iPhone 15). Standby mode offers a widget that allows convenient music control with a visually pleasing and easily accessible interface. It is a great way to see what you are listening to while having quick and intuitive controls. It almost feels like being a DJ while working. The large album artwork, which has been lacking in many digital music services, adds to the overall experience, especially when paired with a HomePod or AirPods.\n\nWhile you could simply open Apple Music on your computer to listen to music, the UI and overall experience in Standby mode are far superior. It reminds me of the old-school iTunes interface for the iMac, which came with a remote control. Standby mode brings us closer to that experience in a way, and I sometimes miss it.\n\nOverall, I am very enthusiastic about the Standby feature in iOS 17. It enhances the usability and convenience of the iPhone, particularly for bedside use and music control. I am excited to see how Apple continues to refine and expand upon this feature in future updates."}]}

In recent years, drug shortages have become more common due to global supply constraints, manufacturing problems, difficulties in obtaining raw materials, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Health Canada experts have been diligently working to address these shortages.\n\nStephanie Di Trapani, the Director of Health Canada's Drug Shortages Division, has dedicated herself to detecting, assessing, analyzing, mitigating, and monitoring these shortages for over a decade. In 2012, a critical national shortage of painkillers, anesthetics, antibiotics, and hospital injectable products revealed the need for a proactive approach and increased coordination among all stakeholders. This led to the creation of the Multi-Stakeholder Steering Committee on Drug Shortages (MSSC), which includes federal, provincial, and territorial governments, as well as health professional, patient, and industry associations. The MSSC aims to improve information sharing and identify actions to manage and mitigate drug shortages in Canada.\n\nAlthough the committee has improved responses to shortages, more information from manufacturers is needed to prevent and mitigate these issues. Timely reporting from manufacturers is crucial in reducing the impact of shortages. Health Canada has implemented regulations that require manufacturers to report existing and anticipated shortages, as well as discontinuations of certain prescription medications. This transparent reporting allows Health Canada to assess supply and demand, identify options to mitigate shortages, ensure effective communication, and work with stakeholders to prevent shortages and strengthen the supply chain.\n\nUnfortunately, some shortages are complex and beyond immediate control, resulting in longer durations. For example, Canada experienced a shortage of children's analgesics and antibiotics last fall. The unprecedented demand caused a shortage that lasted for eight months. However, Stephanie Di Trapani and her team worked tirelessly to find solutions, such as securing supplies from other countries and providing information and advice to affected parents and caregivers. Lessons from this experience have already been applied for the upcoming cold and flu season.\n\nWhile Health Canada experts and stakeholders work diligently to manage shortages, they cannot do it alone. Your assistance is crucial in helping to address these issues. To learn more about how drug shortages are managed and how you can contribute, please refer to the infographic below."}]}

To address this issue, communities implement heat alert and response systems (HARS), which help them effectively prepare for and respond to extreme heat events. HARS comprise community mobilization, alert protocols, communication plans, community response plans, and evaluation plans.\n\nRachel Siblock, a policy analyst in Health Canada's Heat Division, explains that HARS enable communities and regions to be ready for extreme heat events and know how to respond to them. The first step for communities is to determine the threshold that activates their heat response plans and activities, typically aligned with the alerts and warnings issued by Environment and Climate Change Canada. Once the threshold is reached, communities decide which activities from their plans should be implemented. According to Rachel, these activities can range from distributing bottled water and opening cooling centers to checking on vulnerable individuals at home. Each community has the flexibility to choose what actions make sense for them.\n\nVarious communities implement HARS differently. Urban centers may have easier access to cooling centers or splash pads, while areas with older populations may find it more effective to share information through physical materials in common areas like grocery stores and post offices. In rural areas, where the population is more dispersed, community messaging encouraging neighbors to check on vulnerable individuals has proven successful.\n\nAlthough HARS are primarily developed and coordinated at the local level, Health Canada provides guidance and information to help local and regional health authorities create evidence-based plans and interventions for extreme heat. Health Canada also facilitates connections between municipal and health officials, linking them with experts across Canada who can provide relevant expertise.\n\nRachel emphasizes that any action taken during a heat event has the potential to protect health, and increasing community leadership and support has proven effective. Communities are encouraged to reach out to the Heat Division and join Health Canada's heat community of practice, a network of people and organizations working together to safeguard Canadians from the health impacts of extreme heat.\n\nCurrently, a pilot project is underway in collaboration with BC's Interior Health Authority to develop culturally appropriate and safe HARS for indigenous communities in the region. Any community interested in developing their own HARS is welcome to contact the Heat Division and participate in Health Canada's heat community of practice."}]}

This may lead people to wonder why these outbreaks are occurring and if they are at risk. To fully understand the current situation, it is important to grasp the role of vaccination as a preventive measure in public health. Today, I invite you to join me on a journey to learn more about vaccines and their significance. I am incredibly grateful for Canada's long-standing history of robust vaccination programs and their positive impact on health. Allow me to share a few examples with you.\n\nVaccines have played a significant role in saving lives and improving the overall health of individuals in Canada and globally. They have been instrumental in limiting or eradicating the circulation of serious infectious diseases. According to the World Health Organization, vaccination prevents between 3.5 to 5 million deaths annually from diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, and measles. Early studies also indicate that COVID-19 vaccines have prevented millions of deaths worldwide. Thanks to vaccines, smallpox has been completely eradicated, and many other diseases have seen a substantial reduction in their prevalence.\n\nDue to their ability to prevent and protect against various diseases, vaccination is considered one of the most beneficial investments for improving population health and reducing healthcare costs. Vaccines work in collaboration with the body's immune system to decrease susceptibility to infections and the likelihood of developing severe illnesses. They also minimize the transmission of infections from person to person. By safely exposing our bodies to key parts of bacteria or viruses called antigens, vaccines enable our immune system to develop a response against them. Subsequently, if we encounter the same bacterium or virus, our immune system can quickly recognize the antigen and help prevent us from getting the disease or experiencing severe illness.\n\nFurthermore, certain vaccines contribute to community immunity, also known as herd immunity. This means that a higher percentage of vaccinated individuals in a community reduces the chances of the disease spreading. Community immunity is essential for safeguarding individuals who may be at higher risk of severe complications from vaccine preventable diseases, including those who cannot be vaccinated or for whom a specific vaccine may not be as effective, such as immunocompromised individuals.\n\nNow, let's examine some of the available vaccines and their significant impact in Canada. Aside from the vaccines mentioned earlier, there are vaccines that can prevent numerous other illnesses like pneumonia, meningitis, chickenpox, shingles, and hepatitis B, among others. Additionally, there are vaccines specifically developed for respiratory viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccines for travelers based on their destination country.\n\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is an example of a vaccine that has had a substantial impact. Measles is a highly contagious infection that can result in pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, permanent brain damage, and even death. Even a single case can spread rapidly among unvaccinated or previously uninfected individuals. To prevent measles from spreading, approximately 95 out of 100 people who have never had a measles infection need to be vaccinated. Fortunately, the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. In Canada, the introduction of these vaccines in the 1960s, along with their inclusion in routine vaccination programs, has led to a decrease of 98% or more in cases of measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\nOverall, vaccines have been a game-changer in public health, saving lives, and reducing the burden of infectious diseases. They are a crucial tool in improving population health and should be embraced as one of our best investments for a healthier future."}]}

While this foodborne illness may not be as widely known as others, its potential consequences are severe. Fortunately, botulism is very rare in Canada, thanks to the implementation of safe food practices and the tireless efforts of Health Canada scientists.\n\nBotulism is caused by consuming food and beverages contaminated with botulinum toxin, an extremely potent toxin produced by bacteria known as clostridium botulinum. Symptoms commonly include blurred and double vision, drooping eyelids, and difficulty swallowing and speaking. In more severe cases, paralysis may affect the muscles involved in breathing, necessitating the use of mechanical ventilation. Recovery can be a long process, sometimes spanning months or even years. Tragically, approximately one in ten people with botulism succumb to the disease.\n\nHealth Canada research scientist Dr. John Austin, along with lab technicians Dr. Richard Harris and Ryan Boone, analyze botulism samples and conduct research on the disease and the bacterium responsible for its occurrence. Their work is instrumental in finding ways to better protect Canadians from this threat. Let us delve deeper into their efforts to see how they contribute to our safety.\n\nIdentifying the Hazardous Toxin\n\nBotulism comes in various forms, with the main ones being foodborne botulism and infant botulism. Foodborne botulism can arise in environments devoid of oxygen, such as canned foods. It can also be found in other food items such as garlic stored in oil, carrot juice, salted fish, and traditionally prepared seal, whale, and walrus meat. On the other hand, infant botulism occurs when the c. botulinum bacteria, sometimes present in honey, proliferate within a baby's body and produce toxins. Since infants lack a sufficient amount of beneficial bacteria, c. botulinum can grow and generate botulinum toxin.\n\nCollaborating with the Medical Community\n\n\"Botulinum toxin is the most potent toxin known. The lethal dose for a person is estimated to be approximately 70 millionths of a gram or 0.00007 g, an exceedingly small amount,\" explains Dr. Austin. Due to the immense danger posed by botulism, early intervention is crucial. Therefore, doctors prescribe antitoxins to patients suspected of having botulism. They subsequently send clinical samples to the botulism reference service, overseen by Dr. Austin and his technicians, who confirm the presence of botulism. Thankfully, most samples do not test positive for the disease. However, this information is still valuable for doctors, allowing them to exclude botulism as the underlying cause of illness and thereby enhance patient care. In cases where botulism is detected, we collaborate with provinces and local health units to trace the source of botulism, leading to the recall of the contaminated food product and prevention of further cases.\n\nAssisting Food Manufacturers and Indigenous Communities in Enhancing Food Safety Practices\n\nIn addition to supporting the medical and public health communities, Dr. Austin and his colleagues tirelessly work towards making our food supply safer. \"We are constantly seeking ways to enhance food safety, making botulism even rarer. That's why we continue to explore novel methods to eliminate the bacteria and its spores,\" explains Dr. Austin. Among these novel methods is the use of UV light to pasteurize or kill c. botulinum in foods. If this approach proves to be both safe and effective, it could soon be adopted by manufacturers for commercial food production. Traditional indigenous foods, such as seal, are known to be potential sources of botulism. Recognizing this concern, Dr. Austin and his team collaborated with Dr. Daniel Leclair, a former researcher at the Nunavik Research Centre, to investigate the reasons behind this and develop mitigation strategies.\n\nWhile botulism remains a serious food safety issue, we are fortunate to have experts like Dr. Richard Harris, Ryan Boone, and Dr. Austin working diligently to protect us from it."}]}

This commitment is rooted in a historical context dating back to March 24, 1853, when the first issue of the Provincial Freeman, an anti-slavery newspaper, was published in Canada. The newspaper's motto, \"Self-reliance is the true road to independence,\" encapsulated the aspirations and hopes of Mary Ann Shadd, the first black woman in North America to publish and edit a newspaper. It recognized that emancipation from slavery was just the beginning of a long journey towards justice, equity, and economic freedom for black and afro-descendant people.\n\nUnfortunately, the struggle for equality did not end with emancipation. Instances of systemic anti-black sentiment persisted, as evidenced by the Vancouver land title clause used as early as 1928 to discriminate against people of African descent. Other examples include Viola Desmond's arrest in 1946 for sitting in a whites-only section of a movie theatre, and the closure of the last segregated school in Ontario in 1965 (with the final closure in Canada occurring in Lincolnville, Nova Scotia, in 1983). The intergenerational trauma experienced by black and afro-descendant communities remains a ever-present reality, as systemic anti-black racism continues to plague our society, including the financial services sector.\n\nTo achieve true emancipation, we must critically examine the workings of our society and address the barriers faced by equity-deserving communities. Collaboration with these communities is essential in identifying and resolving gaps in support. The financial emancipation of black and afro-descendant communities is vital for sustainable change, and this includes dismantling systemic barriers within our financial system to support their economic empowerment.\n\nWhile change often takes time, history has shown us that collective action can bring about a future where everyone can embrace their true selves, regardless of their identity. Intentional engagement, hard work, and a commitment to being better and active allies are necessary for realizing change. Although progress may sometimes appear slow, the impact of George Floyd's murder and the subsequent actions against anti-black racism have illustrated the urgency for change. A 2021 study conducted by Abacus Data in Canada revealed that change cannot wait, especially for black entrepreneurs who face significant challenges due to their race, including limited access to capital. Moreover, only 19% of respondents in the study expressed trust in banks to act in their best interests and that of their community.\n\nIn conclusion, it is our collective responsibility to work towards the financial emancipation of black and afro-descendant communities. By addressing systemic barriers and actively supporting their economic empowerment, we can create lasting change and a more equitable society."}]}

Buying a home is often the most significant financial commitment one will make, with down payments ranging from 5% to 20% or more. However, it's essential to consider additional expenses such as land transfer taxes, lawyer fees, home insurance, and inspections, which can accumulate rapidly based on location and property type.\n\nWhile creating a budget is a great starting point for saving, it is equally crucial to consider how you save, particularly if your goal is to purchase a home. It is worth exploring the registered accounts available to you, such as the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), and the newly introduced First Home Savings Account (FHSA).\n\nThese registered savings plans offer tax-free or tax-deferred growth and allow you to hold investments like Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) and mutual funds. TD now offers the option to open an FHSA, and we want to help you better understand how it works and how it can assist you in saving for your first home.\n\nThe FHSA combines features from both the RRSP and the TFSA. Similar to the RRSP, contributions to the FHSA are generally tax-deductible. Furthermore, when a qualified withdrawal is made from the FHSA to purchase an eligible home, the withdrawn amount, including income or gain, is not taxable.\n\nBefore delving into the specifics of the FHSA, let's review the basics of TFSAs and RRSPs. TFSAs allow your investments to grow tax-free within the account, and you are not taxed on interest earned, dividends, or capital gains (subject to restrictions). You can make tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA at any time, and you can save or invest in various options such as GICs, mutual funds, and cash. TD Direct Investing TFSAs even offer stocks and bonds as investment options.\n\nThe government of Canada determines the annual maximum contribution limits for TFSAs, with a limit of $6,500 for 2023. The lifetime contribution limit currently stands at $88,000, provided certain criteria are met. To learn more about TFSAs and contribution limits, please refer to our TD Stories article.\n\nOn the other hand, RRSPs primarily serve as retirement savings vehicles. Contributions to RRSPs are tax-deductible, reducing the total amount of taxes paid in a given year. These funds grow tax-deferred within the RRSP until withdrawal, and any eligible investment income is also tax-deferred. While primarily meant for retirement savings, RRSP funds can be accessed in specific situations, like the Home Buyers' Plan. Under this plan, you can withdraw up to $35,000 from your RRSP tax-free to use towards the purchase or construction of a qualifying home for yourself or a related person with a disability.\n\nAt TD, we are excited to offer the FHSA as a valuable asset in your journey towards homeownership. Our team is ready to provide guidance and support as you navigate the intricacies of saving for your first home."}]}

Discussing finances can be a delicate conversation, whether it's with family, friends, or a romantic partner. This becomes even more difficult during uncertain economic times when loved ones may be feeling financial strain.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Maru Public Opinion for TD, 82% of respondents said they are still able to comfortably pay their bills and meet their financial obligations. However, 75% stated that the rising cost of living has negatively impacted their ability to save and invest as much money as they would like to. Additionally, 59% reported that finding extra money to save or invest is a challenge.\n\nGiven that housing is one of the largest recurring expenses for Canadians, it's not surprising that some are choosing to live together to share the cost. Approximately 23% of Canadians live with a roommate or family member other than their spouse, and 79% of these respondents said they would find it difficult to live on their own. Convenience and money-saving were cited as the main reasons for living with others.\n\nLiving with a partner provides the advantage of having two incomes to work with when making financial decisions. According to the survey, the majority of respondents who live with roommates or family members would have the money talk before moving in with a partner or spouse. However, among those already living with their partner, 54% discussed money before moving in, while 21% discussed it afterwards. A small percentage (4%) admitted to never having a real talk about money with their partner.\n\nThe question of how to organize and manage finances with a partner or spouse is a significant one for long-term relationships. The survey found that 48% of respondents expect to have some joint accounts along with their own accounts, while 41% plan to keep their finances separate. Only 11% said they would merge their finances into exclusively joint accounts. Household income also plays a role, with lower-income households being more likely to keep their finances separate.\n\nOverall, the survey highlights the financial challenges faced by Canadians living with others and the importance of open communication about money matters.

However, the landscape has changed significantly. Today, there are numerous affordable, and sometimes even free, AI tools available to SMB owners.\n\nThese tools, ranging from chatbots to cashflow management software and cybersecurity protection, can make a significant difference for business owners seeking to automate customer service, streamline operations, and enhance the overall customer experience to drive growth.\n\nJeff Chan, Senior Manager of Enterprise Innovation at TD, leads a team that explores the potential role of emerging technologies, such as generative AI, in meeting future customer needs. Generative AI, a subfield of artificial intelligence that powers the openAI chatbot, ChatGPT, involves algorithms used to create new content, such as audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.\n\nChan emphasizes that the benefits of AI are already accessible to many small business owners and will continue to improve over time. Small businesses are already using automated decision making and degrees of automation to manage inventory, follow up with clients, and enhance research and development practices.\n\nThanks to the explosive growth of generative AI, we can expect fundamental changes in how we operate, think, and analyze data, even earlier than anticipated. However, Chan also acknowledges the early stages of generative AI and the associated risks that small business owners need to be aware of. Before implementing any new AI system, including generative AI, small business owners must assess these risks, as well as the terms governing the use of third-party AI systems, in relation to their specific use cases.\n\nHere are three areas where integrating AI into small businesses could prove beneficial once risks are understood:\n\n1. Delivering Human-Like Customer Service at Scale: Automation tools like interactive voice response (IVR) have become essential for customer service. IVR allows telephone users to interact with a computer-operated telephone system through voice or a telephone keypad. Implementing AI-powered chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, can enhance customer service by understanding conversational language and resolving issues in a more human-like manner. This frees up human service teams to focus on complex issues that require human involvement and ensures a more personalized customer experience.\n\n2. Gaining New Insights and Enhancing Customer Experiences from Existing Data: AI's ability to process large amounts of information rapidly allows SMBs to utilize their data effectively. AI can identify patterns, connections, and insights that might go unnoticed otherwise. Small business owners may not realize that they are already benefiting from AI-driven solutions to optimize their businesses. Cost-effective AI solutions empower SMBs to extract more value from their data, uncovering new revenue opportunities and enabling highly-personalized customer experiences based on preferences and behaviors.\n\n3. Streamlining Operations and Enhancing Efficiency: AI tools can automate various operational tasks, saving small business owners time and resources. By automating processes such as inventory management and client follow-ups, AI enables SMBs to focus on strategic activities that drive growth. As AI technology continues to advance, interactions between customers and digital platforms will become increasingly human-like, creating a more personalized experience.\n\nIn conclusion, small and medium-sized businesses now have access to affordable and powerful AI tools that can revolutionize their operations. By embracing AI, SMBs can enhance customer service, gain valuable insights from their data, and streamline operations to drive growth and deliver personalized experiences. However, it is crucial for small business owners to evaluate the associated risks and consider the terms of AI system implementation before adopting any new AI solution."}]}

In this article, we discuss the reasons behind the low supply of homes for sale and the potential effects of mortgage rates on housing prices.\n\n1. Why is the supply of homes for sale in the Canadian housing market low?\n\nAccording to TD economist Rishi Sondhi, several factors contribute to the limited supply of homes for sale. Homeowners are not being forced to sell due to a robust job market and the option to extend mortgage amortization in a high-interest rate environment. Additionally, rental property owners are holding onto their investments, given the strength of the rental market. Construction timelines have also lengthened, delaying the availability of new homes. Furthermore, some potential sellers are monitoring the market, waiting for favorable conditions before listing their properties.\n\n2. How do mortgage rates influence housing prices?\n\nTraditionally, mortgage rates and housing prices exhibit an inverse relationship. When mortgage rates increase, housing prices tend to decrease. However, it is essential to consider that mortgage rates are not the sole factor affecting housing prices. Other factors, such as the job market, population growth, and housing supply, also play a significant role. Notably, in the first quarter of 2022, both mortgage rates and housing prices rose simultaneously, reflecting the \"race for space\" phenomenon that occurred during the pandemic. The Bank of Canada's interest rate cuts and temporary government measures to support Canadians financially contributed to the surge in housing prices.\n\n3. What factors are impacting move-up buying?\n\nAn affordability challenge is hindering move-up buying, where individuals seek larger and more expensive homes. Due to this issue, prospective buyers are waiting for a more affordable market to make their move. Consequently, existing homeowners are staying in their current homes for an extended period, leading to a constrained supply of available properties.\n\nIn conclusion, while mortgage rates may influence housing prices, it is crucial to consider other factors such as the job market, population growth, and housing supply. The current seller's market in Canada is characterized by a low supply of homes for sale, driven by various factors such as economic stability, rental market strength, construction delays, and short-term psychological factors affecting homeowner decisions."}]}

This month, we are highlighting the inspiring story of Sona Mehta, Senior Vice President of Canadian Personal Banking at TD. Sona's journey reflects her family's history and the sense of community and belonging she found in Canada.\n\nSona's parents immigrated to Canada from India in the late 1970s, seeking a fresh start. Her father arrived first to search for employment and housing. Like many immigrants, hope and hardship intertwined during this process. Initially, Sona's father, an engineer, faced challenges finding work in his field due to employers prioritizing Canadian education and experience. To overcome this, he strategically modified his resume, downplaying his qualifications to secure factory jobs. Sona explains that this tactic prevented him from being viewed as overqualified.\n\nOnce her father secured employment and a place to live, Sona and her mother joined him in Canada when she was just two years old. Sona recalls her mother's bravery, as she had never traveled by plane before, leaving behind their extended family and life in India. Sona acknowledges the immense sacrifice her parents made for the prospect of a better life in Canada. Although her mother possessed a master's degree in psychology, she initially worked in a factory to make ends meet.\n\nAs the years passed, Sona's father found an engineering job, enabling the family to purchase their first home. The challenges her parents faced to establish their life in Canada deeply impacted Sona, shaping her career trajectory. Today, as Senior Vice President of Canadian Personal Banking at TD, she leverages her personal experiences to create improved banking products and services for customers, including newcomers to the country.\n\nSona emphasizes TD's commitment to diversity and inclusivity, values that attracted her to the organization and have kept her here. Through her involvement in TD's Pan-Asian Employee Resource Group (ERG), which is one of many ERGs within the organization, Sona actively contributes to fostering a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion.\n\nReflecting on her childhood in Brantford, Sona fondly recalls a secure and joyful upbringing. Although lacking material luxuries, she treasures the handmade dresses and bean bag stuffies her mother crafted. However, she also experienced a sense of not belonging during her school days. Unsure at the time whether her shyness or being one of the few South Asians in her school contributed to this feeling, Sona knew she didn't fit in. Looking back, she recognizes that true inclusion is irreplaceable and that one cannot truly address the feeling of not belonging until they genuinely feel included. This valuable lesson has guided her throughout her life."}]}

With Audiocraft, they can explore new compositions and effortlessly add soundtracks to their video ads without even touching an instrument. Audiocraft is our latest AI tool that generates high-quality, realistic audio and music from simple text prompts.\n\nAudiocraft comprises three models: Musicgen, Audiogen, and Encodec. Musicgen, trained with Meta-owned and licensed music, generates music from text prompts. On the other hand, Audiogen, trained on publicly available sound effects, generates audio from text prompts. We are thrilled to announce the release of an enhanced version of our Encodec decoder, which enables higher quality music generation with minimal artifacts. Moreover, we are launching our pre-trained Audiogen models, allowing users to generate environmental sounds and sound effects such as barking dogs, car horns, and footsteps on a wooden floor. As a final note, we are sharing all Audiocraft model weights and code. This open-sourcing initiative grants researchers and practitioners unprecedented access to train their own models on their own datasets, thereby advancing the field of AI-generated audio and music.\n\nWhile generative AI has made significant progress in the realms of images, video, and text, audio has trailed behind due to complexity and restricted availability. High-fidelity audio generation requires intricate modeling of signals and patterns at various scales. Music, in particular, poses unique challenges as it encompasses both local and long-range patterns, from individual notes to complex musical structures with multiple instruments. The Audiocraft family of models tackles these challenges and delivers top-notch audio quality consistently, all while being user-friendly.\n\nAudiocraft streamlines the design of generative models for audio, making it more accessible compared to previous work in the field. Users can explore the existing models developed by Meta over the past few years while also pushing boundaries and creating their own models. Audiocraft covers music, sound, compression, and generation, all within a single platform. Thanks to its versatility and ease of use, individuals interested in building better sound generators, compression algorithms, or music generators can do so in the same code base and build upon the work of others.\n\nBy establishing a solid open-source foundation, Audiocraft aims to foster innovation and revolutionize the production and consumption of audio and music. With enhanced controls, we believe Musicgen can evolve into a unique instrument, much like synthesizers did when they first emerged. The Audiocraft family of models serves as inspiration and invaluable tools for musicians and sound designers, fueling creativity, streamlining brainstorming sessions, and encouraging fresh approaches to composition. We eagerly anticipate witnessing the remarkable creations that Audiocraft will inspire.\n\nJoin us on this exciting journey with Audiocraft."}]}

To ensure a unique and personalized experience for everyone, we employ AI systems to determine the content that appears on our apps, taking into account the choices users make.\n\nIn a previous article, I discussed the relationship between users and the algorithms we use to shape content on our platforms. I aimed to dispel the misconception that algorithms render users powerless over what they see. I emphasized the need for more transparency in this relationship and greater control for users.\n\nToday, we are furthering our commitment to transparency by providing more information about the AI systems that incorporate user feedback to rank content on Facebook and Instagram. These systems enhance the likelihood of displaying relevant and interesting posts to users. We are also making it easier for users to control their content viewing experience through new testing and accessibility improvements. Additionally, we are offering experts more detailed information to enhance their understanding and analysis of our systems. This exemplifies our ethos of openness, transparency, and accountability.\n\nGiven the rapid advancements in powerful technologies like generative AI, it is natural for people to be both excited about the possibilities and concerned about the risks. We believe that the best way to address these concerns is through openness. As these technologies evolve, companies should be more forthcoming about how their systems operate and foster collaborative efforts across industry, government, and civil society to ensure responsible development. This begins by providing users with greater insight and control over the content they encounter.\n\nAI Predictions and Content Recommendations\n\nOur AI systems predict the value of content to each user, enabling us to present it promptly. For instance, if a user shares a post, it is an indication that they found it interesting. Therefore, predicting their likelihood to share is one factor considered by our systems. However, no single prediction can perfectly determine the value of a post to a user. Hence, we employ a combination of predictions, including those based on user behavior and feedback gathered through surveys, to deliver the most relevant content possible. We aim to be more transparent about this process.\n\nTransparency through System Cards\n\nMeta has long advocated for transparency and has been actively developing system cards that provide insight into how our systems function in an accessible manner, even for those without extensive technical knowledge. Today, we are releasing 22 system cards for Facebook and Instagram. These cards offer information about how our AI systems rank content, the predictions made by each system to determine relevance, and the controls available for users to customize their experience. They cover various sections like feed, stories, reels, and surfaces where users find content from accounts or individuals they follow. The system cards also encompass AI systems that recommend \"unconnected\" content from people, groups, or accounts they don't follow. For a more detailed explanation of the AI behind content recommendations, please visit here.\n\nIn addition to the information available in the system cards, we are sharing the types of inputs, known as signals, and the predictive models that these signals inform. These are instrumental in determining the most relevant content from a user's network on Facebook. The categories of signals we are releasing represent the vast majority of signals currently used in Facebook feed ranking for this content. For more insights into these signals and predictions, along with their frequency of use in the overall ranking process, please visit our Transparency Center."}]}

As Chief Information Security Officer, my primary focus has been to bring together teams working on integrity, security, support, and operations to maximize our collective effectiveness.\n\nOver the years, we have made significant progress in combating various threats, including covert influence operations, cyber espionage, and malware campaigns. This progress has been made possible through sharing our findings, collaborating with external experts, and partnering with other companies to address industry-wide challenges.\n\nIn particular, our bug bounty program has been running successfully for more than a decade, fostering collaboration with the security research community. We have also been transparent in publishing government data requests, takedowns of covert influence operations, and community standards enforcement reports since their respective milestones.\n\nThrough these initiatives, we have gained valuable insights on the importance of sharing both qualitative and quantitative data on our integrity work. It is encouraging to witness the growing participation of our peers in expanding their trust and safety reporting as well.\n\nRegarding our efforts in countering malware campaigns, our teams have diligently tracked and taken action against hundreds of threat actors worldwide. In our latest research, we have observed that malware operators, like spammers, adapt their tactics to capitalize on current trends, such as the popularity of generative AI technology. For instance, our security analysts have identified approximately 10 malware families disguised as chatgpt and similar tools, targeting accounts across the internet since March alone.\n\nSome threat actors have even developed malicious browser extensions, available in official web stores, that claim to offer chatgpt-related functionality while concurrently compromising users' accounts. To combat this, we have proactively detected and blocked over 1,000 unique malicious URLs from being shared on our apps. Furthermore, we have reported these URLs to file-sharing services, where the malware was hosted, to ensure appropriate action is taken.\n\nThis pattern of leveraging popular topics is not exclusive to the generative AI space. Throughout the industry, we have witnessed similar tactics employed in other trending areas, such as crypto scams associated with digital currency interest. As the generative AI landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for all of us to remain vigilant.\n\nAdditionally, we have observed that our collective efforts, alongside those of the industry, have prompted threat actors to rapidly adapt their strategies to evade detection and enhance persistence. One way they achieve this is by spreading across multiple platforms, including services like ours, LinkedIn, various browsers, link shorteners, and file-hosting platforms. When faced with detection, they diversify their lure themes to popular topics like Google's Bard or TikTok marketing support.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to express our unwavering commitment to continuing these efforts and ensuring the safety and security of our users and partners. The Q1 2023 security reports are a testament to our dedication, and we will remain proactive in combating emerging threats and evolving tactics.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support and collaboration.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\nChief Information Security Officer, Meta"}]}

Countering Surveillance-for-Hire Threats:\nAs part of the Tech Accord, Meta, in collaboration with industry peers Microsoft, Cisco, and Trend Micro, has published a set of principles and industry best practices. These guidelines aim to guide our collective response against malicious groups that indiscriminately target individuals worldwide. Within these principles, we emphasize maintaining the integrity and security of our products and services, investing in cybersecurity awareness for our users and the public at large, and actively countering the cyber mercenary market. These principles are informed by our extensive experience in countering these threats and complement our recent policy recommendations for a holistic response.\n\n2. Enabling Secure and Private Connections:\nWe understand the significance of internet disruptions in jeopardizing the fundamental human rights of individuals and restricting access to critical news and information. We have recently introduced a feature that allows users to connect to WhatsApp by proxy when their internet connection is disrupted or blocked. Furthermore, we are committed to integrating end-to-end encryption into our messaging services to safeguard privacy, especially for historically marginalized communities.\n\n3. Countering Government Abuse of Digital Technology:\nWe have dedicated substantial resources to combat the targeting of our systems by authoritarian governments seeking to surveil regime critics, opposition figures, and human rights defenders. When we identify such activity, we promptly take action on the implicated accounts, block the sharing of their domain infrastructure on our platforms, and, where possible and appropriate, notify individuals believed to be targeted by these malicious operations.\n\n4. Respecting Human Rights and Protecting Human Rights Defenders:\nSince the release of our corporate human rights policy in March 2021, we have diligently conducted human rights due diligence throughout our product design process and in times of crisis and conflict. This proactive approach aims to prevent or mitigate human rights risks to the best of our ability. We remain committed to protecting human rights defenders by supporting their presence on our platform and enabling them to advocate for human rights through strategic product, policy, and operational interventions. Transparency and accountability are paramount, as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We endorse the principles articulated in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Copenhagen Pledge on Tech and Democracy, which seek to harness digital technologies for the benefit of democracy and human rights. Moreover, we actively participate in various UN processes, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Internet Governance Forum, and the Freedom Online Coalition.\n\nAs we prepare for the Summit for Democracy, we are excited to collaborate with our partners and stakeholders to advance these commitments, fostering a more democratic and inclusive digital landscape. Together, we can make a meaningful impact and ensure that technology serves as a catalyst for positive change."}]}

At Meta, our mission is to build the future of human connection, and today I want to provide some updates on our ongoing year of efficiency, which will contribute towards achieving that mission. The primary objectives of this initiative are twofold: to enhance our position as a leading technology company and to improve our financial performance in a challenging environment, enabling us to execute our long-term vision successfully.\n\nOur efficiency efforts encompass several parallel workstreams aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency, significantly increasing developer productivity and tooling, optimizing distributed work processes, eliminating unnecessary processes, and more. Throughout this process, I have strived to be transparent about all the ongoing work. While I understand that many of you are enthusiastic about these endeavors, I also acknowledge that the prospect of upcoming organizational changes may create uncertainty and stress.\n\nMy intention is to implement these organizational changes as soon as possible within the year. This way, we can swiftly move past this period of uncertainty and fully focus on the crucial tasks ahead. Here is the timeline you can expect over the next couple of months:\n\n- Organizational leaders will announce restructuring plans aimed at streamlining our teams, discontinuing lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates.\n- Additionally, due to reduced hiring, I have made the difficult decision to further downsize our recruiting team. Affected members of the recruiting team will be notified tomorrow.\n- We anticipate announcing restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, followed by our business groups in late May. In a few cases, completing these changes may extend until the end of the year.\n- Our international teams will operate on different timelines, and local leaders will provide further details.\n\nOverall, we anticipate reducing our team size by approximately 10,000 individuals and eliminating around 5,000 open roles that we have yet to fill. This will undoubtedly be a challenging process, as it will involve bidding farewell to talented and dedicated colleagues who have contributed to our success. They have wholeheartedly dedicated themselves to our mission, and personally, I am deeply grateful for their efforts. We will support all affected individuals in the same manner as we have in the past and show them the appreciation they deserve.\n\nOnce the restructuring is complete, we plan to lift the hiring and transfer freezes within each group. Additionally, we have set the target of this summer to complete our analysis from our year of learning about hybrid work, allowing us to further refine our distributed work model. Throughout the year, we also aim to introduce a steady stream of developer productivity enhancements and process improvements.\n\nAs I have mentioned during our discussions on efficiency this year, a part of our work involves job reductions. These reductions are aimed at creating a leaner, more technically advanced company while also improving our business performance to enable our long-term vision.\n\nI understand that this update may come as a surprise to some, so I would like to provide broader context regarding our vision, culture, and operating philosophy. At Meta, we strive to build a better technology company every day. We recognize that in today's complex world, the need for human connection is more vital than ever. Our goal is to enable every individual to experience the same profound sense of connection they feel when physically present with someone they love. To achieve this, we are at the forefront of numerous advanced technologies, which we distill into inspiring products that enhance people's lives. This includes utilizing AI for creative expression and content discovery, delivering a realistic sense of presence through the metaverse, creating richer experiences through new media formats, facilitating private communication through encryption, and providing business tools that help reach customers, create opportunities, and foster economic growth.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking to invent the future or apply the best ideas to make a significant impact on a vast scale, Meta is the ideal place to do so."}]}

We are also thrilled to share how we are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in our pursuit of the metaverse by involving individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives in our product development. For a comprehensive overview, please read the full report.\n\nThe Impact of Remote Work on Diversity\n\nOur approach to work has evolved, and now, working at Meta is not restricted by geographical location. Approximately 75% of our teams are dispersed across multiple locations. For the first time, we have started hiring fully remote individuals from areas where we do not have offices. This has had a positive impact on the diversity of our candidate pool and workforce. Over the past year, we observed that:\n\n- US candidates who accepted remote job offers were notably more likely to be from Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, veteran, and/or disabled communities.\n- Globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were more likely to be women.\n\nFostering an Inclusive Metaverse\n\nWe are actively collaborating with diverse companies, developers, experts, and policymakers to build the metaverse, the next generation of digital experiences, with diversity, equity, and inclusion as foundational principles. For instance:\n\n- Our meta avatars offer over one quintillion different attribute combinations, ensuring representation and inclusivity through customizable features such as skin tones, facial shapes, and assistive devices like hearing aids and wheelchairs.\n- Recognizing that VR devices can be cost-prohibitive for many, we are developing a web-based version of Horizon Worlds, enabling people to experience virtual reality through devices like smartphones.\n- We are investing $150 million through Meta Immersive Learning to support diverse creators in developing skills in AR, VR, and immersive media. This is part of our broader effort to help creators from various backgrounds and perspectives thrive in the metaverse.\n\nExpansion of Workforce and Leadership Diversity\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, we set ambitious five-year goals to increase representation within our workforce. Our latest numbers demonstrate meaningful progress:\n\n1. 50-in-5 Update: We committed to doubling the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US, as well as the number of women in our global workforce, by 2024. We achieved and surpassed this goal for each group, two years ahead of schedule. We are determined to further enhance these achievements. Since 2019, the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US has doubled, and the number of women in our global workforce has also doubled.\n\n2. Additionally, we aimed to have underrepresented individuals constitute at least 50% of our global workforce. As of June 30, 2022, people with disabilities now make up 6.2% of our US workforce, up from 4.7% in 2021. Based on voluntary self-identification, veterans account for 2.3% of our US workforce, and members of the LGBTQ+ community represent 10.0%. Moreover, underrepresented individuals comprise 46.7% of our global workforce, up from 45.6% in 2021.\n\n3. 30-in-5 Update: In 2020, we set a goal to increase the number of leaders in the US who are people of color by 30%. Through promotions and hiring, we are on track to achieve, and in some cases surpass, this ambitious goal by 2025. For example, we have already increased the number of Black employee leaders by 44.1% since 2020.\n\nAt Meta, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment where everyone can thrive. We are proud of the progress we have made and remain dedicated to furthering our efforts in this vital area."}]}

The scientific evidence is unequivocal. As global leaders, advocates, environmental organizations, and others convene at COP26 in Glasgow this week, we strongly advocate for bold action and the adoption of robust commitments to achieve net-zero targets that will help limit global warming to 1.5\u02daC.\n\nWe are committed to playing our part in this global effort. As a global business that connects over 3 billion people monthly, we recognize our opportunity and responsibility to make a real difference. It begins with ensuring that our own operations are environmentally responsible. Since last year, we have achieved net-zero emissions for our global operations, powered entirely by renewable energy. Our greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 94% since 2017. We invest significantly in wind and solar energy to cover all our operations, and for the remaining emissions, we support projects that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere. Additionally, we have set ambitious goals for our suppliers to achieve net-zero emissions and for our operations to restore more water than we consume by 2030.\n\nSince 2013, we have contracted over seven gigawatts of new solar and wind energy, all within the same power grids where our data centers are located, which are among the most efficient in the world. We are also taking measures to reduce business travel emissions and have joined the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance as a founding member to expedite the transition to net-zero air travel through investments in sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that our efforts alone are insufficient. As social media companies, we possess the power to connect people at scale, amplify marginalized voices, and disseminate valuable information. Every day, we witness individuals using our platforms to raise awareness, mobilize action, and advocate for environmental causes. We aim to contribute by facilitating access to accurate, science-based information while combating misinformation.\n\nTo this end, we launched the Climate Science Center on Facebook last year, connecting people with reliable resources from leading climate organizations, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Program, as well as over 200 others. The center also provides individuals with actionable steps they can take in their daily lives to combat climate change. Today, we are expanding the center's reach to over 100 countries and introducing a new section that displays countries' greenhouse gas emissions in relation to their commitments and targets, enabling individuals to better understand their country's progress and the remaining challenges.\n\nFurthermore, we have introduced informational labels on climate change-related posts, guiding users to the Climate Science Center for further information. We are now expanding the application of these labels to posts in several countries, including Belgium, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and Taiwan.\n\nAddressing climate change misinformation is a responsibility we take seriously. That is why we collaborate with more than 80 independent fact-checking organizations worldwide to review and assess content, including information about climate change. When content is deemed false, we reduce its distribution, display warning labels for added context, and impose penalties on repeat offenders. In preparation for COP26, we have activated a feature that facilitates keyword detection, aiding fact-checkers in identifying related content more efficiently, as speed is of utmost importance during such critical events. This feature is available to fact-checkers for content in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, German, French, and Dutch.\n\nTo learn more about our efforts in combating climate change misinformation, please visit our website."}]}

Our security and integrity workforce has quadrupled since 2016, reaching over 40,000 people worldwide.

As the election draws closer, our efforts to protect the integrity of our platforms will continue even after the vote.\n\nOur response to potential interference in the electoral process includes various measures, such as preventing and stopping election interference and removing content that violates our policies on voter suppression, including posts that discourage people from voting. We are also committed to combating hate speech and the incitement of violence on our platforms.\n\nUtilizing artificial intelligence, we are able to remove 99.7% of fake accounts on Facebook before they are reported by users. We also investigate and disrupt networks that employ coordinated efforts using fake accounts to influence public discourse.\n\nAs we approach October, we will establish an elections operations center specifically focused on Brazil. This initiative, which we have implemented since 2018, brings together experts from various departments within our company, including intelligence, data science, engineering, research, operations, public policy, and legal teams. Their collaboration enables real-time identification of potential threats on our platforms and accelerates our response time.\n\nIn partnership with Brazil's Superior Electoral Court (TSE), we began adding labels to posts about political elections on Facebook and Instagram in December 2021. These labels direct users to reliable information on the electoral justice website, resulting in a tenfold increase in visits to the electoral justice portal within the first two months of its launch. We also posted reminders on Facebook to encourage users to request or update their voter cards, reaching the majority of adults on the platform in Brazil, with over three million people clicking for more information.\n\nAs the election approaches, we will once again display reminders on Facebook and Instagram to raise awareness among voters and reduce abstention rates on voting day. For the first time, the TSE will be able to report directly on Facebook and Instagram any content that may violate our policies, which we will thoroughly analyze upon receipt.\n\nWhatsApp introduced an extrajudicial communication channel during the 2020 municipal election to receive complaints from the TSE. This channel focuses on swiftly responding to potential cases of bulk messaging, which is prohibited by local electoral law and the app's terms of service. Furthermore, we have collaborated with the TSE to develop a virtual assistant on WhatsApp, accessible through the number +55 61 9637-1078, allowing voters to engage directly with the electoral authority and obtain relevant voting information.\n\nTo ensure transparency and understanding, Meta has conducted training sessions for electoral officials across Brazil. These sessions cover our efforts to combat misinformation, provide insights into how Facebook and Instagram operate, and explain our community standards and guidelines. We also offer workshops to candidates and their campaign teams.\n\nLastly, our partnership with the TSE includes booklets containing information for the electoral community, as well as a guide to combating online violence against women in politics, supported by the Women's Democracy Network (WDN) - Brazil Chapter."}]}

Our technologies provide a crucial platform for individuals to exercise their human rights, enabling them to freely express themselves, shed light on significant issues, and hold those in power accountable. While we understand that technology can be misused to exacerbate social tensions and suppress fundamental rights, we remain committed to upholding our corporate human rights policy by conducting human rights impact assessments. These assessments allow us to better understand how our technologies contribute to society and how we can prevent and mitigate associated risks.\n\nToday, we are pleased to share the findings of the independent assessment commissioned in the Philippines, along with the actions we have taken in response to the recommendations. We acknowledge that the challenges outlined in the report are complex and evolving, and we will continue to adapt our approach and strategies to foster the promotion of human rights.\n\nThe assessment revealed that Meta technologies play a vital and positive role in the Philippines, providing access to economic opportunities, giving a voice to individuals, and serving as essential tools in monitoring and defending human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it also identified significant human rights risks in the country, including concerns about the misuse of our technologies for spreading misinformation and disinformation, online harassment, and incitement of violence. We have taken concrete steps to address these risks, as well as others mentioned in the report, in our ongoing effort to ensure the safety of our users.\n\nThe assessment was conducted by Article One, a specialized human rights and ethics consulting firm, in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Their research methodology involved qualitative interviews with journalists, child protection specialists, and civil society activists, as well as a survey of 2,000 Filipino Facebook users. Additionally, the assessment utilized an innovative approach, combining traditional stakeholder consultation methods with a quantitative survey to capture the experiences of various vulnerable groups, including LGBTQ+ individuals and journalists.\n\nIn response to Article One's recommendations, we have committed to implementing 24 of them, partially implementing 7, and are currently assessing the feasibility of another 9. We have outlined our progress and response to these recommendations in line with our human rights policy. While we have made strides in addressing many of the report's recommendations, we recognize that more work remains to be done.\n\nOne key area identified in the report is the development of a risk mitigation plan for the 2022 Philippine presidential election, specifically regarding disinformation. To this end, we have prioritized investing in risk mitigation and preparation efforts for this election, forming a cross-functional working group dedicated to its preparation. We have also provided resources and training for stakeholders on digital advocacy, community standards, online safety, and political advertising. In collaboration with the Philippine Commission on Elections and civic organizations such as the Legal Network for Truthful Elections (LENTE), we have launched a civic education campaign, conducted training on our community standards, and held roundtables with civil society. Furthermore, we have expanded our flagship digital literacy program, Digital Tayo, to include modules on civic education, focusing on community engagement and empowerment in preparation for the elections. We have also enhanced our global policies to address voter interference and misinformation, working closely with civil society, electoral authorities, and the industry.\n\nIn conclusion, we remain dedicated to promoting human rights through our technologies. We are actively addressing the recommendations provided in the independent assessment, taking substantial measures to mitigate risks and support the safety of users in the Philippines and beyond."}]}

This innovative platform will initially facilitate enhanced sharing of information among medical regulators, streamlining the provision of medical care and ensuring the highest standards of treatment for all Canadians. Join us on this exciting journey as we explore the benefits of the NRP.\n\nIn October 2022, the Government of Canada, under the Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program, approved a funding request that will enable the MCC to establish the NRP. This groundbreaking initiative received support from 12 provincial and territorial medical regulatory authorities (MRAs), and we are delighted to announce that the funding was officially announced on March 15, 2023. Since then, we have received positive feedback from the medical community and inquiries about how this new registry aligns with the overall discussion on national or portable licensure. These inquiries underscore the significance of the NRP as a milestone in the integration of healthcare data in Canada, serving as an indispensable resource for MRAs, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patients alike.\n\nThe NRP is currently under development, and the project team is benefiting from valuable input from a working group consisting of 18 members from MRAs across the country. These insights are contributing to the creation of a national tool that will adhere to provincial and territorial requirements while remaining accessible to all. The NRP will integrate critical data already collected by provinces and territories, enhancing its utility by providing access across jurisdictions.\n\nOnce completed, the NRP will be a comprehensive cloud-based database that offers information on all licensed physicians in Canada. It will include their credentials, education, and any disciplinary actions or sanctions taken against them. The NRP will eliminate the need to gather files from multiple MRAs, simplifying the decision-making process for interested parties and users, and facilitating the mobility of physicians.\n\nThis initiative will showcase the MCC's commitment to delivering excellent, safe patient care while leveraging our extensive experience in collaborative information exchange databases. The MCC will act as a dedicated agent for provincial and territorial entities, enabling smooth communication and timely exchange of accurate data.\n\nThe NRP will be a dynamic and evolving database, regularly updated to reflect changes in the medical profession. Initially, it will be accessible to authorized users, starting with MRAs, and expanding in the future to the public and other interested parties. Certain sections of the NRP will have restrictions in place to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the contained information.\n\nThe NRP represents a significant step forward in the MCC's ongoing efforts to enhance healthcare delivery in Canada. Through this initiative, the MCC demonstrates its unwavering commitment to ensuring the highest quality of care for patients nationwide. By providing a comprehensive and accessible database of physician information, the NRP will empower MRAs, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patients to make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes for all Canadians.\n\nThe MCC is proud to lead this groundbreaking initiative and eagerly anticipates the positive impact it will have on the Canadian healthcare system for years to come."}]}

With over 20% of adults in the country lacking access to a primary care provider, medical experts are searching for solutions to address this urgent healthcare need. One proposed solution is to integrate more International Medical Graduates (IMGs) into the Canadian workforce through the PRA pathway. This pathway fast-tracks the licensing process for physicians who have completed their medical training and residency abroad.\n\nPRA programs are considered a safe and efficient way to bring qualified doctors into practice faster and alleviate the strain on the healthcare system. The programs are gaining attention and expanding rapidly, particularly in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Increased funding from provincial governments in these regions is helping these programs scale up and bring more doctors into communities that are in great need.\n\nIn 2022, the Saskatchewan International Physician Practice Assessment (SIPPA) program saw an increase in capacity, resulting in 45 family physicians completing the assessment compared to 36 in previous years. The Practice Readiness Assessment (PRA-AB) in Alberta also experienced a significant increase in assessments, enrolling a total of 92 IMGs in its preliminary clinical assessment in 2022, representing a 35% increase from the previous year. In British Columbia, the Practice Ready Assessment - British Columbia (PRA-BC) program will see a substantial increase in capacity next year, nearly tripling the number of family medicine seats from 41 in 2023 to 96 in 2024.\n\nWhile these expansions are exciting, they also require careful planning and consideration. The PRA-BC program, for example, is currently focusing on operational changes that may be necessary to accommodate such rapid growth. The program is also exploring the capacity to host more clinical field assessments and whether there are enough sites to support the influx of candidates.\n\nWhat sets Alberta apart is that all registration assessments for IMGs are managed by the provincial medical regulator, the College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPSA). This integrated approach allows the team to benefit from the knowledge and expertise of all CPSA departments. In January 2023, the PRA-AB program launched a pilot project to streamline the assessment process for IMGs with training comparable to Canadian universities. This project waives the preliminary clinical assessment step and enables accelerated entry into the workforce, with candidates completing a supervised practice assessment while working in their practice location. However, eligible candidates are still required to complete a competency assessment to ensure they provide safe and high-quality patient care.\n\nMaintaining high standards is a priority for both PRA-AB and PRA-BC. Dr. Ryan McCallum, Clinical Director of the PRA-BC program, emphasizes that even with substantial changes, the program will not compromise on the quality of its application criteria. Feedback from consultations has made it clear that growth should not come at the expense of applicants' clinical skills. Instead, areas such as post-program community support and customer service can be refined to make PRA-BC more appealing to skilled applicants.\n\nIt is important to note that while the assessment process may vary between provinces, all PRA programs uphold common standards and have similar eligibility requirements. These standards, developed through the National Assessment Collaboration (NAC) PRA framework, ensure consistency and support programs in their admission and assessment decisions."}]}

"assistant", "content": "The Saskatchewan International Physician Practice Assessment (SIPPA) is excited to announce the launch of a new post-assessment program on June 15, 2023. International medical graduates (IMGs) are a crucial part of Canada's physician workforce, especially in Saskatchewan, where half of the practicing physicians are internationally trained. The SIPPA program plays a significant role in rural healthcare by providing an accelerated 12-week clinical assessment to ensure IMGs have the necessary skills and knowledge to practice effectively and safely in Canada.\n\nSince its establishment in 2011, the SIPPA program has successfully assessed 507 physicians. The program is highly valued by the provincial government for the essential role its graduates play in improving access to care in rural Saskatchewan. Recently, the program received funding from the Ministry of Health, allowing for important changes. In 2022, the program expanded its capacity from 36 to 45 participants per year. In early 2023, a program was launched to support SIPPA participants after their clinical assessment until they obtain full licensure.\n\nTo enhance patient care and support physicians working in rural and regional communities in Saskatchewan, the SIPPA program has focused on improving educational support during orientation and the assessment period. Additionally, the program has provided more resources specifically tailored to rural practice. Dr. Jon Witt, SIPPA's medical director, explains that the program reviewed assessment outcomes over the past two years to identify strengths and areas for improvement, particularly in emergency care. As a result, new courses in advanced trauma life support, pediatric advanced life support, and an approved airway course were introduced with funding from the Committee on Rural and Regional Practice and the Saskatchewan Medical Association. Dr. Witt believes that these increased resources will enhance participants' skills and confidence in handling emergency situations.\n\nRecognizing the importance of assessors, SIPPA faces the challenge of recruiting sufficient physician assessors as the number of IMGs in the program continues to rise. However, Dr. Witt expresses gratitude for the commitment of SIPPA assessors who support the increased capacity and take on additional work while managing their own practices. These assessors understand the need for a robust assessment and the importance of supporting the needs of rural communities.\n\nTo provide better support for physicians as they transition into their communities, SIPPA launched a comprehensive post-assessment program in January 2023. Previously, supervision after assessment was overseen by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. However, the new program aims to follow physicians on their post-practice-ready assessment (PRA) journey until they obtain full licensure. The program acknowledges that physicians do not complete the 12-week assessment fully prepared and ready to practice independently. Therefore, ongoing learning, support, and coaching are crucial. The curriculum of the post-assessment program incorporates educational milestones from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, feedback from past participants, family medicine leads, and chiefs of staff. It addresses identified knowledge and skills gaps during the transition into Canadian practice.\n\nDuring the first year post-assessment, physicians actively engage in a continuing education program, participating in simulations and attending weekly sessions on various clinical topics. Some sessions also cover patient and team communication, as well as personal wellness. The SIPPA program is committed to supporting IMGs throughout their post-assessment journey and ensuring they have the necessary resources and education to thrive as physicians in Saskatchewan's communities."}]}

This marks the third successful in-person delivery of the NAC examination during the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIn July 2021, the MCC made the decision to conduct the October 2021 sessions of the NAC examination in person at various test centers across the country. Despite the continuing presence of COVID-19 in Canada and globally, our top priority was to prioritize the well-being of the medical community and ensure the safety of all involved in our exams. We worked collaboratively with our stakeholders to ensure this remained the case for the October 2021 NAC examination.\n\nDuring the administration of the October 2021 NAC examination, the MCC strictly adhered to public health recommendations and followed provincial vaccination protocols to safeguard the safety of all participants. Each test center implemented physical distancing measures and other personal protective measures in accordance with the guidelines provided by local public health authorities. We extend our gratitude to all candidates for their compliance with test center vaccination policies, as well as the physician examiners, standardized participants (SP), and exam staff who played a crucial role in the exam administration. We would also like to express our appreciation to the site administrators, SP trainers, and chief examiners for their close collaboration, dedication, and cooperation, which greatly contributed to ensuring a safe, efficient, and reliable exam experience for all candidates.\n\nIn terms of the results, the MCC will provide pass or fail decisions, total scores, and subscores. The exam results will be available in early December to meet the CARMS R-1 main residency match deadline. For more information on the NAC examination and the 2022 CARMS R-1 main residency match, please refer to our application and eligibility web page.\n\nLooking ahead, the next NAC examination is scheduled to take place in March 2022, with applications opening in November 2021. Candidates can submit their email addresses to receive a notification when registration opens.\n\nThe NAC examination serves as an assessment of a candidate's readiness to enter a Canadian residency program. It is a national, standardized examination designed to evaluate the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for postgraduate training in Canada. The NAC examination follows an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) format, consisting of a series of stations presenting candidates with typical clinical scenarios. All candidates rotate through the same series of stations during a given administration. Approximately 1,700 candidates challenge the NAC examination annually."}]}

In June 2019, over 2000 candidates participated in the May 2019 session of the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part II at various locations across the country. This two-day clinical exam rigorously assesses the core competence, knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for all physicians.\n\nIn order to maintain the integrity and security of this high-stakes exam, candidates are required to undergo a stringent security protocol to verify their identity. However, we have recently become aware that there were inconsistencies in how exam site staff implemented the MCC's identity verification policies, specifically in relation to candidates wearing religious head coverings. Some individuals experienced more intrusive scrutiny and identification measures compared to their colleagues.\n\nAs a leading authority in the assessment of physicians, the MCC takes this matter very seriously. We are fully committed to respecting and promoting diversity. It is our firm belief that all candidates, regardless of their religion, ethnic origin, or needs, should be treated equally, respectfully, and fairly during MCC exams.\n\nTo prevent such incidents from happening again, the MCC will be conducting a thorough review of our exam day policies. Additionally, a working group will be established to review exam day practices and policies. Following this comprehensive assessment, we will reinforce our policies with exam site supervisors and provide diversity and inclusion training to both the MCC and exam site staff to ensure better support for all candidates.\n\nOur objective is to ensure that moving forward, MCC policies are clear and consistently implemented across all exam sites. We encourage any candidate who has relevant information for the working group or has been impacted by identification measures but did not have an opportunity to submit an incident report at their exam session to share their concerns through their PhysiciansApply.ca account.\n\nThe MCC is excited about the positive changes that will result from these actions, and we remain committed to providing the best possible experience for all candidates."}]}

Shannon McBride, a physician assistant at the clinic, believes that this influx of candidates allows for personal connections to be made. The patients themselves see this as a positive, with only a small percentage preferring to see their family doctor instead.\n\nThe candidates who have been assessed at the Hanna Medical Clinic have all found success, with many going on to practice in rural communities throughout Alberta. This success story began in 2010 with the launch of the Practice Readiness Assessment Alberta program by the College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta. Dr. Emad Hanna, coincidentally sharing a name with his town, offered to assess candidates at the Hanna Medical Clinic after completing the required assessor training. As an international medical graduate from Egypt himself, Dr. Hanna understands the challenges of starting a medical practice in Canada and values the training he received from assessors in Glasgow, UK.\n\nThe clinic has since welcomed several candidates each year for three-month assessments, providing much-needed medical care to the vast rural community of Hanna and its surrounding areas. The clinic sees 20 to 30 patients per day, along with urgent cases, and the family physicians on staff also work at the local hospital, long-term care facility, and seniors' lodge. The demands of healthcare in an aging population are evident, but the arrival of new doctors eager to practice in a rural area is seen as a positive by the community.\n\nMs. Voltner, the clinic's office manager, attributes much of the success of the practice-ready assessment candidates to Dr. Hanna's phenomenal assessment skills and approachability. He takes the time to explain the reasoning behind his assessments and directs candidates to use clinical practice guidelines and consult with specialists when necessary. The clinic's dedication to supporting international medical graduates extends beyond assessments, as one of the other family physicians at the clinic is also an IMG. In fact, the clinic will soon welcome a new doctor who is herself a graduate of the practice readiness assessment program.\n\nOverall, the Hanna Medical Clinic has become a haven for practice-ready assessments, providing a supportive environment for candidates and quality care to the rural community. The enthusiasm and dedication of the clinic's staff, led by Dr. Hanna, have been instrumental in the success of the program."}]}

Now, we have the convenience of electronic reading devices like the Kindle, which allow us to read and highlight multiple titles without the burden of carrying physical books. Additionally, we have embraced the new trend of listening to narrated audiobooks, although some individuals are still resistant to this change. While books and ebooks hold a nostalgic value, audiobooks provide a hands-free reading experience and add a new dimension through tonality.\n\nA simple search for \"audible\" on Google reveals an intriguing statement in a Google ad: \"Listening is the new reading.\" This suggests that audiobooks have become a preferred method of consuming content. Looking ahead, I anticipate several key advancements in the field of audiobooks:\n\n1) Narrator-less audiobooks: While driverless cars capture attention and generate headlines, a more immediate development is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate the need for human narrators in audiobooks. Unlike a few years ago, AI voices now sound remarkably human, with tonality infused into the digital assistants we interact with. Although we can still distinguish computerized voices from real human voices, we are rapidly approaching a point where this distinction will become unnoticeable. The elimination of human narrators will lead to increased production, higher profit margins, and faster time-to-market for audiobooks.\n\n2) Increasing competition: Audiobooks are not just competing with books or ebooks; they now face competition from podcasts, music playlists, meditation apps, YouTube, phone calls, and even in-person conversations. The rise in popularity and convenience of Apple's AirPods has contributed to the growing trend of listening. As a result, audio apps of all kinds are becoming more ambitious. While streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime compete for screen time, podcasts, audiobooks, music apps, and phone calls will compete for our attention.\n\n3) Informative to engaging: Some individuals who enjoy reading books or ebooks may not have transitioned to audiobooks because they tend to zone out while listening. To convert these readers to listeners, we may see the introduction of more customization options for AI-generated narration, ranging from \"monotonous\" to \"dramatic\" or even \"rap music.\" In the realm of audiobooks, advancements in voice emulation will allow users to choose from a wide range of narrators, including celebrities or even their own grandparents.\n\n4) Convergence of media: There are avid readers who prefer to read, while others are passionate about audiobooks and are rarely seen without their AirPods. However, it is not a binary choice. Some individuals enjoy both reading and listening simultaneously. Currently, book, ebook, and audiobook purchases for the same title are considered separate entities, potentially due to poor integration, individual revenue optimization, or the assumption that people exclusively choose one experience over the other. In the future, we can expect audiobooks to be bundled for free or at a nominal price with book and ebook purchases. Captions on audiobooks will become the new ebook. Audible is already working on two features to address this convergence: immersion reading and audible captions.\n\n5) Auto-translation: The expansion of the audiobook market is not limited to converting readers to listeners. There is a vast untapped audience worldwide who either do not prefer to read in English or are unable to read at all. Providing stories in regional languages and accents can unlock a massive market opportunity, especially in the self-help category. The scale of translating millions of books into over 1,000 languages and numerous accents can only be achieved through technology. Stories and knowledge have the power to transform individuals, whether they are investment bankers on Wall Street or fruit sellers in Asia. Just imagine how real-time language translation with Google Pixel Buds could revolutionize travel. However, this is a topic for another discussion.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, please show it some love. Did I overlook anything? Did you spot any weaknesses in my arguments? If so, please let me know in the comments."}]}

One valuable tool that I personally utilize is the Chrome extension known as New Tab Draft. This extension transforms new tabs and windows into a convenient notepad, ideal for jotting down thoughts, reminders, and most importantly, your to-do list. By keeping your to-do list in a highly visible and easily accessible location, you provide yourself with a constant reminder to stay focused and on track. This method has proven highly effective for individuals across various professions, including startup founders, caregivers, parents, office workers, and legal professionals. The key is to avoid overwhelming your to-do list with an excessive number of tasks and instead concentrate on solving no more than three (preferably one) major task each day. \n\nAnother valuable technique, inspired by the prolific writer James Altucher, is the practice of brainstorming ten ideas daily. This exercise enhances creativity by challenging your mind to generate a multitude of ideas. As a writer, I have personally found this exercise to be remarkably beneficial. While most of the ideas may not be utilized, there is often at least one or two gems among the ten that can be developed into exceptional pieces. I highly recommend this practice to individuals from all walks of life, even those who do not consider themselves writers. For example, if you are a parent seeking dinner ideas, try jotting down ten potential meals. If you are a comedian, challenge yourself to create ten jokes. If you are an artist, engage in ten quick sketches. The true value of this exercise lies not only in the improvement of creativity but also in the concept that generating a larger quantity of ideas increases the likelihood of discovering brilliant ones. \n\nA simple yet often overlooked step towards increasing productivity is disabling all notifications and putting your phone on silent. Social media notifications, email alerts, and other forms of notifications can significantly disrupt workflow. We are instinctively drawn to these notifications due to the gratifying feeling of accomplishment elicited when we respond to them. This sensation is attributed to the release of dopamine in our brains, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure. To mitigate distractions, it is advisable to adjust the settings on your phone to disable or silence notifications. Personally, I use the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature on both my MacBook and iPhone to achieve this. In instances where I cannot completely avoid notifications, such as those from Medium (as writing is my profession), I utilize a Chrome extension called Stylish. This extension allows me to customize the appearance of websites and conveniently hide notifications using CSS rules. While this solution may require a slightly more technical approach, it effectively eliminates distractions."}]}

Firstly, the term \"climate change\" is now widely used to describe long-term shifts in weather conditions caused by human-generated greenhouse gases. However, this term lacks a sense of urgency and fails to convey the negative impacts associated with it. It can inadvertently support the narrative of climate skeptics who argue that natural climate fluctuations are responsible for current temperature increases. It is important to be aware of the connotations of these terms when discussing climate change.\n\nSecondly, the question \"Do you believe in climate change?\" is misleading and inappropriate. The overwhelming majority of research scientists agree that climate change is real, caused by human activity, and will have devastating consequences if immediate action is not taken. It is a proven scientific fact, not a matter of belief. Using the word \"believe\" perpetuates room for doubt and skepticism.\n\nThirdly, while climate goals and targets are crucial for addressing the climate emergency, focusing solely on facts, statistics, and targets can dehumanize the issue. These goals represent lives, and failing to meet them puts vulnerable communities at risk. It is essential to remember the human impact when discussing climate change in terms of goals and targets.\n\nLastly, framing climate action and policy as a \"fight against climate change\" creates a misleading narrative. Humans are responsible for climate change, and it is within our power to address and mitigate its effects. The focus should be on holding oil and gas companies accountable for their extraction and burning of fossil fuels, as well as urging politicians to enforce necessary regulations. The power to combat climate change lies in our hands, not in defeating an external force."}]}

However, some experts remain unconvinced. The study conducted by doctors at Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, involved 76 newly admitted COVID-19 patients who were split into two groups. One group received the standard treatment, including a combination of antibiotics and immunosuppressant drugs, while the second group received the standard treatment along with a drug designed to increase vitamin D levels in the blood. Among the 26 patients who received only standard care, half required intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to disease progression, and two of them died. However, among the 50 patients who received the additional vitamin D treatment, only one required ICU admission, and there were no deaths.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in October, is considered a pilot study that requires further investigation. Nevertheless, it is not the first piece of evidence linking vitamin D to a reduced risk of severe respiratory infections. Vitamin D has been shown to support innate antiviral immune responses while reducing harmful inflammatory responses. There is growing research suggesting that low levels of vitamin D could be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAdrian Martineau, a clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, explains that although the evidence is not definitive, it is likely that low levels of vitamin D increase the risk of severe COVID-19. Martineau, who was not involved in the Spanish study, has published several papers on the use of vitamin D for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. In a 2017 research review published in the BMJ, he and his co-authors concluded that taking a daily or weekly vitamin D supplement is associated with a reduced risk of respiratory infections, especially among individuals with low vitamin D levels.\n\nThe potential role of vitamin D in combating COVID-19 has garnered attention, partly due to Martineau's work on vitamin D and respiratory infections. Several studies have identified associations between low vitamin D levels and increased risks of COVID-19. For example, a study published in PLOS ONE on September 17 found a strong inverse association between blood levels of vitamin D and the risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings suggest that adequate levels of vitamin D may help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigate the severity of infections that do occur.\n\nThere are various mechanisms that may explain the benefits of vitamin D. For instance, vitamin D deficiency impairs the maturation of helpful white blood cells called macrophages, which play a crucial role in clearing viruses. Additionally, vitamin D may increase the levels of certain cell enzymes that help repel the coronavirus. There is also evidence suggesting that vitamin D may dampen elements of the immune system involved in the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19. These are just a few examples of how vitamin D may protect against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOverall, the research on vitamin D's potential benefits for COVID-19 is promising, but further studies are needed to fully understand its effectiveness. Nonetheless, considering the existing evidence, it is plausible that vitamin D supplementation could offer some level of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19."}]}

This goal does not entail reverting to primitive living conditions, but rather living in harmony with nature, even within urban environments. However, to achieve this, a transition period is necessary, with a key focus on restoring soil health. Over time, we have degraded our soil through intensive food production practices, neglecting the well-being of the land. To combat this, promoting biodiversity is crucial, as approximately one-quarter of Earth's species reside in the soil. Regrettably, both farmland and nature reserves have suffered from severe degradation worldwide. Compact soil layers have hindered the ability of soil organisms to breathe, while water storage has been compromised, resulting in plants with shallow roots. In my work with Dutch farmers, I emphasize the importance of preventing compaction by avoiding the use of heavy tractors. Without addressing this issue, all other attempts to foster biodiversity will prove futile. To restore soil health, we must utilize natural manure to provide essential nitrogen and phosphorus, along with copious amounts of decomposing organic matter to build up humus - the vital topsoil our planet desperately needs. Agriculture has played a significant role in land degradation, but mindful farming practices can aid in soil restoration. This is where cattle, chickens, and pigs come into play, as animals form an integral part of the natural ecosystem. Cattle, with their hooves, naturally solve compaction issues by trampling the soil, while chickens help control pests by consuming maggots found in cattle manure. Pigs, in turn, assist in soil aeration with their snouts. Allan Savory's holistic management approach advocates for an increase in cattle, as well as chickens and pigs, to graze grasslands, fertilize the soil, and allow for natural cycles of plant growth. I fully support Savory's view that environmental organizations should collaborate with cattle to restore degraded soils in nature reserves. Moreover, permaculture expert Geoff Lawton offers additional insights, emphasizing the need to assess each situation individually and determine the most effective means of collaboration between humans and animals. There is no doubt that animals are necessary for a healthy planet. While concerns about ammonia emissions from cows exist, healthy soil can absorb such emissions. Unfortunately, our soil is no longer healthy, thus I personally do not support a vegan lifestyle as a solution to our problems. Instead, during the transition period, we must work together as teams of people and animals to restore our planet's health, ensure adequate food supply, and sustain our economies. This requires finding new ways to coexist, producing human food, and restoring ecosystems."}]}

Allow me to present the unique value proposition of this offering. Instead of positioning it solely as a book, I am selling hard-to-find information that cannot be found elsewhere. The book serves as the medium through which this information is delivered. It is important to note that this book is exclusively available in physical form and cannot be purchased on platforms such as Amazon or in any brick-and-mortar bookstore. Additionally, it caters to a niche audience, limiting its appeal to a select few who can truly benefit from the information it contains. While these factors may seem counterintuitive, they contribute to the effectiveness of this product. By narrowing the target audience to individuals with specific needs and desires, I have found an underserved market segment. This audience must possess a strong passion or a desperate need for the content being offered. For example, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where I am selling a course on dog training. Competing in a saturated market, it is unlikely that I can command a premium price for a book that offers information already widely available. However, by narrowing the focus to a specific breed, such as catahoula leopard dogs, I can tap into a devoted but relatively small audience. With fewer providers catering to this niche, I can leverage this gap in the market to justify charging a higher price. Furthermore, by drilling down even further and targeting dog owners interested in competitive dog shows, I can create a highly focused marketing message that resonates with a smaller but highly passionate group of prospects. The limited availability of the product also plays a crucial role in driving up demand. By offering the information in a physical book format and emphasizing its limited printing of only five hundred copies, I create a sense of exclusivity. Owning this book becomes a mark of prestige, as the buyer will be one of the select few to possess this valuable information. To further enhance the value proposition, I provide additional bonuses beyond the book itself. These supplemental materials increase the perceived value of the offering, making the price an undeniable bargain. In fact, I may even offer exclusive premium bonuses for the first twenty buyers. This tailored approach can be applied to a targeted sales campaign aimed at owners of catahoula competition dogs, allowing for a highly personalized marketing message that addresses their specific needs and challenges. This level of specificity would be far more challenging to achieve when targeting all dog owners in general. Lastly, the advantage of targeting a smaller audience with a higher-priced product is the ability to provide a personal touch. I can express my gratitude by sending handwritten thank-you notes to each purchaser, a gesture that would be impractical with lower-priced e-books."}]}

This shift in values is reflected in changes in artistic styles and the preferences of the public. These changes are not only influenced by natural factors, but also by historical circumstances.\n\nDespite the negative impact of mass-produced art on the originality of a work of art, Benjamin argued that the uniqueness of a piece is inseparable from its connection to tradition. This traditional context distinguishes the original work from reproductions. Benjamin also observed that the mechanical reproduction of art freed it from its reliance on ritual, thereby increasing its social value when exhibited in public.\n\nArt exhibitions have transitioned from being solely enjoyed privately by the owner, typically high-end art, to becoming a practice appreciated by the public in gallery settings. Benjamin discussed the various social functions of an artwork, highlighting two main types: cult value and exhibition value. Cult value emphasizes the significance of religious objects that are often not visible to the general public, while exhibition value pertains to works of art intended for public appreciation. The diminished cult value of a religious artifact increases its exhibition value, as it can be more easily displayed and shared with a wider audience.\n\nThe mechanical reproduction of art diminishes its cult value by removing it from a fixed, private space and placing it in a mobile, public space. This allows the artwork to be seen by many spectators in a museum setting. Benjamin noted that the photographic image, for the first time, surpasses cult value and highlights its exhibition value. In prioritizing exhibition value, art takes on new functions that may be seen as incidental to the original intentions of the artist.\n\nIn the medium of cinema, cult value does not apply to the motion picture itself, as the audience's identification is primarily with the camera and the actor. This shift in perspective places the audience in a critical position, rather than one of reverent appreciation. As a result, the cult value of the film recedes, and the audience's approach to the movie requires little attention.\n\nOverall, Benjamin's analysis emphasizes the dynamic relationship between art, society, and the changing values that shape artistic production and appreciation."}]}

[10] private accumulation had a strong tendency to weak growth and high levels of excess capacity and unemployment/underemployment , which could , however , be countered in part by such exogenous factors as state spending ( military and civilian ) , epoch-making technological innovations ( for example , the automobile in its expansionary period ) , and the growth of finance . [11] in the 1980s and 1990s magdoff and sweezy argued that a financial explosion of long duration was lifting the economy , but this would eventually compound the contradictions of the system , producing ever bigger speculative bubbles , and leading eventually to a resumption of overt stagnation ."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "Secular stagnation refers to a prolonged lack of demand in a market economy. In the past, a strong economy with high GDP growth and low unemployment would result in inflation in wages and products. However, an economy experiencing secular stagnation behaves as if it is operating below capacity, even during periods of apparent economic growth where inflation is not present.\n\nIn a healthy economy, if household savings surpass business investments, interest rates decrease. Lower interest rates encourage spending and investment, which helps balance savings and investments. However, an economy facing secular stagnation may require interest rates to go below zero to achieve this balance. The surplus of savings over investment can lead to price appreciation in financial assets or real estate. For instance, the United States experienced low unemployment but low inflation before the Great Recession, during which a significant housing bubble formed.\n\nThe concept of secular stagnation dates back to the Great Depression, when economists were concerned that the United States had entered a prolonged period of low growth. Various factors can contribute to secular stagnation by either increasing savings or reducing investment. Households paying off debt, known as deleveraging, lead to increased savings and reduced spending. Businesses respond to the lack of demand by investing less, which was a significant factor in the slow GDP growth in the U.S. from 2009 to 2012 following the Great Recession. Income inequality is another potential cause as it shifts more money to the wealthy, who tend to save rather than spend, thus increasing savings and potentially driving up asset prices. Aging populations, which spend less per capita, and a slowdown in productivity can also diminish investment.\n\nCentral banks face a challenging dilemma. Should they raise interest rates to curb inflation, assuming the economy is experiencing a cyclical boom, or should they take a more stimulating approach, considering the possibility of secular stagnation even during periods of temporary economic growth?\n\nHarry Magdoff and Paul Sweezy, former economic advisor and Harvard economics professor respectively, provided an analysis of stagnation and financialization in the 1980s. They argued, based on the work of Keynes, Hansen, Micha\u0142 Kalecki, and Marx, that stagnation or slow growth was the norm for mature, monopolistic or oligopolistic economies, with rapid growth being the exception. Private accumulation tended to result in weak growth, excess capacity, and unemployment, which could be partially countered by factors like state spending, technological innovations, and financial growth. In the 1980s and 1990s, Magdoff and Sweezy contended that a long-lasting financial explosion was boosting the economy, but they predicted that it would eventually exacerbate the system's contradictions, leading to larger speculative bubbles and a return to overt stagnation."}]}

[51][52][53] a country ' s level of human capital is difficult to measure since it is created at home , at school , and on the job . economists have attempted to measure human capital using numerous proxies , including the population ' s level of literacy , its level of numeracy , its level of book production/capita , its average level of formal schooling , its average test score on international tests , and its cumulative depreciated investment in formal schooling . the most commonly-used measure of human capital is the level ( average years ) of school attainment in a country , building upon the data development of robert barro and jong-wha lee . [54] this measure is widely used because barro and lee provide data for numerous countries in five-year intervals for a long period of time . one problem with the schooling attainment measure is that the amount of human capital acquired in a year of schooling is not the same at all levels of schooling and is not the same in all countries . this measure also presumes that human capital is only developed in formal schooling , contrary to the extensive evidence that families , neighborhoods , peers , and health also contribute to the development of human capital . despite these potential limitations , theodore breton has shown that this measure can represent human capital in log-linear growth models because across countries gdp/adult has a log-linear relationship to average years of schooling , which is consistent with the log-linear relationship between workers ' personal incomes and years of schooling in the mincer model . eric hanushek and dennis kimko introduced measures of students ' mathematics and science skills from international assessments into growth analysis . they found that this measure of human capital was very significantly related to economic growth . eric hanushek and smith have extended this analysis . theodore breton shows that the correlation between economic growth and students ' average test scores in hanushek and w\u00f6\u00dfmann ' s analyses is actually due to the relationship in countries with less than eight years of schooling . he shows that economic growth is not correlated with average scores in more educated countries .

[62] mortality decline triggers greater investments in individual human capital and an increase in economic growth . matteo cervellati and uwe sunde[63] and rodrigo . r soares[64] consider frameworks in which mortality decline has an influence on parents to have fewer children and to provide quality education for those children , as a result instituting an economic-demographic transition ."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "Many studies on economic growth emphasize the significant role of human capital, which refers to the skills possessed by a country's population or workforce. Human capital is a key component in both neoclassical and endogenous growth models. However, measuring a country's level of human capital is challenging as it is developed through various avenues such as home, school, and work.\n\nEconomists have attempted to measure human capital using different indicators, including literacy rates, numeracy levels, book production per capita, average years of formal schooling, average test scores on international assessments, and cumulative investment in formal education. The most commonly used measure of human capital is the average years of schooling in a country, based on data compiled by Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee. Their data covers numerous countries over an extended period.\n\nOne limitation of the schooling attainment measure is that the amount of human capital acquired through a year of schooling varies across different levels of education and among countries. Additionally, this measure assumes that human capital is solely developed through formal schooling, disregarding evidence that factors like family, neighborhood, peers, and health also contribute to its development.\n\nDespite these limitations, Theodore Breton has demonstrated that the average years of schooling measure can effectively represent human capital in log-linear growth models. He found that there is a log-linear relationship between a country's GDP per adult and average years of schooling, which aligns with the log-linear relationship between workers' personal incomes and years of schooling in the Mincer model.\n\nEric Hanushek and Dennis Kimko introduced measures of students' mathematics and science skills from international assessments into growth analysis. They discovered a significant relationship between this measure of human capital and economic growth. Eric Hanushek and Smith expanded on this analysis. However, Theodore Breton argues that the correlation between economic growth and average test scores in Hanushek and W\u00f6\u00dfmann's analyses is primarily driven by countries with less than eight years of schooling. In more educated countries, economic growth is not correlated with average test scores.\n\nHanushek and Smith also investigated the causal relationship between knowledge capital and economic growth. They demonstrated that the level of students' cognitive skills can explain the slow growth in Latin America and the rapid growth in East Asia.\n\nJoerg Baten and Jan Luiten van Zanden utilized book production per capita as a measure of sophisticated literacy capabilities. They found that countries with high levels of human capital formation in the 18th century were able to initiate or participate in the industrialization process of the 19th century. In contrast, countries with low levels of human capital formation, including present-day less developed countries like India, Indonesia, and China, were unable to do so.\n\nThe concept of health is approached from Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's capability approach, which considers it as the opportunity for individuals to biologically develop to their full potential throughout their lives, rather than just the absence of illness. It is established that human capital is a vital asset for economic growth, but it can only contribute effectively if the population is healthy and well-nourished. One crucial aspect of health is the mortality rate and how changes in it can impact the labor supply in developing economies.\n\nMortality decline incentivizes greater investments in individual human capital and leads to increased economic growth. Matteo Cervellati, Uwe Sunde, and Rodrigo R. Soares have explored frameworks in which the decline in mortality rates influences parents to have fewer children and provide them with quality education. This sets in motion an economic-demographic transition."}]}

Chemists in the 19th century possessed less knowledge about chemistry compared to their counterparts in the 20th century, who in turn knew less than chemists in the 21st century. Today's chemists anticipate that future chemists will surpass their current knowledge. Historically, scientific progress was often depicted as a steady accumulation of knowledge, where true theories replaced incorrect beliefs. However, some contemporary interpretations, like Thomas Kuhn's, present the history of science as a competition between different paradigms or conceptual systems, influenced by intellectual, cultural, economic, and political trends. These interpretations, however, face opposition as they portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incompatible paradigms, rather than leading to genuine progress, but rather an illusion of progress. The question of whether other intellectual disciplines progress in the same manner as the sciences is a subject of debate. For example, one might assume that modern historians possess more knowledge about global history than their ancient counterparts, such as Herodotus. However, knowledge can be lost over time, or the criteria for determining valuable knowledge may change. Similarly, there is a significant disagreement regarding whether fields like philosophy make progress or aim to accumulate knowledge in the same manner as the sciences. Social progress is often measured by increases in GDP, although other factors are also relevant. When there is an imbalance between economic growth and social progress, it impedes further economic advancement and can result in political instability. Countries that fail to address human needs, develop social capital, and create opportunities for their citizens also experience hindered economic growth and social progress. In Italy, the belief that progress in science and technology would offer solutions for societal issues was closely tied to the nationalism that unified the country in 1860. The Prime Minister of Piedmont, Camillo Cavour, envisioned railways as a pivotal factor in modernizing and unifying the Italian peninsula. Following the formation of the new Kingdom of Italy in 1861, efforts were made to expedite modernization and industrialization that had already begun in the northern regions but were slower to reach the papal states, central Italy, and the southern areas such as Sicily and Sardinia. The government aimed to address the underdevelopment of these regions, enhance the size and quality of the newly formed Italian army to compete on a global scale, and legislate in favor of public education to combat illiteracy, upgrade the teaching profession, improve existing schools, and allocate funds for social hygiene and physical and moral regeneration of the population."}]}

The presence of large peninsulas and natural barriers, such as mountains and straits, provided defensible borders and encouraged the formation of separate political entities. In contrast, China's geography facilitated political unity, with a smoother coastline and a heartland dominated by the Yellow and Yangtze river valleys. The topographical structure of Europe, including mountain chains, coasts, and major marshes, created boundaries where expanding states could meet and pause. This sense of shared geography led European countries to feel a sense of unity.\n\nEurope's political fragmentation was also influenced by the presence of distinct geographical cores and the location of the Eurasian steppe. The presence of mountain ranges allowed for the development of multiple geographical nuclei that could serve as the foundation for future states. The Eurasian steppe posed a threat to sedentary populations, as steppe nomads, such as Genghis Khan and the Mongols, had the potential to invade neighboring areas during periods of drought or cold weather. This threat stimulated China, which was located near the steppe, to build a strong and unified state.\n\nIn his book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\" Jared Diamond argues that advanced cultures outside of Europe developed in areas that were conducive to large, isolated empires. These conditions allowed for the persistence of technological and social stagnation. For example, in 1432, the Xuande emperor of China outlawed the construction of ocean-going ships, despite China's leadership in maritime technology at the time. In contrast, Christopher Columbus obtained sponsorship from Queen Isabella I of Castile for his expedition, highlighting the willingness of European governments to support economic and technological progress. This created an environment where governments that suppressed progress were quickly out-competed or corrected their mistakes. As a result, Europe experienced more rapid internal superpower changes compared to other regions in Eurasia.\n\nJustin Yifu Lin argues that China's large population size was beneficial for technological advancements before the 14th century. However, population size was not a significant factor in the kind of technological advancements that led to the industrial revolution. Early advancements relied on learning by doing, where population size facilitated the spread of advances across large political units. The industrial revolution, on the other hand, was driven by experimentation and theory, where population size played a lesser role.\n\nBefore Europe made strides in technology and trade, education was a significant concern. By 1800, literacy rates in the Netherlands were at 68%, while rates in Britain and Belgium were at 50%. In contrast, non-European societies would see literacy rates rise in the 20th century. As the industrial revolution progressed, skilled labor became more in demand, and factors such as education, training, skills, and health played a primary role in worker productivity.\n\nEconomic historian Joel Mokyr argues that Europe's political fragmentation allowed for the flourishing of heterodox ideas. Entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues, and heretics could easily move to a neighboring state if their ideas and activities were suppressed in their home state. This distinguishes Europe from technologically advanced, large unitary empires, such as China. While China possessed both a printing press and movable type, the industrial revolution occurred in Europe. Europe's political fragmentation, coupled with an integrated market for ideas, enabled European intellectuals to communicate in Latin, share a common intellectual heritage, and participate in the pan-European institution of the republic of letters.\n\nHistorian Niall Ferguson attributes this divergence to the development of six \"killer apps\" in the West, which were largely absent in other parts of the world in 1500. These apps include competition, the scientific method, the rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism, and the work ethic. These factors contributed to Europe's unique path of development."}]}

From the American Revolution onwards, there have been concerns in Canada about American dominance or annexation. However, the War of 1812, with invasions from both sides, resulted in unchanged borders and demilitarization of the border and the Great Lakes region. Since then, apart from minor unsuccessful raids, peace has prevailed.\n\nThe fear of American takeover influenced the Canadian Confederation in 1867 and Canada's rejection of free trade in 1911, as Britain decided to disengage. During World War II and the Cold War, military collaboration between the two nations was close, both bilaterally through NORAD and multilaterally through NATO. Significant trade and migration, as well as shared popular and elite culture, have generated closer ties, especially after the signing of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988.\n\nCanada and the United States share the longest border in the world, spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi), and have significant military interoperability. Recent challenges include trade disputes, environmental concerns, Canadian worries about oil exports, illegal immigration, and terrorism threats. However, trade has continued to expand, particularly after the implementation of the 1988 FTA, the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which have progressively integrated the two economies.\n\nCooperation on various fronts, such as facilitating the flow of goods, services, and people across borders, establishing joint border inspection agencies, and harmonizing regulations, further strengthens the American-Canadian alliance.

It became significant during the Klondike gold rush when Canadian miners had to access the goldfields through American ports. The dispute was resolved through arbitration, but it left Canadians disillusioned with Britain, realizing that Britain prioritized its relations with the United States over those with Canada. In 1907, there was another minor controversy when the USS Nashville sailed into the Great Lakes via Canada without Canadian permission. To avoid future embarrassments, the International Boundary Waters Treaty was signed in 1909, and the International Joint Commission was established to manage the Great Lakes and keep them disarmed. It was later amended during World War II to allow the construction and training of warships."}]}

Each year, we encourage all eligible employees and retirees to carefully review their health, dental, vision, and dependent care needs and consider making changes to or enrolling in one of the available benefit programs. Open season is a unique opportunity to make choices that you generally cannot make at any other time of the year. It is important to remember that not all health, dental, or vision plans are the same. Open season is all about exercising your ability to select the benefits that best meet the needs of both you and your family. You have until December 12 to make your benefit decisions. To learn more about the federal benefits open season, please follow this link to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program.\n\nThe FEHB program covers over 8.2 million employees, retirees, and their families nationwide. For 2017, there will be 245 health plans available, with 15 of them offered nationwide. It is worth noting that all FEHB plans now offer the opportunity to enroll in a self plus one enrollment type. This option allows you to provide coverage for yourself and one eligible family member, such as a spouse or child. If you did not take advantage of self plus one last year, now is the perfect time to consider it.\n\nAs we celebrate Veterans Day and honor the brave men and women who have served our nation, let us also reflect on the challenges they face as they transition to civilian life. Veterans like Christopher, Georgia, and Julien have all encountered difficulties finding fulfilling employment after their military service. President Obama recognized these challenges and issued Executive Order 13518 to prioritize the employment of veterans in the federal service. Federal employees care about a wide range of issues, including animal welfare, art and music programs, support for veterans, the environment, cancer research, and soup kitchens. Through the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), you can contribute to causes that hold special meaning for you and your family. The CFC is the largest and most successful workplace philanthropic giving program in the world, with nearly 4 million federal employees donating almost $178 million in 2015 alone. Since its inception, federal employees have contributed over $8 billion to help those in need. Participating in the CFC is voluntary and easy, offering a variety of giving methods including cash, check, credit card, payroll deduction, paper pledge form, or online pledge.\n\nDomestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking (DVSAs) are unfortunately significant problems that impact individuals, families, and communities. It is likely that at some point in our careers, we will have a colleague who has experienced or is experiencing such violence. The effects of DVSAs extend beyond the home and affect everyone in the workplace. To create a safe and supportive work environment, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have introduced an online training program to educate federal employees and managers on this sensitive topic. Our goal is to provide all employees with the knowledge and tools necessary to address DVSAs effectively."}]}

He is committed to building a strong base of fans and has been encouraged by recent signs of growth. Reagins believes that when individuals have a positive experience with the sport, they are more likely to become fans. MLB's popularity has been expanding thanks to platforms like TikTok and YouTube, which have introduced the sport to a wider audience. To cater to the shorter attention spans of today's youth, MLB has implemented new rules to speed up the pace of play, such as the introduction of the pitch clock. As a result, the average game time this season has been reduced to 2 hours and 38 minutes, down from 3 hours and 3 minutes last year and 3 hours and 10 minutes in 2021. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledges the importance of attracting younger audiences and highlights that national and local TV viewership among teens ages 12-17 has increased by 11% compared to last year. Additionally, 86% of individuals ages 18-24 and 25-34 have expressed a greater likelihood of watching MLB games due to the rule changes. This season, MLB parks are seeing increased attendance, with an average of 29,277 attendees, a 9% increase compared to 2022. Reagins recognizes the shift in how young people consume baseball, favoring shorter bursts of content. This has prompted MLB to adapt its strategies to attract new fans. The league's primary focus is ensuring that people are engaging with the game, whether through highlights or full-length matches. However, it is possible that the emphasis on highlight-reel moments has diminished the bond between young fans and the concept of loyalty to a specific team. For instance, twelve-year-old Grayson Leinart from Waco, Michigan, enjoys watching baseball highlights, finding them more captivating than complete games. This sentiment is not unique to Grayson, as many young fans attending games at Bowman Field are likely to be simultaneously watching captivating defensive plays from previous games on their smartphones. Last year, the Orioles and Red Sox were warmly welcomed by little leaguers at the airport, who eagerly collected autographs and watched early Little League World Series games. Nationals first baseman Dominic Smith, a co-founder of the Baseball Generations Foundation, a nonprofit that supports underprivileged youth in baseball, wishes he could spend more time at the Little League World Series. He believes it is crucial for kids to understand that major leaguers are just like them, which can inspire them to work hard and pursue their dreams. As a child, Washington's manager, Dave Martinez, prioritized playing as much baseball as possible, regardless of the format. However, he is excited about this trip to Williamsport and the opportunity to connect with the next generation of baseball fans. Martinez is eager to learn about what motivates kids nowadays and why they love the game. His insights could prove valuable for MLB's decision-makers."}]}

This was due to COVID-19 outbreaks among migrant farm workers across Canada, particularly in Southern Ontario. The outbreaks and their impact on the food supply highlight the importance and vulnerability of migrant workers, many of whom are hired through Canada's Temporary Foreign Worker Program.\n\nThe Temporary Foreign Worker Program, which is scheduled to be changed in September, allows employers to hire foreign workers when qualified Canadians are not available. This program has become increasingly popular, with a significant increase in successful applications in recent years. However, there have also been numerous allegations of abuse, including unsafe working and living conditions. Temporary workers often endure long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, while living in cramped quarters provided by their employers. These conditions increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks and other health hazards.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for the well-being of these workers that the changes to the program in September do not exacerbate the existing abuse issues. The federal government insists that the alteration, known as the Recognized Employer Pilot, will actually address this concern. According to Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, the pilot will reduce administrative burdens for employers who prioritize worker protection. They will be eligible for three-year permits instead of the current 18 months. The change will initially apply to agriculture employers and later to all other sectors starting in January. Rewarding responsible employers could help protect workers and streamline paperwork. Ottawa has also pledged to conduct more thorough assessments before issuing permits.\n\nHowever, a three-year timeframe is ample for workplace and living conditions to deteriorate significantly. Government inspectors are responsible for monitoring employers' compliance with regulations, but their oversight has been insufficient. In response to the COVID outbreaks among farm workers, the federal auditor general, Karen Hogan, criticized inspectors for failing to ensure employers adhered to regulations. To ensure the success of the pilot program, improved and vigilant monitoring of employers' compliance with safety standards throughout the three-year period is imperative.\n\nNevertheless, even with enhanced monitoring, the fundamental issue that enables abuse remains: the power imbalance between employers and workers. This imbalance is a result of employer-specific work permits and the precarious immigration status of the workers. Employer-specific permits require workers to remain with their initial employer, leaving them with the impossible choice of enduring abuse or facing unemployment. In response to this, Ottawa introduced the Vulnerable Worker Open Work Permit Program, which allows abused workers to move to a different employer. However, workers are often reluctant to complain out of fear of deportation or retaliation from their employers. Moreover, by limiting open permits to those who have already experienced abuse, the program inadvertently treats abuse as a rite of passage for gaining access to the benefits of an open permit.\n\nIn conclusion, while the changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program are intended to address some of the existing issues, it is crucial to ensure that they do not exacerbate the abuse faced by migrant workers. This requires robust monitoring of employer compliance with safety standards throughout the three-year pilot period. Additionally, the power imbalance between employers and workers must be addressed through reforms that provide greater protection for vulnerable workers, including more accessible options for changing employers and addressing the fear of reporting abuse."}]}

After seasonal adjustments, the index for July rose by 2.4% from June, marking the fourth consecutive monthly rise. This recent growth in the home price composite index has helped to recover some of the decline experienced since its peak in April 2022, when higher interest rates deterred potential buyers. Douglas Porter, Chief Economist at the Bank of Montreal, stated that the significant declines seen throughout 2022 are now being reversed. It's worth noting that the Teranet-National Bank index tends to lag behind other housing market measures due to its more detailed nature. Porter added that other measures are indicating some softening in the market over the summer, and he anticipates that this trend will also be reflected in the Teranet-National Bank index going forward. He emphasized that this may be the last period of strong growth in home prices for a while. On a positive note, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported that July home sales demonstrated the largest annualized increase in over two years. However, they remained relatively stable compared to June, indicating signs of the national housing market stabilizing during the summer. National Bank of Canada economist Daren King wrote in the report that prices could continue to rise in the third quarter of the year, supported by strong demographic growth and low supply. However, King also pointed out that affordability may deteriorate due to recent interest rate hikes and a less buoyant economic context, which could pose a headwind for house prices thereafter. Porter agreed with King's assessment that the housing market will face more challenges as the year progresses, despite the support from high immigration. He mentioned that expectations for interest rates are shifting towards a longer period of higher rates, which will put pressure on the housing market in the long run. Porter acknowledged that mortgage interest costs impacting the consumer price index are an unfortunate side effect of the central bank's fight against inflation. Nevertheless, he emphasized the importance of considering the overall picture, which shows a decrease in inflation and underlying inflation over the past year. In July, eight of the eleven markets in the Teranet-National Bank Composite Index saw price increases, with Halifax experiencing the most significant gain at 4.9%. Vancouver and Toronto also experienced notable increases of 3.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Conversely, prices decreased by 1.2% in Quebec City, 0.9% in Montreal, and 0.3% in Calgary.

In collaboration with Genesis Flight College in Collingwood, Ontario, Flair's new airline pilot training program aims to significantly shorten the time it takes for new pilots in Canada to secure jobs flying large commercial jets. Candidates with no prior flying experience can enter the program and, within 18 months, become first officers on Flair Airlines' fleet of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\n\nThe demand for pilots has been steadily increasing due to factors such as an aging workforce and the rise of new discount airlines that are increasing pressure on the labor pool. Flair Airlines itself has experienced rapid growth, expanding from three aircraft to 21 Boeing 737s and serving over 30 cities across Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing labor challenges, causing delays and disruptions in pilot training and prompting experienced pilots to seek more stable job opportunities in other industries. According to Oliver Wyman, an international consultancy firm, the North American aviation industry could face a shortage of 30,000 pilots by 2032 if no action is taken.\n\nGrey Cooper, Manager of Pilot Training at Flair, believes that the current circumstances present the ideal opportunity to introduce a targeted training program that can produce high-quality pilots tailored to the company's needs. While Transport Canada regulations mandate a minimum of 250 hours of flying time to qualify for an airline transport pilot license, major airlines have traditionally preferred candidates with far more experience. Pilots would often spend years flying smaller planes on regional and northern routes before transitioning to larger jets. However, as the availability of experienced pilots diminishes, airlines have started hiring individuals with less experience, sometimes as little as two years flying smaller planes. Flair's program adheres to Transport Canada's regulatory requirements and upholds the highest industry standards for training and safety.\n\nFlair has implemented a thorough screening process to evaluate applicants' aptitude and competence before entering the program. Additionally, the airline has partnered with technology company CTS Aero to integrate state-of-the-art virtual reality tools and flight simulators into the training program. While Flair is the first to introduce this concept in Canada, similar programs exist in Europe, where individuals with no experience can swiftly secure positions on Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 jets upon completion. By adopting proven systems from around the world, Flair aims to provide aspiring pilots in Canada with a streamlined path to employment.\n\nFlair plans to welcome its first group of ten aspiring pilots in January 2024. Accepted students will receive a conditional offer of employment and seamlessly transition into the airline upon graduation."}]}

While many initially attributed this to a random occurrence or an \"act of God,\" some are questioning whether these deaths could have been prevented through better tree maintenance. Recent reports shed light on the city's tree maintenance program, revealing potential flaws and shortcomings.\n\nPrior to Nadimi's unfortunate accident, a resident had alerted city workers about the dangerous branch on two separate occasions. Despite this, the branch remained intact until it claimed a life. Following the incident, the city removed the tree and identified 16 other trees for removal in the park, while 21 received maintenance, including pruning. Despite the city's claim of handling around 40,000 tree maintenance calls annually, conducting over 25,000 inspections, and pruning more than 20,000 trees, arborists have raised concerns about outdated assessment methods and excessive pruning of mature trees.\n\nArborist and urban forestry educator Todd Irvine expressed concern about trees being pruned in a manner that deviates from recognized arboricultural standards, potentially jeopardizing their health and structural integrity. The practice of over-pruning, also known as \"lions tailing,\" weakens trees and increases the likelihood of limb drop during storms. However, other arborists are not convinced that this was the primary issue in this particular case.\n\nIt is evident, in light of recent events, that the city must reassess its tree maintenance practices. With an estimated 4.1 million trees on public land and 6.1 million on private lands, proper care for Toronto's trees is essential. This tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the significance of tending to trees, particularly as we face increasingly severe storms due to climate change. The city witnessed a notable rise in storm-related calls in 2022, surpassing previous years. Investing in the adequate maintenance of trees is crucial, not only for the environment but also for the safety of park visitors and those who seek solace beneath the sheltering branches of these majestic beings."}]}

The BMJ argued that Canada failed to learn from previous experiences and investigations, resulting in the most vulnerable populations, including those in long-term care homes and marginalized communities, bearing the brunt of illness and death. The country's response was also described as uncoordinated and falling short of its promises to share vaccines globally. The editorial headline expressed disappointment rather than anger, stating that the world expected more from Canada.\n\nBy July 18, over 53,000 Canadians had died from the virus, with lower-income individuals experiencing higher mortality rates. The report emphasized that Canada's adherence to lockdown measures and high vaccination coverage played a crucial role in preventing greater calamity. Canadian researchers who authored the series called for an independent national inquiry into the COVID-19 response, a sentiment supported by most Canadians according to polls.\n\nHowever, the idea of a formal inquiry may raise concerns, especially considering the prolonged debates in Ottawa regarding an inquiry into foreign interference. Some may argue that much of the diagnosis is already known through various existing investigations and studies. Nonetheless, there is a strong case for a focused, independent, evidence-based examination of the response to COVID-19, which can generate practical recommendations for future health crises.\n\nThe absence of a fact-based inquiry leaves room for non-scientific voices with different agendas to dominate the narrative. It is undeniable that Canada's imperfect response resulted in loss of life and financial consequences. To improve future preparedness, an inquiry would provide a comprehensive roadmap for reform. Actions should include building stockpiles of medical equipment and protective gear, streamlining mass vaccination plans, refining economic supports, protecting long-term care facilities, addressing social inequities, and improving planning, preparation, and communication.\n\nPrevious investigations have emphasized the need to strengthen leadership, coordination, surveillance, risk reduction, and supply stockpiling. The Ontario Long-Term Care Commission, for example, highlighted chronic understaffing, underfunding, structural deficiencies, and inadequate regulation in long-term care homes due to decades of neglect. The importance of the precautionary principle, as emphasized by Justice Archie Campbell in the 2003 SARS epidemic report, should guide decision-making, prioritizing swift action over waiting for scientific certainty.\n\nCertain issues raised by the BMJ are recurring, such as politicians expressing ambitious goals but delivering limited results while facing other crises, and the inherent challenges faced by a large federal nation like Canada in providing fully coherent answers. The key challenge is to keep pandemic preparedness at the forefront of government priorities and maintain both focus and determination. This requires political commitment, as the scientific case for the high costs of failure and the inevitability of another pandemic is clear. A formal inquiry would provide guidance on how Canada can improve its response."}]}

This delay has made it challenging to provide accurate property tax forecasts for investors who have postponed or cancelled their projects due to the uncertainty. Furthermore, municipalities may be forced to increase tax rates to compensate for outdated property values. Raymond Williams, Chair of Tax Policy at the Canadian Property Tax Association, emphasized that when assessed values do not reflect current market trends, municipalities have no choice but to raise the tax rate to generate additional revenue. Williams, who is also a commercial property tax consultant at Altus Group, stressed the importance of addressing this issue.\n\nThese concerns arise following a Toronto Star investigation into Ontario's property assessment system, which revealed that homeowners are paying unfair shares of property tax due to inconsistent assessments by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC). During reassessments, MPAC assigns new values to properties based on various factors such as location, size, and construction quality, using a valuation date set by the government. Municipalities rely on these assessment values to calculate property tax payments. In light of these issues, the province recently updated the assessment act.\n\nMPAC, a publicly funded non-profit organization responsible for assessing over 5.5 million properties across Ontario, is required to provide an updated assessment roll each year. This includes changes such as permitted additions, renovations, and new constructions. In 2022 alone, MPAC added over $37.8 billion to municipal rolls through assessments of new construction and renovated properties. Municipalities pay over $200 million annually for this service, with the City of Toronto alone paying $46.5 million last year.\n\nMembers of the coalition argue that MPAC's assessment values have become difficult to comprehend for property owners. The longer the gap between reassessments, the harder it is for homeowners to determine the true current value of their properties. This link between reassessment delays and inaccurate assessments has been supported by research, including a policy brief from the U.S.-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. The investigation by the Toronto Star also revealed disparities in property tax payments, with owners of more affordable properties paying more than their fair share while owners of expensive properties pay comparatively less.\n\nIn response to the Star's reporting, Mayor-elect Olivia Chow and the NDP opposition have called for a review of MPAC's assessment system. MPAC, however, disagrees with the findings and claims that internal and external reviews have confirmed its adherence to international standards. They criticize the Star's reporting as inflammatory and misleading to property owners regarding the quality and accuracy of their assessments."}]}

He had been guaranteed an hourly wage of nearly $35 for his work in tiling and other renovations at schools and retirement homes in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). However, after accumulating numerous hours of unpaid labor, Juravliov recognized the need to take action. In the fall of 2022, he filed a claim with the provincial labor ministry, leading to an order for his employer to pay him $32,000 in stolen wages by December.\n\nIn an effort to shed light on the issue, The Star obtained detailed information on successful claims for workplace violations and the recovery of unpaid wages from April 2020 to December 2022. Parkdale Community Legal Service and Downtown Legal Services also requested this data and shared their findings with The Star. During this period, over 8,400 Ontario workers filed successful claims for workplace violations, including failure to receive overtime, minimum wage, severance, termination pay, or other entitlements. The internal records indicate that these workers were owed over $36 million in total. However, by the end of 2022, the government had only collected just under 40% of that amount through its enforcement efforts, according to The Star's analysis.\n\nAfter The Star's analysis was published, a ministry spokesperson disagreed with their findings, asserting that the amount of recovered wages was \"far higher.\" The spokesperson explained that the internal records analyzed by The Star did not encompass complete data on instances where companies paid orders to compensate workers, which is a tool employed to collect unpaid wages. The ministry stated that it couldn't provide this information due to how it organizes enforcement data, despite The Star previously obtaining such figures through a freedom-of-information request.\n\nMary Gellatly, a community legal worker, expressed concern over the government's inability to track this crucial data, as it hinders open and informed discussions about the enforcement of workplace minimum standards.\n\nWhen workers file claims for wage theft, several outcomes are possible, with some processes being more time-consuming than others. Employers can pay their workers before the ministry issues a ruling, allowing for the resolution and withdrawal of the claim. The parties involved can also reach a settlement before the ministry makes any findings, typically resulting in workers receiving some, but not necessarily all, of their owed wages. Alternatively, if workers pursue their claim and the ministry rules in their favor, employers can choose to comply voluntarily and pay the owed wages. However, the majority of employers opt not to do so, as indicated by the ministry's data obtained by The Star. Between 2020 and 2022, less than 10% of workers' unpaid wages were recovered through voluntary compliance.\n\nIn cases where employers do not comply, an order to pay is issued, requiring them to fulfill their payment obligations within 30 days. These orders to pay are a crucial aspect of enforcement, but advocates have long been critical of their success rate, as previous labor ministry data revealed that only 37% of employers fully honored these orders. Unfortunately, in response to inquiries for this article, the labor ministry stated that it could not provide a breakdown of the amount of money successfully collected through orders to pay due to how it stores enforcement data. Consequently, it is challenging to gauge the extent to which the labor ministry employs its enforcement tools to compel employers to pay unpaid wages.\n\nWhen orders to pay fail, the finance ministry takes over the collection efforts."}]}

According to internal data obtained through freedom of information legislation, the province discovered a total of $36 million owed to workers between 2020 and 2022. Through voluntary compliance, approximately $3 million was recovered. When employers did not comply, resulting cases were sent to collections, leading to an additional $9 million being recouped, as per Ministry of Finance data shared with the star. However, the Ministry of Finance deemed $23 million as \"uncollectable\" during the same timeframe. In total, the province recovered close to $13 million out of the $36 million owed as of December 2022, as indicated by the data. Please note that this data does not include any money recovered after that date.\n\nIt is important to note that the Labour Ministry has altered how it counts the amount it recovers. It now includes settled and withdrawn claims in the sum it reports as having been recovered on behalf of workers, a practice that did not exist prior to 2017. Between 2020 and 2022, settlements resulted in workers receiving approximately $10.8 million based on the data obtained by the star. However, settlements and withdrawn claims do not involve ministry officials determining the legally owed amount to workers. Therefore, the star's analysis treated these categories separately, as a recovery rate cannot be determined without an assessment of the initial entitlement.\n\nPrevious academic research has indicated that settlement outcomes tend to be less favorable for claimants compared to situations where a case officer completes an investigation and issues a decision. Taking into account settled and withdrawn claims, as well as voluntary compliance, inspections, and collections by the Ministry of Finance, the Labour Ministry states that a total of $60 million was recovered for workers over the past three fiscal years. However, this calculation seems to be inconsistent. The ministry provided a breakdown of each collection method in an FOI release to the legal clinics, and the total sum of collections only amounts to $39.6 million. The ministry did not offer an explanation for the $20.8-million discrepancy, other than stating that the data does not include money collected through orders to pay due to the inability to provide that information. \n\nFurthermore, the ministry's breakdown claims that its colleagues at the Ministry of Finance recovered $8.6 million through collections in the fiscal years 2020/21 and 2021/22, which is $1.8 million more than what the Ministry of Finance reports collecting. Both ministries have not commented on this discrepancy. In response, Sydney Dubin, spokesperson for the Labour Minister, stated that it is vital for everyone in Ontario to be fairly compensated for their work and that the government utilizes all available avenues to recover stolen wages. The statement affirms that those who try to exploit workers are not welcome to operate in the province."}]}

The assessed value of the property was around $4.6 million, but it sold for millions more. However, gathering this information for this specific property, as well as over 20,000 others in Toronto, was a complex task that took nearly two years. In many cities in the United States, property assessment and sale data is readily available to the public on government websites. Researchers have found that these assessments often overtax the working class and favor the wealthy. Unfortunately, in Ontario, the same data is heavily protected. The Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC), which is responsible for valuating properties in Ontario, has argued successfully that property owners should not have access to larger volumes of assessment data and calculation details due to potential harm to their economic interests. MPAC claims that their work is accurate, fair, and easily accessible to the public. However, when we requested a copy of Toronto's digital assessment roll, we were informed that the licensing agreement with MPAC prohibited data sharing. We were curious if MPAC would be willing to disclose its progress since 2006, when their valuations were criticized. However, MPAC informed us that the assessment records were not entirely theirs to provide as sales data belongs to the province and is licensed to a company called Teranet. We met with representatives from MPAC and Teranet to discuss the public interest in data disclosure, but our request was denied. As a result, we took it upon ourselves to find the data. We focused on collecting data on Toronto houses that sold in 2016, which was the last year MPAC conducted a provincewide assessment update. We wanted to see how closely MPAC's assessed values aligned with market values. Gathering the sales data was relatively straightforward, but obtaining the assessment values proved to be more challenging. We utilized publicly accessible computer terminals at Toronto City Hall, but could only access one address at a time. Over the course of a year, we compiled a dataset of approximately 20,000 residential properties. We shared this data with Professor Christopher Berry from the University of Chicago and data scientist Eric Langowski, who both have extensive experience studying the assessment industry in the United States. They analyzed our data using the same methods used in their studies of assessments in numerous U.S. jurisdictions."}]}

Experts are warning of a potential early fall wave and the emergence of new fast-transmitting variants, making this year's autumn different from previous years. Fortunately, the Canadian population is being protected by high levels of immunity from vaccinations and previous infections. Additionally, a new COVID booster specifically designed to target the dominant subvariants of this year will provide further protection against the virus. While there are still uncertainties about how the fall will unfold, experts have provided valuable information about the new boosters and when to get them. It is important to remain vigilant even in this quieter phase of the pandemic, as the virus continues to evolve. The new round of vaccines is crucial in mitigating a potential fall and winter wave. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of Toronto, emphasizes the importance of having vaccines available for the highest-risk individuals before the actual COVID activity begins. National health advisory groups, including the CDC and Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI), have recommended updated boosters to target the most common subvariants in 2023, known as XBB Omicron. These boosters will be monovalent vaccines, different from previous ones that contained the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and circulating variants. Pfizer and Moderna have submitted requests to Health Canada to update their COVID boosters and are awaiting authorization. The boosters are intended for individuals aged six months and older. The companies and Health Canada have not provided specific information regarding the approval timeline, but Moderna has stated that they will be ready to supply the updated vaccine in time for the fall vaccination season. Experts, including Matthew Miller, director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research, anticipate that the boosters will likely be available around the same time as seasonal flu shots, in early to mid-October."}]}

Unfortunately, there is no positive news to report, apart from the fact that the situation could have been worse. Unlike the devastating fire in Lahaina, Hawaii, where residents were not alerted by sirens, our authorities had provided warnings to the people in Yellowknife. Efforts have been made to ensure that evacuees have access to essential resources such as gasoline, food, and water, both through the long line of vehicles leaving the city and through available flights for those who are unable to drive long distances. The implementation of firebreaks, treeless zones that can impede the progress of fires, is also underway. However, the challenge lies in providing adequate accommodations for evacuees beyond just a few days, which aligns with the modern trend of constant migration due to the lack of alternatives. Unfortunately, actively combatting these enormous fires that have consumed Canada's northern and western regions is virtually impossible given their immense scale and rapid spread. While we need all available resources to battle this catastrophe, the fires persist relentlessly. Margaret Atwood once wrote that \"survival\" is the prevailing theme of Canadian life, and we have always relied on the vast and cold expanse of our country's northern regions as a refuge. However, this assumption has been proven wrong, as the once dependable cold has been compromised and our forested landscapes are now ablaze. Recognizing the severity of the situation, the Prime Minister has convened the Incident Response Group to address this emergency. It is disheartening to realize that most evacuees will find temporary shelter in Alberta, a province led by a premier who has halted large wind and solar energy projects, highlighting the irony of the situation. Just like the sheriff in \"Jaws,\" Danielle Smith denies the existence of a looming threat, assuring people that they are safe on the beach, only for tragedy to strike. What will become of Canada's forests next August? Can we expect more blocked roads, crop damage, air pollution, avalanches, artificial snow, and homes swept away by floods? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Referring back to Danielle Smith and the federal Conservatives, it is worth mentioning the silent sirens during the Lahaina fire. Officials clarified that the sirens were intended for tsunami warnings and not fires, and their activation might have directed people straight into the flames. However, due to the delay, there were no viable escape routes remaining at that point."}]}

On that day, Karolina Huebner-Makurat, a mother of two, was tragically killed by a stray bullet outside the South Riverdale Community Health Centre. The arrest of Khalila Zara Mohammed on Monday has further shattered the already limited trust between the community and the center. It has been reported, by anonymous sources, that Mohammed, 23, and Ahmed Mustafa Ibrahim were acquainted, although the exact nature of their relationship is unclear. Mohammed was on duty when a shootout occurred outside the Leslieville facility. Not only did she allegedly assist Ibrahim in escaping the chaos immediately following the shooting, but she also aided him on subsequent occasions as he evaded police for five weeks. Additionally, she reportedly provided false information to investigators during interviews. This tragic incident highlights a convergence of social issues plaguing Toronto, including a revolving-door justice system, ineffective adherence to release conditions, brazen street crime, and the negative impacts of supervised injection sites located in residential areas, exposing neighborhoods to the consequences of illicit behavior on a daily basis. While some argue that these sites save lives by providing addicts with a controlled and safe environment monitored by trained medical professionals, incidents like the murder of Huebner-Makurat raise doubts about the safety of such facilities. The arrest of an employee who had been put on leave for unrelated reasons further undermines the credibility of the center's administrators. The concerns voiced by the community, both before and after the shooting, go beyond knee-jerk opposition to safe injection sites. Rather, residents have been seeking proper management, community engagement, accountability, and assurances of safety. They worry about their children witnessing drug use, as this does not solely occur within the center. Clients can obtain drugs for personal use or bring substances in for testing, exposing the neighborhood to the risks associated with the current opioid crisis. The presence of dirty needles, drug-related sexual activity, and drug traffickers near the facility also contribute to these concerns. Efforts have been made to address some of the community's demands, such as clearing out a laneway frequently occupied by drug users. The Toronto Police Service has also responded through its crime prevention environmental design component, offering guidance on reducing crime by considering the influence of the built environment on behavior. However, the responsibility for the immediate 15-meter perimeter around the building lies with the center. South Riverdale was one of the first three federally approved supervised consumption sites to open in late 2017, and there are now at least eight such sites in Toronto. Some of these sites are more visible and problematic than others. In May, a 40-year-old man was fatally stabbed in front of another injection site at Dundas and Victoria streets called The Works. If the Toronto Board of Health's request to decriminalize all illegal drugs for personal use in the city is granted, the resulting social complications will likely increase significantly. This has been demonstrated in British Columbia, where a drug exemption was implemented earlier this year and has proven to be disastrous, particularly in Vancouver's drug- and crime-ridden downtown eastside."}]}

As if to commemorate this occasion, a meeting at city hall on Thursday symbolized the end of the preliminary transition period for her leadership. During this meeting, Mayor Chow assigned members of the city council to various committees and boards, solidifying her governing team.\n\nIn her speech at the meeting, Mayor Chow reflected on her own experiences on city council during the tumultuous early days of amalgamation. She shared an anecdote about approaching Mel Lastman, a key opponent, to discuss potential collaboration. When asked about her passions, she mentioned her dedication to improving the lives of children. As a result, Lastman appointed her as the children\u2019s advocate, granting her the freedom to initiate projects that would enhance their welfare. This story highlights Mayor Chow's leadership philosophy, which explains why some of her appointments may appear to favor adversaries.\n\nFor instance, Jennifer McKelvie, who previously served as John Tory's right-hand woman and endorsed Ana Bail\u00e3o over Mayor Chow, retains the ceremonial title of deputy mayor and continues to lead the pivotal infrastructure committee. Similarly, Shelley Carroll, another Bail\u00e3o supporter, will assume the role of budget chief. Brad Bradford, who at times seemed to be running his own mayoral campaign against Chow, will be the vice-chair of the planning and housing committee. Mayor Chow commended Bradford for his expertise and dedication to this area. Additionally, former police officer Jon Burnside will join the police board, while Mike Colle, a veteran with unpredictable tendencies, will serve as a ceremonial deputy mayor. Frances Nunziata, whom Mayor Chow's allies at Progress Toronto opposed in the last election, will remain as council speaker, a position she genuinely enjoys despite its lack of popularity.\n\nEach of these individuals endorsed a different candidate for mayor, showcasing Mayor Chow's unique approach to leadership. Rather than keeping adversaries at arm's length, she assigns them positions that align with their passions, thereby fostering a united and cohesive direction. This contrasts sharply with Tory's strategy, which often sidelined councillors who were passionate about specific issues.\n\nNow, let's examine the roles of two notable councillors: Gord Perks and Josh Matlow. Some observers on social media noted that Matlow, a mayoral candidate against Chow, wasn't appointed as a committee chair. However, he is part of Mayor Chow's executive team and will sit on the TTC board and the planning committee, both of which align with his stated preferences. Matlow expressed gratitude for this role, and Mayor Chow considers him an integral member of her inner team. Despite potential drama behind the scenes, it is highly likely that Matlow will play a significant role in this government.\n\nPerks' appointment as the head of the housing file is intriguing because he has been a vocal critic of the private-sector supply-side approach to the housing crisis. Instead, he advocates for public housing and rent controls, which aligns closely with Mayor Chow's housing platform. However, the pairing of Perks with Bradford, who strongly supports private development, creates an interesting dynamic. Will they work together harmoniously, like Jack and Mrs. Spratt from the famous rhyme, utilizing their unique specialties to accelerate progress? Or will they clash and impede each other's progress?\n\nOnly time will tell, but the composition of Mayor Chow's team suggests an enthusiastic and collaborative approach to governance. By assigning roles based on passions and expertise, she aims to unite her council in a common mission to improve the city."}]}

Despite his wrongdoings, the premier has yet to face any repercussions for his political misdeeds. However, it might not be as simple as it seems. In 2018, even after a video emerged of Ford promising to bulldoze the protected lands, Ontarians still supported him in the election. At that time, voters believed him when he quickly renounced his secret plan and vowed to leave the greenbelt untouched. Since then, he has remained in power without facing any significant challenges. But after winning a second election in 2022, Ford reversed his stance once again. Will voters forgive his inconsistent statements and actions this time, as they did in 2018 and 2022? There are indications that times have changed, and the premier's time may be running out. While political victory is often unpredictable, defeat is more foreseeable for opposition parties that fail to adequately prepare. Unfortunately for the New Democrats, their party has struggled to gain traction under their new leader, who won the position uncontested and remains relatively unknown. On the other hand, a fiercely contested liberal leadership race is currently underway, gaining momentum and set to culminate next December. This presents a prime opportunity for the Liberals to capitalize on the greenbelt scandal and make significant gains. The opposition has seized upon this opportunity, and an auditor general's report this month has condemned the corrupt process, estimating a potential $8.28-billion windfall for favored private developers. If voters were not stirred up by this issue a year ago, they are undoubtedly outraged now. Nate Erskine-Smith, a Toronto MP and one of the Liberal leadership candidates, claims that people shrugged off Ford's behavior in the last election, believing he was not as bad as anticipated. However, the Liberals failed to offer a compelling alternative. With the Liberal revival and the Tory betrayal, voters now have a more appealing option. The upcoming debates among the five Liberal candidates will reveal whether voters perceive any difference and provide insights into their preferences. Ford's political problem regarding the greenbelt lies not only in his latest proposal but also in his past promise. He will not only be burdened by the implications of a greenbelt bonanza that benefits favored developers but also by the challenge of explaining to voters how they can trust him after explicitly pledging not to take such action. Let's revisit the secret recording and the public record. In early 2018, while vying for the Progressive Conservative leadership, Ford privately disclosed his plan to \"open a big chunk\" of the greenbelt if he became premier, citing the need to increase supply. When this information leaked, Ford assured the public that he would not pursue such a course. He claimed to listen to the people's voices: \"They don't want me to touch the greenbelt, so we won't touch the greenbelt. Simple as that.\" Ford positioned himself as a man of the people and emphasized that he governed through the people, not the government. At that time, Ford had just secured the Progressive Conservative leadership. Then-Premier Kathleen Wynne cautioned Ontarians, stating that Ford could not be trusted with a public trust because once the land was gone, it would be lost forever. She highlighted that the purpose of the greenbelt was to protect water systems and agricultural land's integrity. Wynne pointed out that there was already enough land in the region to build two more cities the size of Mississauga without compromising the greenbelt. Years later, an advisory panel established by the PC government reached the same conclusion but was disregarded."}]}

Although he hasn't been officially activated from the 10-day injured list, he joined his teammates prior to Friday night's series opener against the Reds and is expected to play on Saturday. This will be his first appearance since leaving with a right knee injury on July 31. \n\nWhen Bichette got hurt, the Jays had a 3 1/2-game lead over the Seattle Mariners for the final wild card spot. However, during his absence, the team struggled, going 8-8 and losing their firm grip on the wild-card spot. The return of Bichette, who has been the Jays' best player this season, is eagerly anticipated. His potent bat and offensive production are desperately needed, as the lineup has been starved for consistency.\n\nBichette's return is complemented by the activations of closer Jordan Romano, reliever Trevor Richards, center-fielder Kevin Kiermaier, and third baseman Matt Chapman, who were all dealing with injuries. This influx of talent is expected to have a significant impact on the team's performance.\n\nPaul DeJong, who filled in for Bichette at shortstop, struggled offensively, contributing little to the team's run production. Bichette's return is seen as a major upgrade in that position, providing consistent production and stability to a struggling spot in the lineup.\n\nThe Jays' offensive performance this month has been lackluster, ranking 17th in the majors with 63 runs. On the season, they are 16th with 4.48 runs per game, below expectations. Bichette's presence and contribution are expected to greatly improve these numbers.\n\nBichette's rehab games with Triple-A Buffalo showed promising results, with him performing well both as a designated hitter and shortstop. The team is hopeful that Kiermaier and Chapman will also make similar contributions upon their return.\n\nAs Bichette returns, the team expects him to play a full game, with occasional appearances as the designated hitter. The Jays are counting on his production at the big-league level, as well as contributions from Kiermaier and Chapman, to help turn their season around.\n\nOverall, Bichette's return brings excitement and optimism to the team. The Jays' lineup will benefit greatly from his presence and consistent offensive output. With the return of key players from injuries, the team is hopeful for improved performance and a strong push towards securing a wild-card spot."}]}

Despite a recent agreement to reduce output, crude prices in the United States fell below zero on Monday, highlighting the limitations of the OPEC cartel and its partners. Some nations are exploring additional measures to stem the decline, but their options are limited. The current leadership of OPEC+ is engaged in crisis management discussions, although there is little they can do to address the demand collapse. Algeria, as the current president of OPEC, has proposed bringing forward supply cuts, but it is unclear if this will be supported or make a significant impact. While the agreed-upon production cuts by OPEC+ are substantial, they are overshadowed by the massive loss in demand. The severity of the price collapse has prompted OPEC ministers to hold informal discussions to address the market situation. Saudi Arabia's cabinet has expressed readiness to take further measures for market stability in collaboration with other OPEC+ nations, but it remains uncertain if they have the capability to make deeper production cuts. Russia and Iraq, with a history of poor compliance with OPEC+ agreements, are also questionable in their commitment to the agreed supply curbs. The Kremlin downplayed the impact of the price collapse on Russia's economy, suggesting there is no need for alarm. Instead of intensifying their efforts, OPEC and its partners may need to adhere to the agreed plan and endure the current challenges. This will shift the burden of adjustment onto other producers like the United States, Brazil, and Canada, who have provided minimal support thus far.

A lawsuit claims that Nada owns a Maserati Quattroporte and a Lamborghini Aventador, both of which are considered highly valuable collector's cars. However, license plate records indicate that Nada drives a Lincoln Navigator SUV, while a Maserati with the license plate \"idealdev\" is registered under his company. Nada asserts that his goal was to construct modern residences within the designated time frame and budget, but he encountered difficulties meeting the financial requirements of the loans taken out for the project. He vehemently denies allegations of fraud and unjust enrichment from buyers currently suing him, some of whom he believes are attempting to manipulate the media to extract further funds from him. In an email, Nada stated that Modern Manors, originally intended as a condominium and townhouse development in Richmond Hill, faced a multitude of challenges, including delays in obtaining permits, escalating building costs, and provincial tax legislation affecting foreign buyers. These factors ultimately led to the cancellation of 72 purchase agreements, including one with Pires. Since 2015, Ideal has initiated nine multi-dwelling projects, with two being transferred or sold to other developers and three remaining undeveloped. Nada anticipates that construction for two of these projects will commence this year. Nada reveals that Ideal incurred losses of over $10 million on the Modern Manors venture, with him personally utilizing millions of dollars to reimburse deposits. He emphasizes that this exemplifies his character and the values his company upholds. While Nada refrains from commenting on his and his company's luxury cars, he mentions that he sold the mansion in 2020 to generate funds for settling his debts and now rents from the new owner. Ideal's website describes the six-bedroom, 22,000-square-foot house as the epitome of perfection. However, a lawsuit from 2020 alleged that the sale of the $11 million property to Nada's business associate was a ploy to protect assets from creditors. Ideal and Nada did not respond to the lawsuit, resulting in a judge ordering Nada to pay $150,000 to the plaintiff. In an email response to The Star, Nada explained that he did not file a defense because he was actively working with the plaintiff to reach a resolution, which they did. Nada vehemently dismisses the allegations of shielding assets from creditors as baseless speculation and fabrications intended to strengthen the lawsuit. He also refutes the plaintiff's claim that he has a history of evading debt payments by repeatedly requesting extensions, despite living luxuriously with substantial financial resources. Real estate lawyer Bob Aaron expresses the sentiment that even one canceled project is unacceptable. While acknowledging that project failures can occur for various legitimate reasons, Aaron recommends that the government prevent developers from canceling projects due to failed construction financing. Instead, developers should have a limited timeframe, such as one to two years, to cancel for financing reasons. After this period, developers should be obligated to purchase the units at fair market value. Nada shares his journey of arriving in Canada as a 19-year-old refugee from Sri Lanka and emphasizes his determination to establish companies that prioritize integrity and provide leadership opportunities for women and people of color. The sleek website for Nada's Markham-based company, Ideal Group, showcases a multimillion-dollar conglomerate engaged not only in development but also venture capital and global entertainment. According to the Home Construction Regulatory Authority (HCRA) of Ontario, Ideal has successfully completed two condominium projects: a 95-unit development in Toronto in 2017 and a 44-unit community in Scarborough in 2013. Recent undertakings include the construction and sale of nine houses in 2019 and one house in 2020, as reported by the HCRA. Markham Square stands out as one of Ideal's most ambitious projects, with an expected total of 673 units located in Unionville."}]}

This unprecedented test of democracy poses a potential threat that may escalate in the coming months. Even more concerning is the normalization of these actions, as the constant exposure to Trump's bizarre, unimaginable, and criminal behavior has desensitized the electorate. Trump currently faces a total of 78 charges, including 44 federal charges and 34 state charges. He has been criminally charged in New York, Florida, and the District of Columbia, with pending charges in Georgia. Notably, he has also been involved in civil trials, including a conviction for sexual abuse that was classified as \"rape\" by the presiding judge.\n\nThe most serious allegations against Trump relate to his attempts to deny and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. These charges include conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding (the congressional confirmation of Joe Biden's victory), and obstruction of that confirmation. Specifically, he is accused of inciting a crowd to storm Congress on January 6, 2021, which was a dark day in U.S. history. These charges related to his actions after losing the election hold significant importance, as they involve the fundamental function of peaceful election result collection, counting, and certification. Constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe from Harvard University has stated that the crimes Trump is indicted for exceed anything committed against the country by any American citizen, especially a former president.\n\nDespite these serious charges, there is a possibility that Trump may seek the presidency again. He currently holds a commanding lead of 37 points over his closest competitor in the race for the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election. Additionally, he appears to be in a tight race with incumbent Democrat Joe Biden. Alarmingly, nearly seven in ten Republicans still believe that Biden's victory was illegitimate, and those who hold onto this falsehood view the prosecution of Trump as a Democratic plot to destroy his 2024 presidential ambitions. If he wins, Trump could potentially pardon himself if convicted (though it's unclear if that's possible) or instruct his Justice Department to dismiss any pending charges. If another Republican wins the presidency, it's likely that Trump could persuade them to pardon him, given the loyalty many competitors show to his argument that the Biden administration has weaponized the Justice Department to prevent his return to power.\n\nIt's crucial for Canadians to not view these events as mere spectators. American trends, including the negative ones, have a history of crossing the border. We've already experienced an extended occupation of our capital, and there have been numerous instances where our political leaders have been subjected to vile names and false accusations during public appearances. Furthermore, our democracy faces threats from foreign interference. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has maintained an attacking stance since assuming leadership, but the responsibility to shift our political dialogue from venomous to healthy debate rests with all our leaders. Our neighbors are navigating a perilous path, but we have the opportunity to avoid the same pitfalls. However, it will require enlightened political leadership to ensure we don't fall into the same trap."}]}

These resolutions are well-intentioned goals aimed at improving ourselves and making a positive impact on the world. We write them down and discuss how we can support each other in achieving them. This year, the IPC (Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario) has also made a New Year's resolution. Our aim is to enhance our outreach to children and youth, specifically focusing on privacy and access. We want to empower the next generation of digital citizens in Ontario. To fulfill this resolution, we are excited to announce the establishment of a Youth Advisory Council. This group of highly-engaged young individuals will provide guidance to our office in developing educational materials that are relevant to their age group. They will also hold us accountable for our commitments. We have carefully selected ten impressive members for the council, ranging in age from 15 to 24. They come from diverse backgrounds and have varied academic pursuits, including science, technology, business, law, and social justice. Beyond their academic pursuits, these individuals are actively involved in their communities and participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music. For example, we have a council member who plays the violin in the Hamilton Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and another who founded a Model United Nations club. Some are engaged with their local Indigenous Friendship Centre, while others are involved in their high school's Black Student Union Association or serve as mentors for 2SLGBTQ+ students. What stood out to me when reviewing their applications was their shared desire to collaborate with others to create positive change in the world, particularly in shaping tomorrow's digital citizens. Children and youth in the digital world are one of our strategic priorities at the IPC. We are committed to advocating for digital literacy and rights for young people. We also hold public institutions accountable for safeguarding the privacy and well-being of the children and youth they serve. In recent years, we have undertaken several initiatives to engage with youth advocacy groups and create resources such as the \"Privacy Pursuit! Games and Activities for Kids.\" We have also launched a youth-focused Instagram page and dedicated podcast episodes and events to privacy and access issues among children and youth. However, what was missing from these initiatives was the direct input from young people themselves. Today's youth have grown up in the online world, and consequently, they possess a unique understanding of its challenges and opportunities. Their perspectives are invaluable in supporting our efforts to promote digital literacy and expand digital privacy and access rights for youth in a way that resonates with them. With the involvement of our Youth Advisory Council, I am confident that we can make a tangible difference in the lives of Ontario's children and youth. By equipping them with the necessary tools and resources, we can empower them to protect their privacy, safety, and dignity as they navigate the online world on their journey towards adulthood. Our goal is to guide this next generation through the complexities of the digital landscape and ensure that they have the knowledge and skills to thrive in it. By including young people in our conversations and learning from their insights, we can fulfill our New Year's resolution to create a better digital world for our children and future generations."}]}

One such decision is PHIPA Decision 175, which outlines an investigation into the sale of de-identified data by a health information custodian to a third-party corporation. Our office was initially alerted to this situation through an article in the Toronto Star, prompting us to launch an investigation under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA). \n\nThere are three main lessons to be learned from this investigation. Firstly, the process of de-identification, which involves removing personal information from a record or dataset, is considered a use under PHIPA. According to PHIPA, \"use\" entails viewing, handling, or otherwise dealing with personal health information. Moreover, the use of personal health information for de-identification purposes is allowed without the individual's consent, subject to certain conditions. Health information custodians, who have custody and control of personal health information, must also be transparent with the public about their information practices by providing a written public notice.\n\nThis brings us to the second key finding of the decision. If custodians intend to de-identify and sell the de-identified data to a third party for various purposes, including health-related research, they must clearly state this in their public notice. Patients must be aware of how their health data is being used and for what reasons in order to hold custodians accountable under PHIPA.\n\nThe third key takeaway concerns a custodian's security obligations. PHIPA mandates that custodians take reasonable measures to protect and secure the personal health information they possess, including during the de-identification process. Additionally, any sale agreement between a health information custodian and a third party must include privacy and security controls to ensure the de-identified data remains truly de-identified. The highest standards of de-identification must be upheld to prevent re-identification and safeguard individuals' privacy. A comprehensive de-identification governance process should include regular re-identification risk assessments.\n\nI urge custodians and public institutions to refer to our de-identification guidelines for structured data. These guidelines, which have received recognition, introduce fundamental concepts and techniques of de-identification, as well as key considerations when de-identifying personal information.\n\nInterestingly, there are parallels between the main findings of PHIPA Decision 175 and some recommendations made by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics (ETHI) in its recent report on the federal government's collection and use of de-identified mobility data during the pandemic. Among its recommendations, the ETHI committee emphasizes the need for transparency in informing Canadians about ongoing mobility data collection programs by clearly outlining their nature and purpose. Similarly, in PHIPA Decision 175, we emphasized the importance of custodians being transparent by clearly stating the purposes of de-identifying personal health information and its intended use in their public statement.\n\nThe ETHI report also suggests prohibiting the re-identification of de-identified data and imposing penalties for doing so. PHIPA has already addressed this by not permitting the re-identification of de-identified information since 2019 (with certain exceptions), and making it a clear offense for anyone who intentionally re-identifies data in violation of PHIPA.\n\nLastly, the ETHI report presents several recommendations for reforming federal privacy laws to address the risks associated with the collection, use, and disclosure of de-identified data. In Ontario, the government amended PHIPA in 2020 to allow for the eventual development of regulations that would more explicitly define the expectations and standards for de-identifying data."}]}

Instead of the traditional method of physically visiting stores and browsing before making purchases, many people now rely on ecommerce platforms such as Amazon and even order groceries online. According to Statistics Canada, in 2021, 82% of Canadians engaged in online shopping, compared to 73% in 2018. However, for the one million Canadians who are unbanked, meaning they do not possess a bank account, and an additional one to two million who are underbanked, lacking access to convenient and everyday banking services, shopping online can be challenging or even impossible.\n\nAs consumers increasingly transition to online platforms, they are commonly presented with credit card payment options. Fortunately, Payment Source has introduced innovative payment solutions that prioritize financial inclusion, ensuring that Canadians can make payments using their preferred methods. Payment Source firmly believes in a better way to pay for everyday necessities. \"There's a social good element that motivates and drives us,\" affirms CEO Rob Hyde. This Toronto-based company is part of a thriving community of over 750 fintech companies in Ontario, constituting the largest cluster in North America after New York. These companies are revolutionizing the way we handle financial transactions.\n\nHyde acknowledges that Toronto's vibrant tech market, within Ontario's innovation corridor, has been instrumental in Payment Source's success. The city boasts North America's fastest-growing tech sector and was recently recognized for the largest \"brain gain\" in the 2022 CBRE Tech Talent Report. Hyde explains, \"Ontario possesses both tech talent and financial expertise, thanks to the presence of major banks in Toronto. This combination creates an incubator for ideas.\" Toronto's dynamic environment, characterized by collaboration and healthy competition, has propelled Payment Source to develop its groundbreaking fintech solutions.\n\nPayment Source serves as a lifeline for underbanked Canadians, enabling the eight percent of the population lacking credit cards for reasons such as privacy, debt, or personal preferences to make online purchases. Hyde clarifies, \"We do offer credit options in some of our solutions, but our goal is to eliminate the necessity for individuals to choose a specific payment method determined solely by an organization or group.\" However, Payment Source's cards are not only beneficial for those without credit cards or bank accounts but also for individuals seeking to manage their spending and avoid accumulating debt. Hyde highlights, \"I can provide a card like this to my children without concern that I am granting them unlimited access to my credit limit.\"\n\nAs a prominent participant in Toronto's thriving tech scene, Payment Source is among the 148 Ontario delegates at this year's Collision Conference. The cooperative and competitive environment in Toronto has played a crucial role in driving Payment Source to develop its innovative fintech solutions. Hyde emphasizes, \"The atmosphere of cooperation here greatly facilitates the advancement of new ideas and the creation of new value.\" For him, being based in Ontario has been instrumental in the company's growth due to the presence of numerous outstanding fintech companies and collaborative associations that understand innovation is not solely driven by competitiveness but also by cooperation."}]}

This was because I had also been working at the embassy during the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster. Just like back then, I could sense that our lives were about to be greatly disrupted, albeit temporarily.\n\nDuring the crisis in 2011, our focus shifted towards responding to the immediate needs and assisting Canadians in Japan. Similarly, we have now adjusted our plans and strategies to adapt to the current realities on the ground. As the head of Ontario's trade and investment office in the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, my team and I are dedicated to promoting trade, investment, and science and technology linkages between Ontario and Japan.\n\nWhile Japan has always viewed Ontario as an attractive destination for investment and a reliable source of imports, achieving success in this market is not without its challenges. Cultural and language differences, as well as the importance of face-to-face interactions for relationship building, have often posed obstacles. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 restrictions have limited business travel and personal contact, which could have potentially negatively impacted our work.\n\nHowever, amidst these difficulties, the pandemic has also accelerated certain positive trends and changes that were already underway before the global crisis. From my perspective, the most significant change with the greatest potential for Ontario is Japan's approach to innovation. Japan has long been recognized as an innovation hub, with its inventions transforming lives worldwide. In the past, Japanese mega-companies primarily relied on closed models of innovation, utilizing in-house teams to create new ideas and technologies for their brands. Additionally, they predominantly depended on fixed supply chains, making it challenging for foreign companies to establish a foothold.\n\nFortunately, disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence and interconnectedness have forced even the most insular companies to embrace a more open approach to stay competitive. Japanese firms now recognize the importance of collaborating with innovative foreign companies, regardless of size, and investing overseas to benefit from innovation-driven ecosystems. Although California and Israel have traditionally been the focus, there is now a growing awareness of Ontario's offerings. The province boasts a dynamic innovation ecosystem with lower costs and unique advantages, including access to diverse talent and an exceptional quality of life.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by COVID-19, or perhaps because of it, we have witnessed an increased demand from the Japanese business community to connect with Ontario's start-up and innovation ecosystems."}]}

Well, that future is already here. Chillwall's deep learning AI provides a visitor discovery experience that feels human, tailoring suggestions based on a user's location, interests, and mood. Located in Toronto, Chillwall AI is a data intelligence firm founded by Michael Campanelli, MBA, and Dr. Ian Knowles. Their remarkable machine learning algorithms power their proprietary AI, named Betty, which learns from data patterns to identify personalized opportunities. Betty knows what each person wants before they even realize it themselves.\n\nChillwall AI's new disruptive virtual concierge, Discovery My Way, focuses on personal discovery based on the user's emotions. Michael Campanelli explains, \"Our growth will revolve around creating a transformative visitor experience for hotels and tourism, followed by increasing revenue in the retail sector.\" This service comes in the form of a concierge widget that can be easily integrated into any digital platform with just a few lines of code. Our focus is on igniting curiosity and converting it into a desire to explore and enjoy unique local experiences such as festivals, cooking classes, or new restaurants.\n\nWe understand that most experience-based purchases are driven by emotions, and that's why our concierge is designed to discover and interact with users. Betty's deep learning capabilities develop an understanding of visitors' interests and passions, just like a human concierge would, in order to recommend experiences tailored to their emotions. Michael Campanelli refers to this as \"discovery without search,\" which is the future of experience-based discovery platforms.\n\nChillwall's AI innovation seamlessly aligns with the growing experience-oriented economy. According to a study by Expedia and the Center for Generational Kinetics, an astonishing 74% of Americans prioritize experiences over material possessions. Spending money on travel, concerts, and tourist activities brings more lasting joy and fulfillment. Experiences are also more easily shared on social media, which is important to younger generations. Sharing pictures and stories from a hike or cooking class is more engaging than showing off a newly purchased TV.\n\nChillwall's founders recognize this shift in consumer preferences and have tailored their business model to thrive in this trillion-dollar experience-focused market. Thanks to their proprietary AI, Chillwall can process millions of calculations quickly through light data models, meeting the needs of this new consumer economy. They acknowledge the support they've received from various accelerators and the Ontario government. As a graduate of the University of Waterloo Linked AC Accelerator, one of the world's top five accelerators, Chillwall greatly appreciates the tremendous support from the Ontario government, which allows businesses to launch and receive expert support.\n\nPredictive AI personalized to an individual level will revolutionize how we interact with our living spaces and usher in a new era of augmented reality.

Canada as a whole is committed to developing sustainable transportation methods for the benefit of the planet, and the Toronto region is leading the charge by investing in a robust EV ecosystem.\n\nIt is worth noting that Canada's energy is 82.5% emission-free, which is double the rate of the United States and 20 points better than the European Union. However, transportation still accounts for 25% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, Ontario has made significant progress in reducing CO2 emissions generated from electricity, decreasing from 17% to 2% over a 15-year period. The province is determined to maintain this momentum.\n\nThe Government of Canada has unveiled a $120 billion clean economy plan as part of the federal 2023 budget, with the Toronto region at its core. EV companies in the Toronto region benefit from an end-to-end EV supply chain that facilitates access to talent, materials, and facilities required for the production of electric vehicles. Although the region may not have abundant mineral resources, it compensates with high-tech research and development facilities, a skilled workforce, and a robust supply chain that connects companies to manufacturing facilities nationwide.\n\nFurthermore, the recent announcement from the Government of Ontario strengthening the trade relationship with Michigan has further enhanced the Toronto region's ties with major EV manufacturing hubs in Canada and globally. The region's capacity to independently produce an electric bus from start to finish is a testament to its quality manufacturers. The presence of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the Toronto region promotes a thriving EV sector due to the high concentration of EV companies and government incentives. Magna International, for instance, recently expanded its Brampton facility to support the production of battery enclosures for electric vehicles.\n\nTesla's automation manufacturing facility in Markham has positioned the Toronto region as a significant player in the future of electric mobility. The expansion of their facility has enabled the scaled-up production of machinery for battery cell production. Stellantis, a world-leading automotive manufacturing corporation, has also made substantial investments in its Brampton and Windsor plants to increase EV production. The company's Brampton plant has achieved global recognition with the world-class manufacturing award. Additionally, Stellantis' Windsor branch facilitates a quick and efficient supply chain solution to one of northern Ontario's mineral hubs.\n\nNova Bus and New Flyer, Canadian corporations, are playing a vital role in the electrification of public transportation in the Toronto region. The City of Toronto aims to transition to all zero-emission vehicles in its transit fleet by 2025 and achieve a 100% zero-emission fleet by 2040. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) operates one of the largest electric bus fleets in North America, and the electrification of this fleet will significantly reduce the country's overall emissions. The Government of Canada supports this mission by providing $140 million in funding for electric bus procurement and infrastructure development for EV charging.\n\nNova Bus, located in Montreal, Quebec, and New Flyer in Winnipeg, Manitoba, exemplify the strong interprovincial supply chain that operates within the Toronto region."}]}

The city has become a hub for highly skilled and top-quality tech professionals. In particular, the occupation of software developers and programmers has seen remarkable growth, with a 58.3 percent increase between 2017 and 2022. This surge in talent demonstrates Toronto's appeal as a tech hub, attracting professionals from around the world.\n\nIt is worth noting that Toronto's tech talent pool experienced a slight decrease in 2022, with 285,700 tech workers compared to 289,700 in 2021. This decline can be attributed in part to the economic uncertainty and tech layoffs faced in 2022, as well as the flexibility of remote work options for tech professionals. Despite this dip in employment, Toronto maintains its position as the third-largest tech talent workforce in North America. With Canada's welcoming immigration programs, Toronto's tech workforce will continue to thrive.\n\nOne notable characteristic of Toronto's tech talent is its diverse and young population. Between 2016 and 2021, Toronto saw significant population growth in the 20s and 30s age groups. Individuals in their 20s grew by 11.1 percent, while those in their 30s grew by 14.7 percent. This growth is among the highest across large tech markets, highlighting the city's expanding tech workforce and innovative potential. In terms of diversity, Toronto's tech talent workforce is composed of 68 percent visible minorities, with Asians comprising the majority. Additionally, women in tech make up 27 percent of the workforce, a percentage that continues to grow steadily.\n\nToronto experienced the second-largest tech talent growth in North America between 2017 and 2022, second only to the San Francisco Bay Area. During this period, the city added 63,800 tech jobs, representing a 29 percent growth over the past five years. In fact, Toronto was recognized as the fastest-growing tech talent market in the previous year, underscoring the city's promise in the industry. To sustain this growth, Toronto is actively expanding its tech talent pipeline. The city ranks in the top 10 among its U.S. counterparts for tech degree completions, which grew by 41.7 percent from 2017 to 2021, surpassing the national average.\n\nToronto's tech talent is primarily concentrated in the tech industry itself, followed closely by the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) industry. Approximately 43 percent of the tech talent in Toronto works within the tech industry, while 20 percent is employed in the FIRE industry. This concentrated workforce has fostered a robust innovation ecosystem, supporting Toronto's rise as a global hub for artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the significant presence of tech workers in the FIRE industry complements Toronto's reputation as a leader in financial services innovation and a prime destination for fintech investments. Toronto stands as the second-largest financial center in North America and the largest in Canada, with all five of Canada's major banks headquartered in the city, alongside notable fintech companies such as Wealthsimple and Borrowell.\n\nToronto has firmly established itself as a thriving tech job market. The city's strong growth in tech talent, combined with the presence of leading tech companies and abundant job opportunities, has created an ideal environment for tech professionals. Toronto was ranked as the top job market, with 31,405 more tech jobs created than there were graduates. In addition to supporting the growth of the tech talent pipeline, companies based in Toronto hire a significant number of tech professionals. Recognizing the potential in Toronto, tech leaders like Snowflake and Oxbotica have invested in the city's tech ecosystem by establishing their presence here. To further enhance Toronto's tech ecosystem, the government of Canada has launched a 'Tech Talent Strategy', introducing additional immigration programs to support the country's status as a global leader in tech talent recruitment and attraction. One such program is a streamlined work permit for H1-B visa holders in the U.S., which proved highly successful, reaching its target of 10,000 applicants within just two days. This success serves as a testament to Toronto's allure for jobseekers."}]}

In 2019, we embarked on a mission to substantiate the claims made by both Torontonians and those residing in the 905 area code about our diverse population. Now, after four years and some monumental global events, we revisit the data to once again confirm that the Toronto region remains the epitome of multiculturalism. This commitment to diversity is ingrained in the official motto of the City of Toronto: \"Diversity, our strength.\"\n\nEsteemed figures, including renowned chef Anthony Bourdain and Amazon, have acknowledged the Toronto region's unique advantage in hosting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. In 2016, BBC Radio even proclaimed Toronto as the most multicultural city in the world, following an offer from London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, to contest the title. While cities like New York, London, Sydney, and Los Angeles, along with vibrant metropolises such as Singapore, Jerusalem, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Mumbai, boast multiple distinct cultural and ethnic communities, the Toronto region's diversity remains unparalleled.\n\nA compelling aspect that sets the Toronto region apart is the proportion of its foreign-born population, which surpasses that of nearly every other major city worldwide. Half of the region's population is comprised of individuals who were not born in Canada, a statistic higher than any other North American metropolitan region, as well as exceeding London, Sydney, Melbourne, Paris, and Amsterdam. In terms of ethnic diversity, Toronto consistently outranks other Canadian cities, with Vancouver being the closest contender. In 2022, more than 128,000 new permanent residents chose Toronto as their home, accounting for 30 percent of Canada's total newcomers. In contrast, Montreal, the second-largest recipient of newcomers, welcomed just under 53,000 individuals, less than half Toronto's numbers.\n\nThe Toronto region prides itself on the representation of over 250 ethnicities and 190 languages, in addition to the official languages of Canada, English and French. Mandarin, Punjabi, Tagalog, Urdu, Tamil, and many more languages can be heard within our diverse communities. Approximately half of the population identifies as a visible minority. These statistics, however, only scratch the surface of our multicultural tapestry.\n\nA visit to the Toronto region will reveal that multiculturalism is interwoven into every facet of our way of life. Whether through our cuisine, art, festivals, or businesses, the influence of our diverse population is unmistakable. Numerous neighborhoods represent different ethnic communities, such as Chinatown, Little Italy, Greektown, and Little India in Toronto, along with communities like Markham and Brampton in the 905 area. These vibrant enclaves proudly preserve and celebrate their cultural identities, offering a tantalizing experience of their respective cuisines, traditions, and languages. Exploring these neighborhoods offers a glimpse into the rich multicultural fabric of our city.\n\nVarious events showcase our city's multicultural heritage, providing residents and visitors with an opportunity to immerse themselves in a global array of cultures. These festivals offer a wide range of international cuisines, from Thai to Ethiopian, Korean to Lebanese, catering to diverse tastes and preferences. Multiculturalism is also a driving force in the Toronto region's business ecosystem. Embracing a diverse workforce, multilingual customer service, international trade, and cultural entrepreneurship, businesses within the region recognize the value of diverse perspectives, experiences, and cultural backgrounds. Companies that expand their operations here view our multiculturalism as an asset.\n\nThe Toronto region's commitment to inclusivity is evident through its inclusive policies, which foster a sense of belonging and ensure equal opportunities for all residents. Legislation and initiatives combat discrimination and promote diversity in areas such as employment equity, 2SLGBTQ+ rights, accessibility, and immigrant integration. The region's dedication to inclusivity is further demonstrated through programs that support marginalized communities, provide language services, and establish safe spaces for diverse populations. These policies contribute to social cohesion, empower individuals, and make the Toronto region a welcoming and inclusive city."}]}

an appealing destination for young people to relocate to, but questions why they choose to stay. We have the answers. Here are five compelling reasons why young individuals are drawn to the Toronto region.\n\nFirstly, education plays a significant role in attracting young talent. With 18 esteemed colleges and universities in and around Toronto, students have access to a diverse range of fields to pursue their passion. From the renowned Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto to Sheridan College, dubbed the \"Harvard of animation,\" there are opportunities for everyone. Moreover, the Toronto region hosts over 370,000 international students who benefit from Canada's favorable student immigration policies, making it easier for them to remain in the country. In fact, in 2022, more than 46,000 international students in the Toronto region held post-graduate work permits, enabling them to work for any employer in Canada for up to three years. Subsequently, many choose to apply for permanent residency to further advance their careers.\n\nSecondly, the Toronto region's exceptional diversity resonates strongly with young individuals seeking a place to call home. According to the Urban Work Index, diversity is ranked as the fourth most crucial aspect for young people when choosing a residence, surpassing even education. Few places in the world can rival the Toronto region in terms of diversity. Brampton, Mississauga, and Toronto hold the top three spots for equity, diversity, and inclusion. Approximately half of the Toronto region's population is foreign-born, representing over 250 ethnicities and 190 languages. This multicultural atmosphere allows residents to find a sense of familiarity and belonging. For instance, Mississauga houses the largest number of Japanese companies in Canada, Brampton boasts a population with 38 percent of South Asian descent, and Cantonese is the predominant language in Markham. Young individuals from all corners of the globe feel comfortable and welcomed in the Toronto region due to these vibrant communities.\n\nThirdly, the Toronto region excels in transportation infrastructure, ensuring convenience and connectivity. The cities previously mentioned, along with others, are easily accessible through the regional transit system, Go Transit, which spans over 1,200 kilometers and operates over 6,000 services weekly. This network enables young people to live anywhere in the region while working elsewhere effortlessly. Furthermore, Go Trains extend beyond the Toronto region, reaching cities like Hamilton and Waterloo. In terms of climate action, Go Transit's operator, Metrolinx, has set an ambitious goal of having electric trains running every 15 minutes in heavily traveled sections of the network. With the extensive Go Transit and Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), young individuals may never have to rely on personal vehicles again, aligning with their desire for sustainable transportation options.\n\nNext, the Toronto region's robust economy provides young people with stability and numerous opportunities. As the second-largest financial center in North America and the largest in Canada, the region's diverse industrial makeup contributes approximately 20 percent to the country's total GDP. Despite the economic uncertainties faced by young individuals, the Toronto region's economy has proven resilient. By the end of 2021, we had surpassed pre-pandemic employment levels, and job numbers continue to grow steadily. With 38 percent of Canada's multinational headquarters and nearly half of Fortune 500 companies situated in the Toronto region, the workforce is rich with possibilities. Young individuals can confidently join an economy they can rely on.\n\nFinally, the Toronto region fosters an entrepreneurial spirit, making it an attractive hub for innovation and creativity. Numerous success stories exemplify the region's ability to nurture talent. One such example is Domee Shi, a Sheridan animation graduate who became the first woman to solely direct a Pixar film. Her 2018 short film, \"Bao,\" even won an Academy Award. Countless other students from the Toronto region leverage their experiences here to innovate, inspire, and achieve unprecedented feats. The region recognizes that quality of life plays a crucial role in fueling entrepreneurship and innovation. With five major professional sports teams, a multitude of theaters, and iconic event venues like the Royal Alexandra Theatre, the oldest operating theater in North America, young individuals in the Toronto region can revel in their leisure time after work.\n\nIn conclusion, the Toronto region presents an exceptional environment for young people seeking opportunities, education, diversity, convenience, economic stability, and a platform for entrepreneurial endeavors. The region's allure is undeniable, and it continues to attract and retain talent from around the world."}]}

Yesterday, Interactive Ontario, in collaboration with the City of Toronto and other partners, released a report that focuses on the intersection of tech and creativity, specifically in the creative technology sector. The report, titled \"Ontario's Next Gen Industry,\" explores the impact of the booming tech industry on creative industries such as film, animation, and gaming. It provides businesses with insights on how to tap into the fast-growing creative tech industry in Ontario.\n\nThe creative technology industry encompasses various sub-sectors, including animation, film, virtual and augmented reality, VFX, and other forms of virtual production. The Toronto region is one of the top three largest screen-based industries in North America, employing over 30,000 people in the film sector alone. Notable contributions come from Pinewood Studios in Toronto, known for iconic creations such as \"The Little Mermaid\" (2023), \"Stephen King's IT\" (2017-2019), and \"Star Trek Discovery\" (2017-2019). Studios in Markham have also produced notable works such as \"The Boys\" (2022) and \"Women Talking\" (2022). Markham is currently constructing the largest studio in Canada, funded in part by Ryan Reynolds, featuring 20 sound stages. Additionally, the City of Mississauga plans to build a 450,000 square foot studio, creating around 5,000 long-term jobs in the film industry. These studios leverage tech innovations from the extensive pool of over 289,000 skilled professionals employed in the Toronto region's tech industry, driving the growth of the creative tech industry.\n\nThe animation/VFX industry in the Toronto region alone has experienced a 42% growth in the past five years. In the 2020-2021 academic year, postsecondary institutions enrolled over 1,200 students in game and interactive media programs, and 1,400 students in animation-related programs. With daily tech advancements and generous tax incentives, the thriving media industry in the Toronto region naturally seizes these opportunities to innovate and captivate global audiences.\n\nThe \"Ontario's Next Gen Industry\" report identified four key findings. Firstly, there is a significant demand for senior and mid-level creative tech talent, and immigration is the solution to address this shortage. Secondly, focusing on equity, diversity, and inclusion is crucial for talent attraction, with an emphasis on inclusivity. Thirdly, local postsecondary institutions provide high-quality programs but must adapt further to meet evolving market needs. Implementing micro-credentials, as already done at Ontario Tech University, can be an effective approach. Lastly, Ontario's creative tech sector consists of a healthy mix of small studios and large multinationals. Attracting large-scale companies not only supports the growth of startups but also creates opportunities for senior-level talent attraction.\n\nOverall, the Toronto region's creative technology sector is flourishing, driven by the convergence of tech and creativity. By leveraging the region's tech advancements, diverse talent pool, and government support, businesses can thrive in this rapidly growing industry."}]}

As the world's top OEM, Volkswagen's decision to establish a cutting-edge manufacturing facility in Ontario's automotive corridor is a significant step towards driving a structural industry transformation. This news is especially significant as it marks the first time in over 35 years that a company of this scale has entered the Canadian market.\n\nThe decline of Ontario's manufacturing sector has been well-documented, with offshoring becoming a prevalent trend starting in the late 1990s. The financial crisis of 2007/08 further accelerated this decline. As someone with family members working in manufacturing, particularly the auto sector, I understand the profound impact this downward slide has had on families and communities.\n\nThe concept of a \"manufacturing renaissance\" in Canada has been discussed for years, but it has been challenging to envision how it would materialize. However, the idea gained momentum during the pandemic as reshoring emerged as a potential solution to the disruptions experienced in global supply chains. While global supply chains tend to be focused on cost, I have always supported the idea of a domestic manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, I remained skeptical about the possibility of large-scale reindustrialization.\n\nThe Volkswagen announcement has prompted me to believe that this could indeed be the beginning of something significant. Two key ideas have been at the forefront of my thinking since learning the news. The first is the concept of the industrial commons, which encompasses various resources that manufacturers can utilize to enhance competitiveness and drive innovation. These resources include the skills and knowledge of the labor force, supplier networks, customers, trade schools, colleges, universities, and even competitors. The addition of Volkswagen's second gigafactory to Ontario's existing automotive ecosystem is an unparalleled boost to the industrial commons. While its impact will primarily be felt in the automotive sector, the skills and knowledge gained will also benefit other manufacturing sectors to some extent.\n\nThe automotive industry is currently undergoing its most significant transformation since factory electrification. Interestingly, Ontario has a unique advantage compared to the U.S. auto sector. All of Ontario's OEMs are concentrated within a 550-kilometer corridor of major highways, while U.S. assembly plants are scattered across the eastern half of the country. Proximity plays a crucial role for two reasons. Firstly, shorter distances between shipping and final delivery points typically result in lower transportation costs. Secondly, having suppliers in close proximity to customers enables more effective and frequent in-person collaboration, which is essential for being first-to-market and ensuring precision in final assembly.\n\nThe concept of a manufacturing renaissance has been discussed for decades, but it has lacked the necessary traction to become a reality. However, with the developments observed over the past year, coupled with Volkswagen's gigafactory announcement, I am filled with optimism that our regional manufacturing sector is on the verge of significant growth. I eagerly await the outcome to see if my optimism is justified."}]}

As one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Ontario and a key economic driver in York Region, Markham has a long history of attracting contract manufacturers. We recently sat down with Charles Tonna, Executive Vice President at Microart, to discuss the development of the local hardware technology ecosystem and why its future lies in the Toronto region.\n\nAt Microart, we offer a range of services including printed circuit board (PCB) layout, PCB assembly, PCBA test development, and box build/general manufacturing services for prototypes and low-to-mid volume production. With over 40 years of experience, we have provided comprehensive circuit board assembly services to customers in Canada and the U.S. Our Markham facility houses more than 300 employees who work on a wide variety of products using state-of-the-art design, production, and testing equipment. We pride ourselves on delivering high-quality hardware solutions to customers across North America, as every piece of technology, from mobile phones to household gadgets, relies on a PCB assembly.\n\nThe history of contract manufacturing in Markham can be traced back to IBM, which established its Canadian headquarters in the city in 1983. IBM's presence attracted a skilled workforce, leading to a surge in hardware engineering expertise and advanced manufacturing experience in the region. Other major companies like Celestica followed suit, further bolstering the local industry. Despite downsizing in recent years, these companies left behind a wealth of technological knowledge, creating opportunities for new players in the hardware tech space. Today, companies like SMTC, Creation, Artaflex, Radient, and Bittele have made Markham their home, establishing the city as a global manufacturing hub.\n\nMicroart's decision to choose Markham was motivated by our CEO, Mark Wood's, commitment to giving back to his hometown. By creating jobs and harnessing the existing pool of highly educated and experienced workers, we contribute to the local economy and support the growth of electronics manufacturing. The diverse and skilled workforce in Markham sets it apart from other locations. Many of our employees are immigrants or mature workers with decades of experience, making them an integral part of our team. At Microart, we prioritize fostering a positive and supportive culture to retain talent and recognize our shared history in York Region.\n\nWe leverage the abundant talent pool in the Toronto region by investing in our employees' growth. In the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry, a college degree is not a prerequisite for entry-level positions. We offer opportunities for career advancement, allowing individuals to start on the production line and progress to program manager roles within five years. To develop our domestic talent, Microart collaborates with postsecondary institutions in the Toronto region. I personally serve on the board at Durham College, and we have an apprenticeship program in partnership with Canadore College in North Bay, Ontario. Our apprenticeship routes encompass hardware technicians, network technicians, microelectronics manufacturers, and surface mount technicians.\n\nMicroart contributes to the future of hardware tech in Canada by collaborating with organizations like VentureLab. Through partnerships like VentureLab's Accelerate AI program, funded by Scale AI, we support and scale AI startups in the supply chain industry. The manufacturing industry in Markham has a long-standing tradition of reciprocal connections, and we are proud to continue that legacy by forging partnerships and finding the best talent in York Region."}]}

Back on January 1, 2008, significant changes were made to the municipal act, allowing the public to file complaints about closed meetings of municipal councils, boards, or committees. This marked the introduction of the Ontario Ombudsman, who would investigate such complaints free of charge if a municipality did not appoint its own investigator. If a meeting was found to be illegal, a public report and recommendations would be issued.\n\nOver the past decade, municipal accountability has continued to grow. In 2016, the ombudsman's mandate was expanded to include oversight of all aspects of municipal government and services. Further amendments to the act in 2018 refined the open meeting rules, including new exceptions and a clear definition of \"meeting.\" Additionally, starting in 2019, every municipality will be required to have a code of conduct and provide public access to an integrity commissioner.\n\nWhile the introduction of the closed meeting investigator regime faced initial challenges, including unfamiliarity with the ombudsman's office at the local level, it has ultimately added value by improving transparency and governance. Contrary to fears, the number of complaints received has remained steady, with the majority coming from council members seeking guidance on following the open meeting rules. This has provided a valuable educational opportunity to enhance meeting procedures and accountability mechanisms.\n\nMunicipalities have also made progress in recording their closed meetings, which is now considered a best practice. Previously, there was a misconception that even taking minutes in closed meetings was against the law. However, it is now widely recognized that recordings contribute to accurate records and efficient investigations.\n\nDespite concerns about increased complaints overwhelming limited resources, municipalities are embracing the opportunity for education and improvement. The overall goal is to foster transparency and public accountability in local governance."}]}

The daily interactions between the ombudsman's office and public sector bodies in resolving individual complaints have a significant impact on the ombudsman's effectiveness in addressing systemic issues and recommending policy and procedural changes. By solely examining individual complaints in isolation, ombudsman offices miss the opportunity to address the root causes of complaints and suggest corrective actions to prevent their recurrence. This highlights the importance of systemic investigations and the potential for the ombudsman to have a significant positive impact on society.\n\nThe ombudsman is uniquely positioned to propose solutions to problems that affect wide segments of society. The key to adding maximum value lies in getting the ombudsman's recommendations accepted and implemented. The office of the ombudsman of Ontario has successfully utilized various techniques to achieve this, which will be discussed further in this paper. However, it is important to emphasize that the process of getting recommendations accepted begins even before they are presented. Building relationships based on trust is the first step, which involves establishing credibility and trust with all stakeholders, including the public sector bodies overseen by the ombudsman. Trust and credibility are earned primarily by employing a fair and credible process. If an ombudsman aims to promote procedural fairness, it is crucial to be fair in the investigative process. This includes providing advance notice of systemic investigations, ideally through a meeting between the ombudsman and the head of the organization. During this meeting, the reasons for the investigation should be explained, a commitment to a fair and impartial process should be made, a collaborative approach should be emphasized, and input and commentary from the organization should be invited at any time.\n\nWhenever possible, it is beneficial to demonstrate to the organization that the ombudsman's systemic investigation will provide value. It serves not only the public interest but can also be in the best interest of the organization itself. The organization's work can be validated by an independent third party, boosting internal morale, or constructive feedback can be provided to address the root causes of complaints and prevent their recurrence. Progressive organizations should embrace complaints as opportunities to enhance relationships with stakeholders and improve operations. As Bill Gates once said, \"A dissatisfied customer is your best source of feedback.\" If people perceive an organization as unfair or unconcerned about treating them properly, they will be less likely to engage with it and accept its decisions. Consequently, the organization will have to invest time, energy, and money in dealing with appeals, litigation, and the costs of non-compliance. Conversely, if stakeholders feel heard and fairly treated, they are more likely to accept the organization's actions and decisions. By being responsive to complaints and implementing the ombudsman's recommendations to address systemic issues, a public sector body can demonstrate its commitment to fairness and sound administration, thereby enhancing the public's faith and confidence in the organization.\n\nIt is common for an ombudsman's systemic investigation to tackle an issue that middle management is already aware of and would like to rectify but lacks the necessary resources. Once the ombudsman's report becomes public, resources often become available, and leadership is grateful for the ombudsman's intervention. This can be described as a \"win-win-win\" outcome."}]}

complaints to the provincial ombudsman. This is not new for residents of B.C., New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon, as their ombudsmen have long had jurisdiction over municipalities. However, in Ontario, this marks the beginning of a new era of accountability at the local level. The passing of \"Bill 8\" opens up the broader public sector to independent oversight for the first time.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, an ombudsman is an independent official who investigates complaints from the public about maladministration in government. In Ontario, the ombudsman is one of seven independent officers of the legislature who oversee various aspects of the provincial government. Last year alone, the ombudsman's office handled over 23,000 complaints, assisting citizens with a wide range of issues. However, complaints about the \"mush\" sector, which includes municipalities, universities, school boards, hospitals, long-term care facilities, police, and children's aid societies, have been outside the office's jurisdiction since the appointment of Ontario's first ombudsman in 1975.\n\nThe ombudsman's office has had to turn away over 24,000 \"mush\" complaints since 2005, with over 10,500 of those relating to municipalities. This makes municipalities the most complained-about area within the sector. Citizens have expressed frustration at the lack of independent review for their local concerns. However, as of January 1, that will change.\n\nNow is a good time to address some common questions regarding the role of the ombudsman's office. The office accepts complaints through various channels, such as email, fax, web form, telephone, and in person. There are no fees for complainants, and all services are free of charge, as the office is funded through the provincial treasury. Complaints are treated confidentially, and investigations are conducted privately. The ombudsman's staff will assess each complaint, referring it to existing accountability mechanisms whenever possible. If the issue cannot be resolved locally, the ombudsman may intervene and request more information from the municipality. The ombudsman's team will conduct independent investigations when necessary and issue recommendations to improve government administration, service, and accountability.\n\nThe ombudsman's office is known for its large-scale systemic investigations, resulting in published reports and recommendations that have been accepted and implemented by the provincial government since 2005. For instance, the municipal property assessment corporation underwent significant changes in 2006 based on the ombudsman's recommendations. Hydro One also addressed billing and customer service problems following the ombudsman's investigation in 2015. However, the majority of cases are resolved informally and quickly, usually within two weeks.

Our dedicated efforts are evident in the stories and statistics presented in this report. From April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022, we handled a total of 25,161 cases, including complaints and inquiries, which marks a 25% increase compared to the previous fiscal year. While a substantial number of these cases were related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such as vaccine mandates in educational institutions and delays in provincial programs, a significant portion involved complex administrative issues that have always been our specialization. These included assisting families in accessing developmental services or social benefits.\n\nAs usual, we managed to resolve the majority of these cases without formal investigations, with 52% of them being resolved within two weeks. Our priority remains assisting vulnerable individuals who face challenges within unfair systems. For instance, we advocated for Ontarians with disabilities who were unable to renew their health cards online due to a lack of driver's licenses, resulting in a change in the system. We also provided support to inmates in accessing healthcare services and facilitated the process for Ukrainian refugees from the war-torn country in obtaining Ontario driver's licenses.\n\nIn addition to our casework, we published two investigative reports this spring. One report focused on French language services at Laurentian University, while the other addressed the sudden closure of youth justice programs in northern Ontario. All of our recommendations in both cases were accepted. Our progress on two complex systemic investigations, concerning delays at the landlord and tenant board and the government's monitoring of long-term care homes during the pandemic, has been substantial, and we anticipate their completion in the near future.\n\nWithin the municipal sector, we received a record number of complaints as municipalities grappled with the legal and technical aspects of virtual and hybrid meetings while adhering to the open meeting requirements outlined in the Municipal Act, 2001. To assist municipalities, we issued numerous reports and letters that contribute to our comprehensive online database of decisions in our open meeting digest.\n\nRegarding our broader mandate since 2016, general issues related to municipalities generated a significant number of cases. While questions surrounding the role of the ombudsman are not new, recent years have witnessed notable progress in the international recognition of this position as crucial to democracy. The Venice Principles, a set of 25 global standards ensuring the stability, independence, and effectiveness of ombudsman institutions worldwide, were proclaimed in 2019 and subsequently endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2020. These declarations, outlined in detail in the following section of this report, play a vital role in establishing global standards and protections for the ombudsman institution. They enhance our ability to promote fair administration, human rights, good governance, and the rule of law. Together with my international colleagues, I continue to collaborate on informing governments, citizens, and stakeholders about these principles, and we strive to implement them through self-assessment and peer review.\n\nIn May 2022, I had the pleasure of joining my fellow members of the International Ombudsman Institute's Board of Directors for our annual meeting in New York. This in-person gathering, our first in three years, allowed us to have productive sessions with several missions and permanent representatives to the United Nations. We focused on promoting the resolution and the Venice Principles while strengthening our ties with the UN. This progress serves as a hopeful and fitting sign for a world that is eager to overcome the challenges of the past two years.\n\nThroughout this challenging period, reports like the one presented here demonstrate the crucial importance of independent oversight of public services in protecting citizens. It is equally vital to safeguard the concept of independent oversight itself."}]}

Our purpose is to support NYC in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a project called \"Localizing the SDGs.\" Launched in 2019 at the Center for Sustainable Business (CSB) at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business, Invest NYC SDG is a multi-year initiative that aims to create a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban economy in NYC.\n\nBy using the UN SDGs as a framework, we facilitate projects by engaging various stakeholders, including government, private sector, and community organizations, to address major challenges such as reducing carbon emissions, promoting equitable and sustainable urban mobility, and tackling food insecurity. Although we are housed at an academic institution, Invest NYC SDG is not solely a research project. While research serves as the foundation, our main objective is to leverage NYU's influence and convening power to foster collaboration among different sectors, including public, private, philanthropic, social, and academic, with the aim of accelerating the development of new sustainable businesses and organizations in NYC.\n\nAs the first city to align its sustainability goals with the UN SDGs, NYC has laid a crucial groundwork. Invest NYC SDG builds on this foundation and seeks to drive progress. Our focus is on identifying private-sector business and finance opportunities that align with government policies, have significant interested stakeholders, offer realistic business incentives, engage communities, and make a substantial impact in achieving the SDGs. Through concrete projects in NYC, we also aim to identify necessary government policies and financial innovations. In doing so, we are creating a roadmap and toolkit that can be used by other cities, both in the US and internationally, to undertake the SDGs with strong private-sector support.\n\nCollaboration between the private and public sectors, at both regional and local government levels, is essential for systemic change. New York City's long-term strategic plan, OnNYC 2050, and the Green New Deal, were developed in alignment with the UN SDGs. However, realizing this change requires engagement and cooperation between the two sectors. The opportunities for collaboration are abundant, as highlighted by the UN Business and Sustainable Development Commission's report, which identified $12 trillion in business opportunities through multi-stakeholder interaction.\n\nEffective private-sector investment in advancing the SDGs necessitates an understanding that the focus areas of this project heavily rely on public infrastructure, which is owned and operated by public entities. This infrastructure requires ongoing management and maintenance within evolving physical and financial environments. Governmental action faces real constraints, including regulations that can hinder partnerships with the private sector for innovative projects and policies. Nevertheless, systemic policy and operational changes can be achieved.\n\nThe NYU Center for Sustainable Business provides the platform for multi-stakeholder engagement. As a reputable research university trusted by public and private stakeholders, NYU brings together a diverse academic community with various departments actively involved in SDG issues. Leveraging these resources, the NYU Stern CSB connects key stakeholders from the public sector, interest organizations, and the private sector, including corporate and finance sectors, to develop a shared vision on how private-sector investment can be stimulated in collaboration with the public and non-governmental sectors."}]}

Pulses, such as beans, peas, and lentils, are now increasingly being grown alongside wheat, expanding the range of crops produced. While wheat remains a significant crop, pulses have grown in size and importance, accounting for millions of acres of cropland in Canada and contributing significantly to agricultural revenues.\n\nRory McAlpine, an expert in the agribusiness industry, highlighted the positive economic benefits of diversifying into pulse crops during a recent event in New York City hosted by Invest in Canada. Pulse crops, as dry, edible seeds from the legume family, play a crucial role in the rapidly expanding plant protein industry. Canada leads the world as the largest exporter of pulses, emphasizing their importance in creating a future of healthy, delicious, and sustainably produced food.\n\nAt the Future Food-Tech Alternative Proteins Summit, Mr. McAlpine joined Invest in Canada CEO Laurel Broten to discuss the advantages of alternative proteins that make Canada an attractive destination for agri-food investors globally. When asked about Canada's success in dominating the pulse export market with a 39% global market share, Mr. McAlpine attributed it to sustainability. Adding pulse crops has led to real sustainability benefits, including their climate resilience and ability to improve carbon sequestration. Pulse Canada's work in measuring the carbon sequestration of specific pulse crops in Canada has provided valuable data, equating the impact to removing millions of cars from the road.\n\nWhile cultivating the right crops is essential for industry prosperity and environmental sustainability, Mr. McAlpine highlighted the significance of Canada's labor force in unlocking value-added agriculture opportunities. The talent pool built on the foundation of agri-food, science, and innovation plays a vital role in shaping the future of the industry. Canada possesses a dual advantage of strong population growth and high-quality education to meet the diverse workforce needs. Mr. McAlpine emphasized that the industry requires not only highly skilled workers but also semi-skilled and low-skilled individuals to ensure a comprehensive value chain approach.\n\nCanada's educational system, ranked as the best in the world for tertiary education by the OECD, complements the country's high population growth among G7 nations. With one million new Canadians in a single year, the rate of immigration is extraordinary, making Canada an attractive destination for global talent.\n\nOverall, Canada's agri-food industry, embracing the growth of pulses, sustainability, and a diverse and skilled labor force, is well-positioned to meet the demands of the future and attract investors from around the world."}]}

Over the next few years, he will consult with staff and faculty, providing guidance and answering questions to help the university establish policies and guidelines for the use of AI and machine-learning systems in various areas. Dr. Blouin emphasizes that AI is not solely a technological issue, but rather a people issue. It is crucial to determine where it is appropriate and ethical to delegate automation and decision-making to algorithms and software systems. In an academic setting like a university, where knowledge dissemination is key, it is vital to involve everyone in this conversation.\n\nDr. Blouin has already conducted meetings and presentations with several faculties and faculty councils on this topic, with more to come. His initial focus is to create a guidance document for fall courses, specifically addressing the consideration of AI tools, such as large-language models. The aim is to provide pedagogical support and guidance, encouraging discussion and engagement among faculty members.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Blouin is working towards helping Dal prepare for an AI-informed digital future, where change occurs rapidly. He wants to ensure that the university is prepared for new developments and has the necessary processes and personnel to carefully consider opportunities and challenges. Collaboration and interdisciplinary decision-making are crucial in this endeavor.\n\nWhile AI may still evoke science fiction associations like Terminator or The Matrix, its current application is not about creating artificial consciousness. Instead, it involves computer processes that analyze vast amounts of data to perform specific tasks efficiently. The intelligence of AI lies in its ability to perform tasks that were traditionally associated with human capabilities, such as writing complex text or creating realistic images. AI tools enable computer software to perform these tasks at a higher quality level than ever before.\n\nThe use of these AI tools can be overwhelming initially. Dr. Blouin mentions the chat GPT tool developed by OpenAI as an example. It exercises strong analytical skills, challenging the notion that humans have exclusive control over such abilities. However, these big-data systems can also be highly beneficial. They work rapidly on a large scale, automating tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming. Dr. Blouin provides an example of summarizing a 90-page proposal, which a large language tool can do in seconds, saving hours of manual reading and note-taking. Nonetheless, critical decisions should never be solely based on the output of these tools.\n\nOverall, Dr. Blouin's work at Dal revolves around fostering a collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to AI implementation. By considering the ethical implications, empowering individuals, and leveraging AI tools effectively, Dal aims to embrace the opportunities and challenges of an AI-influenced digital future."}]}

Akhade was surprised because Roche had withdrawn the drug for this purpose in the United States, although it is still approved to treat other types of cancer. Atezolizumab had been made available for this type of breast cancer in 2019 through the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated approval program. Accelerated approval is a fast-track process designed to make necessary drugs available to patients more quickly than conventional drug approval processes allow. However, a follow-up study showed that Atezolizumab had little impact on tumor growth and that patients who received it were less likely to survive up to two years after treatment compared to those who didn't take it. When the FDA received this data in 2021, it concluded that accelerated approval was no longer appropriate, and Roche withdrew the drug for this particular form of breast cancer. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Amsterdam also followed suit, but the drug remained approved for triple-negative breast cancer in India, where Roche continued to promote its use until at least September. Akhade found this \"quite shocking\" and emphasized the need for consistent treatment worldwide. Genentech, the Roche subsidiary that developed Atezolizumab, stated that the drug is still approved in 100 countries for triple-negative breast cancer and that they comply with all local healthcare authorities' regulations and requirements. The accelerated approval process in the United States is based on clinical studies that suggest a health benefit, even if not fully demonstrated. It prioritizes speed over certainty and requires companies to conduct follow-up studies to confirm the treatment's benefits. While this compromise is considered reasonable as long as confirmatory evidence is obtained quickly and reliably, the program has faced controversy due to complications. Companies do not always conduct follow-up studies in a timely manner, and the FDA has not consistently enforced them. The time taken to withdraw a drug that fails to hold up in confirmatory studies can range from four years to decades. Some high-profile accelerated approvals, such as the approval of the Alzheimer's disease drug Aducanumab, have raised concerns about insufficient evidence, leading to protests from FDA advisors. Experts also worry that the process allows companies to market expensive drugs for rare childhood diseases to desperate parents without sufficient evidence. Currently, there are nearly 200 cancer treatments approved through this pathway, with 26 being withdrawn after follow-up studies and 68 still awaiting confirmatory evidence. A significant number of prescriptions can be issued between a drug's accelerated approval and the publication of follow-up results. Even if the results are negative, the drug may continue to be prescribed, particularly when recommended by professional medical bodies. The impact of accelerated approvals extends beyond US borders, as many countries use FDA decisions to influence their own regulatory policies. The problem, according to bioethicist Holly Fernandez Lynch at the University of Pennsylvania, lies in a failure of communication regarding the outcomes of follow-up studies and the nature of accelerated approval itself. Clinicians and patients often view FDA approval as a binary decision, but it is a more complex process."}]}

This rare opportunity allowed students in the seaside summer shark course to closely observe one of the ocean's most endangered creatures and aid in the investigation of its cause of death. Emma Martin, a fourth-year marine biology student, expressed her excitement at being able to witness the procedure and learn from the experienced experts in the room. She chose Dalhousie University specifically for its biology and conservation of sharks program and was thrilled to finally see a great white shark in person and understand the anthropogenic factors contributing to their decline. The shark, a 2.76-meter male estimated to be around seven years old, was recovered by the Marine Animal Response Society (MARS), a charitable conservation group focused on marine species protection. Thanks to Tonya Wimmer, MARS's executive director and a graduate of Dalhousie's marine biology program, who received a call about the shark, it was collected under their species at risk act permit with the assistance of scientists from the University of Windsor. The necropsy was then organized by MARS for the Dalhousie shark class, with the support of Chris Harvey-Clark, Dalhousie's veterinarian and one of the course instructors. During the two-hour procedure, the team meticulously examined the shark's body for any signs of the cause of death, providing the students with a thorough understanding of the shark's anatomy. Students had the opportunity to handle the heart, assist in dissecting various organs, examine the liver, pancreas, spleen, thyroid, and observe the brain's recess. The shark's stomach, which was distended from being full, revealed remnants of a small harbor porpoise that had been bitten into large, identifiable pieces. Adam Bouma, a fourth-year marine biology student, emphasized the importance of this hands-on experience, stating that it would enhance his understanding and contribute to future job interviews. He noted that not many undergraduate students have the chance to witness a great white shark necropsy, making it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Additionally, the collected tissue samples will serve as a valuable resource for researchers from various organizations who rarely have the opportunity to study great whites post-mortem. Manuel Dureuil, one of the course instructors, expressed his satisfaction at being part of an event that even many shark researchers wouldn't have the chance to participate in. He highlighted the motivation behind providing this experience to the 18 passionate marine biologists, emphasizing the connection it creates between hands-on science and sharks. Wimmer, who completed her master's in biology at Dalhousie, believes that witnessing such a necropsy could ignite a lifelong interest in marine studies for some students. She praised Dalhousie for offering field courses that enhance the learning experience and attract students who are passionate about marine research."}]}

perspective, international research experience is not simply an addition to her academic career, but rather an essential component. Bohdana believes that students in Ukraine require support from supervisors and teachers worldwide in order to achieve their dreams in a practical manner. Currently, Bohdana is working as a summer research intern alongside Dr. Richard Price and his team at Dalhousie's Faculty of Dentistry. Their research focuses on identifying differences in dental curing lights. Dr. Price is a renowned researcher in this field and serves as a professor in the Department of Dental Clinical Sciences and the School of Biomedical Engineering.\n\nAfter completing her dental education in Ukraine, Bohdana pursued a master's degree and expressed a desire to engage in research opportunities abroad. It was through her friend, Yaryna Tylchak, that Bohdana learned about Dr. Price's search for a summer intern. Upon expressing her interest, Bohdana was offered the internship by Dr. Price, who successfully secured funding through Mitacs Globalink and Research Nova Scotia's Ukrainian Emergency Research Support Program.\n\nBohdana expresses deep appreciation for the support she has received from Dr. Price, the lab members, Research Nova Scotia, and Mitacs. She views this opportunity as a tremendous chance for personal growth, emphasizing her desire to make a positive impact not only in scientific research but also in practical applications that benefit end-users. Curing lights play a vital role in the dental field, as they are used daily by dentists to cure adhesives, harden fillings, cement crowns, and bond brackets onto teeth. In 2014 alone, approximately 800 million fillings required the use of a curing light. Ensuring the proper curing of dental materials is crucial to prevent inadequate polymerization and premature failure.\n\nThrough this internship, Bohdana has gained firsthand experience in testing and evaluating various curing lights in Dr. Price's laboratory. She has discovered that not all curing lights are equal, and they yield different outcomes. Surprisingly, many dentists are unaware of these significant differences and often base their purchasing decisions on factors such as usability, brand reputation, cost, and warranty period. Bohdana's survey in Ukraine revealed that only a small percentage of dentists consider factors like irradiance, emission spectrum, and beam profile when selecting curing lights. Dr. Price remarks that this lack of awareness among dentists does not surprise him, as numerous studies have consistently shown limited knowledge in this area.\n\nBohdana's three-month stay in Nova Scotia has been made possible by the support of Research Nova Scotia's Ukrainian Emergency Research Support Program, which has also provided funding for the necessary research equipment. Stefan Leslie, CEO of Research Nova Scotia, emphasizes that their program aims to support Ukrainian researchers working in Nova Scotia while producing valuable research outcomes. Bohdana's research has the potential to improve dental practices and patient outcomes not only in Nova Scotia and Ukraine but also beyond.\n\nWorking closely with Dr. Price, Bohdana has learned how to measure the output and analyze the differences of curing lights, as well as test their outcomes. They plan to submit at least one research article for publication based on Bohdana's work in Canada. Additionally, Dr. Price has arranged for Bohdana to visit Ultradent, a major dental company in the United States, where she will present her research findings before returning to Ukraine to complete her master's program. Bohdana is eager to share her research findings at student dental conferences and hopes to contribute further to the field by submitting another paper.\n\nBohdana looks forward to bringing her research findings back to Ukraine and utilizing her experience in organizing student dental conferences to disseminate her work. She believes that her time in Canada, specifically at Dalhousie with Dr. Price, has provided her with a valuable professional growth opportunity. Ultimately, Bohdana aims to contribute to the dental industry in Ukraine and attract greater investments for a better future. She firmly believes that in Ukraine, regardless of one's profession or role, every action taken each day is done with the goal of building a brighter future."}]}

As an education and outreach scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, Lepo enthusiastically supports the James Webb Space Telescope by communicating its discoveries to the public. She also plays a role in managing the institute's systems and scheduling telescope time for scientists.\n\nLepo's time at U of T was instrumental in developing her skills in public outreach as a teaching assistant and gaining exposure as a trusted expert in the field of astronomy. She learned how to effectively educate large audiences and convey complex theories about the universe. The esteemed university provided her with an exceptional learning experience, surrounded by top astronomers in a nurturing environment. Lepo vividly recalls the moment she arrived in Toronto and realized she was at one of the world's leading universities.\n\nDuring her PhD research, Lepo focused on investigating stars that have the potential to explode as supernovae. She aimed to determine whether these explosions were caused by the collision of two white dwarf stars or the transfer of mass from one star to another. Working with telescope operators in Chile and Australia, Lepo collected data from numerous stars in the small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. While she couldn't find concrete evidence of supernovae caused by mass transfer, her work made significant contributions to the field. Supernovae have been crucial in understanding the expansion history of the universe, revealing that not only is the universe expanding, but it is also accelerating in its expansion. Ultimately, this could mean that galaxies will eventually become so far apart that we will live in isolated \"island universes.\"\n\nProfessor Marten van Kerkwijk, Lepo's PhD advisor, commends her efficiency and dedication as an astronomer. He recognizes the value of her research and appreciates the work she accomplished during her studies. Additionally, in 2013, Lepo played a pivotal role in organizing the first-ever West African International Summer School for Young Astronomers, a program partly supported by the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA). Lepo also established herself as a trusted voice in astronomy, debunking myths surrounding the ancient Mayan prophecy of a doomsday in 2012. She refuted claims of deadly solar flares and impending collisions with runaway planets, all while being involved in teaching an interdisciplinary course on the apocalypse in the Arts & Science program.\n\nFor her exceptional achievements both inside and outside the classroom, Lepo received the Fieldus Award in 2014, which recognizes graduate students who demonstrate excellence in leadership, teaching, and research. Following her graduation, she taught physics at Gonzaga University before becoming the first coordinator of the McGill Space Institute at McGill University. Regardless of her career path, Lepo always emphasizes her deep-rooted passion for public outreach, attributing much of it to her time at U of T. She fondly remembers an occasion where she and her colleagues set up solar telescopes on the St. George campus, encouraging people to safely observe the sun. These moments, where individuals were astonished to learn that the sun is larger than the moon, were particularly rewarding for Lepo."}]}

However, this ongoing $1.5 billion project has also caused disruption and faced financial and political challenges. It now receives mixed reviews from the residents it was intended to assist.\n\nShauna Brail, an associate professor and director of the Institute for Management & Innovation at the University of Toronto Mississauga, acknowledges the project's difficulties but believes that Regent Park is now an improved neighborhood compared to its state in 1999 or 2006. As an economic geographer and urban planner, Brail has been studying the redevelopment since its inception in 2006. She recently published an examination of the project with Toronto journalist and University of Toronto alumnus John Lorinc.\n\nOriginally built as public housing in the late 1940s, Regent Park had 2,083 subsidized units on 69 acres. By the 1990s, the housing was in disrepair, and the neighborhood faced crime and stigma. Meanwhile, federal funding for social housing decreased while land values increased. The Toronto Community Housing Corp. (TCHC) decided to finance the redevelopment through \"financialization,\" which involved building and selling some housing at market prices to generate funds for new subsidized housing. The goal was to create a mixed-income neighborhood with a strong sense of community and shared amenities.\n\nDuring the reconstruction, existing tenants were relocated but offered the opportunity to return, and approximately half have done so. Brail was interested in the extent to which low-income community residents could influence the redevelopment process. She discovered that they empowered themselves, providing input on planning and advocating for resources and funding for parks, social centers, jobs, and training. However, the community remains divided on the outcomes, with some residents believing the redevelopment is unquestionably better and others feeling that it has destroyed community bonds.\n\nBrail and Lorinc's paper outlines the political, financial, and social complexities that have delayed the project by nearly 20 years, including the election of the late Mayor Rob Ford and his cost-cutting measures. The redevelopment is now five to eight years behind schedule, with two of the five phases still unfinished. Brail's research also explores how the rising value of downtown real estate influenced planners' approach to public housing, shifting their reliance from public funding to self-financing projects. However, financialization alone did not cover the full cost of Regent Park's redevelopment, with the three levels of government contributing approximately $500 million thus far.\n\nOne of the main lessons learned from this project is that redevelopment comes at a cost. The financialized model, while beneficial, is not sufficient on its own. Governments still need to carefully consider how to fund public housing and should be encouraged to do so."}]}

This particular episode features insightful discussions with students, educators, and a social worker. It raises essential questions about the actions that governments, corporations, and individuals should take in response to the alarming news surrounding the climate crisis.\n\nWhat sets this podcast apart is the enthusiastic and passionate host who guides the conversation. The heartfelt opinions shared by the group make for a compelling listening experience. Remarkably, the entire episode was created by Elijah Miller, a Grade 12 student who took on the roles of writer, producer, interviewer, and music composer. Miller's involvement in this project is a testament to the exceptional opportunities provided by the Support, Engage, Experience U of T (SEE U of T) program.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with the Toronto District School Board and spearheaded by Woodsworth College since 2019, SEE U of T aims to give students from historically under-represented communities a taste of university life. This program has now expanded to cover all three U of T campuses. Local Grade 11 and 12 students are invited to complete a first-year U of T course at no charge, participate in a co-op placement, receive mentoring from senior undergraduates, and explore the university's facilities and services. In return, participants earn two high school co-op credits and a half-credit towards a university degree.\n\nThe main objective of SEE U of T is to remove barriers that stem from structural and historical inequities, creating pathways to post-secondary education. U of T not only seeks to attract students who have been traditionally under-represented but also wants them to feel a genuine sense of belonging within the university community. This initiative was a collaborative effort involving Ann Lopez, U of T's Provostial Advisor on Access Programs, Cheryl Shook (Woodsworth's then-Assistant Principal and Registrar), and principals and staff at the participating high schools, Runnymede Collegiate Institute and Downsview Secondary School.\n\nU of T has recently redoubled its efforts to foster a more inclusive environment for black students. In 2020, the university established the U of T Institutional Anti-Black Racism Task Force, whose comprehensive report in the following year yielded 56 recommendations to promote black inclusion and excellence across the tri-campus community. U of T has accepted and implemented many of these recommendations and continues to work on the others.\n\nParticipants in SEE U of T have the opportunity to choose from a selection of 16 courses. In addition to support from course instructors and teaching assistants, students can seek guidance from an academic advisor dedicated to their cohort and a learning strategist at Woodsworth's Academic Writing Centre. Co-op placements are available at numerous academic and administrative sites, offering valuable hands-on experience. U of T covers tuition fees and books, while the school board typically provides additional support such as bus tickets and meals. This program plays a crucial role in leveling the playing field for learning opportunities and contributes to a more inclusive society, as affirmed by Natasha Jesenak, Director of Access Programs and Registrarial Services at Woodsworth.\n\nTo date, over 50 high school students have participated in SEE U of T across three cohorts. While the pandemic limited participation in online activities, the program will fully resume in-person this fall. U of T Mississauga also piloted its own version of SEE U of T in partnership with the Peel District School Board and two participating schools, Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School and Meadowvale Secondary School. Known as SEE UTM, this program offers a course focused on critical thinking in science and technology, equipping students with valuable life skills. Workshops on topics such as discovering strengths and personal finance were also provided. Participants had the opportunity to benefit from 20 hours of one-on-one mentorship with undergraduate mentors who assisted with essential skills such as time management, creating LinkedIn profiles, and applying to university.\n\nTobi Mohammed, a fourth-year Biology for Health Sciences student, served as both a mentor and teaching assistant for the science and technology course. Mohammed's mentorship involved discussing her mentees' ambitions, goals, personal struggles, and providing guidance on various aspects of university life. She believes that a program like SEE U of T would have greatly benefited her during her first year at U of T, particularly as a black student.\n\nOverall, the SEE U of T program and its extension to UTM demonstrate U of T's commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. By offering valuable educational experiences, mentorship opportunities, and support services, U of T is actively working towards removing barriers and fostering a more equitable society."}]}

When Christina Guzzo was completing her PhD and seeking a mentor to further her training, she aimed for the best. Guzzo desired to experience the cutting edge and work with Anthony Fauci's esteemed research team. Fauci, known for leading the world-renowned HIV research center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was approached by Guzzo at an AIDS conference. Impressed by Guzzo's intelligence, energy, and dedication, Fauci agreed to interview her for a competitive post-doctoral position at the research center. Recognizing her passion and purpose to utilize science for the betterment of society, Fauci hired her.\n\nIn the following five years, Guzzo thrived in the intense and demanding environment of the lab, advancing HIV research. While she always intended to return to Canada, Fauci warmly expressed his desire for her to stay indefinitely due to her productivity, insightfulness, and creativity. Currently, Guzzo, now 38, runs her own lab as a professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough in the Department of Biological Sciences. She recognizes the importance of mentorship, especially for young women who may feel excluded or biased against. Guzzo shares her belief in her students, particularly her female students, providing encouragement and support. Additionally, she volunteers for Sparking Science, a program aimed at inspiring high school girls to pursue careers in science and technology by connecting them with female scientists who serve as mentors. Guzzo also emphasizes the importance of work-life balance and openly discusses her own need for time off for family matters, creating a supportive environment for her students to do the same when necessary. Despite the absence of science mentors during her high school and undergraduate years, Guzzo discovered her passion for science while participating in a student-led organization focused on HIV-AIDS education. This experience, coupled with her encounter with Katrina Gee, a friendly and newly hired professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Queen's University, solidified Guzzo's path as a scientist. Under Gee's guidance, Guzzo not only made significant contributions to research but also learned the importance of enjoying the journey and celebrating both major and minor accomplishments."}]}

This innovative approach combines the expertise of SickKids clinicians with specially trained AI, potentially leading to significantly improved health outcomes. Additionally, it has the potential to alleviate the demands on clinicians' time and reduce stress on the healthcare system.\n\nMjaye Mazwi, a staff physician at SickKids and an associate professor at U of T's Temerty Faculty of Medicine, stated, \"This could help some of our most vulnerable patients while also reducing stress on the healthcare system.\" When the heart functions properly, it beats with a regular rhythm, as seen on a heart monitor. However, a heartbeat that is too fast, too slow, or chaotic can result in severe complications and even death. Heart rhythm anomalies affect almost one in three children admitted to SickKids' intensive care unit, impacting up to 700 children annually. These patients require continuous monitoring, which places a significant burden on hospital staff who are simultaneously caring for other patients.\n\nSebastian Goodfellow, an assistant professor in U of T's Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering and a principal investigator at the Lassonde Institute of Mining, explained the challenge faced by clinicians. He stated, \"The challenge is that clinicians cannot continuously monitor every bedside.\" This can result in delays in detecting or diagnosing abnormal heart rhythms, leading to worse outcomes for patients. To address this, Goodfellow and Mazwi are developing a potentially game-changing solution.\n\nGoodfellow's previous experience in building AI models to analyze geological data for patterns made him a natural collaborator. The AI being developed is being trained to recognize warning signs of impending arrhythmias based on clinicians' expertise and over 10,000 electrocardiogram readings. This far surpasses the exposure even the most experienced clinicians would encounter throughout their careers. Before being used with patients, the AI must match or exceed the performance of a clinician and accurately alert healthcare professionals when arrhythmia warning signs appear.\n\nMazwi emphasized the goal of creating collaborative intelligence between AI and human expertise. He stated, \"We don't believe that AI will replace clinicians, but we do believe that clinicians who use AI will outperform and replace clinicians who do not.\" The initial focus of the research is on a specific type of irregular cardiac activity called junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET), which is challenging to detect due to subtle changes in the patient's electrocardiogram. Early detection and treatment of JET are crucial in reducing the risk of injury or death, as well as shortening the patient's hospital or ICU stay.\n\nWhile AI is rapidly advancing in various areas, including medicine, Mazwi highlighted the cautious and deliberate process in healthcare. AI models must undergo extensive testing to ensure they improve patient outcomes and overall performance in the healthcare system before being used on actual patients. The research team at U of T and SickKids is collaborating with clinicians and researchers at other pediatric hospitals worldwide to test the AI models being developed in Toronto.

icebergs, and heatwaves. Unfortunately, the proposed solutions to combat climate change can seem burdensome, such as reducing driving or flying while paying higher prices for gas and energy. It is no surprise then that Canada's progress in addressing climate change has been slow.\n\nHowever, there is renewed enthusiasm in climate politics due to the introduction of a \"Green New Deal\" by activists and progressive politicians. This initiative aims to mobilize government resources on a massive scale to decarbonize society while also ensuring the well-being of workers in carbon-based industries. This reframing of climate change solutions as a win-win situation has gained support from a diverse range of individuals, including politicians, labor union leaders, and religious leaders.\n\nThe concept of a Green New Deal has been discussed for about a decade, emphasizing that environmental issues are not solely about the environment. They are also deeply intertwined with problems of economic inequality and social injustice. For instance, marginalized groups such as families living in poverty, people of color, and indigenous peoples bear a disproportionate burden from pollution and fossil fuel extraction. Many indigenous peoples in Canada have strongly opposed projects like the Trans Mountain pipeline due to concerns about harm to waterways, wildlife, sacred sites, and the land they seek to protect. Low-income communities are also more likely to suffer from environmental harms, as a quarter of Canada's poorest population lives within one kilometer of a pollution-emitting facility, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.\n\nLinking climate change with justice and equality can help foster broad political coalitions that support aggressive action. By creating opportunities for people to earn a living wage and addressing the significant income inequality that has arisen in recent decades, we can build stronger support for climate change initiatives.\n\nUnlike the United States, there is no single Green New Deal for Canada. Instead, there are various proposals emerging from different sources. The New Democratic Party (NDP) has outlined \"A New Deal for Climate Action and Good Jobs,\" which calls for urgent climate change measures and the creation of 300,000 green jobs nationwide. The plan also promises financial benefits, such as reduced energy costs through efficiency upgrades and potentially even free public transportation. However, the NDP plan does not provide clear guidance on addressing fossil fuel production beyond supporting workers and ensuring their integration into the changing economy.\n\nActivists and civil society groups have also put forth their own proposals, such as the Pact for a Green New Deal launched by over 100 organizations in May 2019. This pact sets the ambitious goal of reducing Canadian emissions by half within 11 years while prioritizing the protection of cultural and biological diversity.\n\nThe Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change serves as the centerpiece of Canadian climate policy. While carbon pricing is a central component of this framework, it has faced controversy. Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney swiftly repealed carbon pricing laws upon their election, and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe is challenging its legality. Recent court rulings indicate that carbon pricing is here to stay, although it remains a political point of contention. Furthermore, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has stated that the carbon price will be capped at $50 per tonne, which many argue is insufficient to drive the necessary changes.\n\nTo meet Canada's commitments under the Paris Agreement, a complete economic transition is required. The Green New Deal offers environmentally sustainable ideas for this transition that also prioritize economic and social justice. Federal policies are necessary to create new job opportunities for those affected by the closure of tar sands. These policies could include federal procurement policies driving demand for carbon-neutral electricity and buildings, as well as the production and installation of the required technology. Introducing new standards for generating renewable electricity would incentivize the expansion of capacity, and investments in grid upgrades would create additional jobs. Simultaneously, tightening emissions regulations would slow down the use of fossil fuels.\n\nOf course, not all workers can be easily retrained. In these cases, the federal government must act with honesty and generosity. Buyouts and guaranteed pensions would be necessary. Provinces lack both the incentive and the resources to implement such policies, making federal intervention crucial."}]}

elites, minorities, women, and members of the LGBTQ community. Bolsonaro effectively utilized social media to garner support from far-right nationalists. On his first day in office, he issued several executive orders restricting the rights of minority groups. This pattern bears resemblance to the political journeys of figures such as Donald Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Marine Le Pen, the Five Star Movement, and Brexit. Protectionist and anti-immigrant nationalists are dismantling the post-World War II consensus on the importance of pluralism and the free movement of goods and people. Liberal democratic values are currently facing a decline worldwide. To comprehend this trend, we must examine the concerns of the working and middle classes, who fear job automation and outsourcing. Nationalist politicians calm these anxieties by offering apparent solutions like trade barriers to protect employment. Concurrently, they depict political, business, and media elites as puppets manipulated by foreign interests, implying that only they can safeguard the less-educated workforce and protect citizens from the consequences of free trade and migration. These leaders intensify fears surrounding migration to such an extent that their anti-immigrant stance becomes a defining trait. They excel at propagating their message through anonymous forums like Twitter and Facebook, effectively tapping into the emotive power of nationalism, which can inspire both constructive and irrational behavior.

This strategy greatly contributed to his success, as 57% of white Americans voted for him. Counteracting the rise of ethnic nationalism will not be a simple task. It will require long-term social and political changes, as well as immediate adjustments to our participation in politics. Addressing the concerns of the working and middle classes can begin with policies that strengthen social safety nets, reduce inequality, and assist in preparing and retraining workers for jobs in the information-based economy. Experimental studies evaluating the impact of a universal basic income show promise. Such programs offer workers a guaranteed income level regardless of employment status, enabling them to withstand job loss while providing support for retraining. The backing for Brexit is sustained by the belief that the European Union does not adequately represent the interests of ordinary British citizens. Similar distrust or cynicism towards government exists in many countries. Advocates for immigration must effectively convey to the public the logical, regulated, and well-resourced benefits of selection and settlement policies for both migrants and the host society. In Canada, broad support for immigration is largely due to our longstanding points-based model and commitment to language training for recent migrants. High volumes of refugees and irregular immigration pose challenges for the United States and several European states. However, prioritizing the selection of highly skilled migrants could alleviate concerns that they negatively impact the economy and potentially garner public support for more generous immigration policies. Governments should hold social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter accountable for the content posted by their users, similar to mainstream publishers and broadcasters. In essence, social media should be subject to regulation. Some propose that partially embracing the ideas put forth by nationalists is necessary to combat nationalism. Advocates of this approach advocate for protectionist economic policies, reduced immigration, and increased programs aimed at fostering national culture. Their contention is that taking nationalists' ideas seriously is crucial to effectively addressing the grievances of many majority groups worldwide, including Trump's \"true Americans.\""}]}

At that time, Jenkins, the CEO of OpenText, reflects on how our failure against Google allowed us to \"pivot\" and become a leading global software and cloud company. Originally, OpenText aimed to be the primary search engine of the internet, but we fell short. From a Canadian perspective, this is significant because we tend to shy away from failure in the fields of innovation, invention, and competition. OpenText experienced a very public failure, with our stock price plummeting from $20 to $2 in less than six months. Articles were written about the collapse of our business model and the abandonment of our search engine, similar to what has been published about other Canadian companies like BlackBerry, Nortel, and Valeant. This failure was personal and painful, as friends, family, and others in Canada lost significant amounts of money on OpenText stock.\n\nHowever, this failure led to a pivotal moment for OpenText. We shifted our focus to business-to-business applications, a less competitive but equally profitable market compared to public-facing search engines. This strategic shift ultimately led to much greater profitability in the long run. Without this failure and subsequent re-evaluation and pivot, we would not have achieved our current success. This is a vital lesson to remember\u2014no matter what challenges arise, it is crucial to persevere, adapt, evaluate, and pivot with confidence, as success often comes after multiple attempts. Successful entrepreneurs embrace failure as a stepping stone to success. A prime example is Thomas Edison, who is considered a successful entrepreneur and inventor despite numerous failures. Failures are an integral part of the journey toward innovation and achievement.\n\nUnfortunately, Canadians tend to have a narrow view of failure. Canadian companies like Nortel and Research in Motion have experienced high-profile collapses, as have many others. The reality is that failure is a constant presence and an essential part of the innovation process. OpenText was fortunate to change course just in time. We were able to redirect our resources, money, and technologies to a different market and application, leading us to succeed. Although the success of this pivot only became evident years later, OpenText grew in its new business and became a market leader in software development for corporate intranets and the cloud. Today, OpenText is one of the world's largest software and cloud companies, remaining rooted in its hometown of Waterloo. Our headquarters, employing over 12,000 people, stands just a few steps away from where our first internet search product, OpenText Index, was created in 1995."}]}

As someone living in Toronto, there was little I could do besides expressing my condemnation of the shooter through social media. However, this simple gesture led to me becoming the target of hate from numerous Muslims around the world. This unfortunate experience sheds light on the challenges faced by openly gay Muslims.\n\nOne individual wrote a tweet saying, \"I'm sad you weren't in the club in Orlando,\" followed by a \"have a nice day\" message and a smiley emoji. Another person wished for me to get hit by a bus, while another threatened to be among those who would stone me to death. Polite warnings of enduring \"hell\" were also sent my way. As an openly gay Muslim, these reactions have left me terrified of the Muslim community.\n\nAs a Muslim myself, I understand that acts of terror do not reflect the true teachings of Islam. With over 1.6 billion Muslims across the globe, I know that the vast majority are non-violent and share a peaceful disposition, much like myself. However, as a gay man, I find no solace in this fact because I have personally witnessed the prevalence of homophobia within the Muslim community.\n\nMuslims cannot rightfully claim that Islam is a religion of peace if it fosters homophobia. We cannot espouse both notions, as the religion of homophobia inevitably leads to loss of life. This includes not only the brutal acts committed by extremist groups like ISIS, but also the cold-blooded shootings by individuals such as Omar Mateen, and the horrific deaths of LGBTQ individuals within Muslim households. The homophobia prevalent within the Muslim community is responsible for the self-hatred experienced by LGBTQ Muslims, resulting in many individuals taking their own lives. Unfortunately, this is a truth with which I am all too familiar and one that nearly claimed my own life.\n\nDuring my upbringing, I found it easy to deny my homosexuality. My immigrant parents did their best to raise their children in accordance with traditional Bangladeshi Muslim values, which prohibited actions such as consuming pork, alcohol, and engaging in heterosexual dating. In high school, I dismissed my lack of interest in girls as a testament to my obedience and devotion as a son. When I moved to the University of Toronto as an undergraduate student, I attempted to carry those traditional Muslim values with me, including the homophobia I had internalized from the broader Muslim community.\n\nStepping onto campus felt like entering a world that contradicted my beliefs. Rainbow-colored \"positive space\" stickers adorned the hallways, which I found deeply unsettling. I could not comprehend why there were so many LGBTQ individuals openly expressing themselves. However, what I failed to understand then, and what many Muslims still struggle to comprehend, is that being LGBTQ and openly proud challenges one's capacity for empathy. Within the Muslim community, few individuals possess the courage to come out, causing many Muslims to perceive LGBTQ issues as a distant and \"Western\" problem. It is much easier to harbor hate when it remains abstract. However, being confronted with open and proud LGBTQ individuals compelled me to make a choice between hate and love. I chose love, even when I struggled to accept my own homosexuality. I chose love because Allah has 99 names, and bigotry, hate, and homophobia are not among them\u2014but love is.\n\nMany Muslims take pride in their racial and religious identity, despite the fact that embracing this identity can make us targets of racism and Islamophobia. What many Muslims fail to realize is that LGBTQ individuals also carry a similar sense of pride, even in the face of homophobia, transphobia, and biphobia. Omar Mateen's act of terrorism serves as a grim reminder that being openly gay and proud can still cost us our lives. As a proud and openly gay Muslim, I understand that I am a target within the Muslim community. It may even cost me my life one day. However, by being open and proud of who I am, I force Muslims to make a choice. They must choose between loving me or hating me. If they choose love, they will see that the LGBTQ community and the Muslim community share common truths. Both communities value the sanctity of life and desire to live in a world characterized by tolerance and acceptance."}]}

I proudly marked each new destination on a world map, symbolizing my accomplishments. However, I also became fascinated by the idea that this map would not exist if it weren't for courageous explorers who ventured into the unknown and documented their findings. When I arrived at U of T in 1988, I met Alex Jones, a classics professor who seemed to sense my curiosity. He suggested that I explore the history of cartography, a subject perfectly suited to my interests.\n\nDuring my time at U of T's Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, I had the privilege of conducting extensive research on the history of maps and exploration during the medieval period. Early maps not only depict lands and seas but also offer insight into how earlier civilizations perceived the world. Their maps were constructed based on exploration, as well as myth, hearsay, and speculation, often differing greatly from our own understanding.\n\nYears after graduating, I stumbled upon a collection of rare early maps and texts owned by a private collector. These maps fascinated me due to their unique background. They had been brought to the United States by an Italian immigrant named Marcian F. Rossi and were now in possession of one of his descendants. Rossi traced his lineage back to an admiral who had known Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant famous for his extensive travels across Asia between 1271 and 1295. Although these maps had been briefly mentioned in a 1940s article, no detailed study had been conducted, presenting an exceptional opportunity for me to delve into this subject.\n\nThus began years of investigation and analysis, including the daunting task of translating fragments of Latin, medieval Italian, and even Chinese found on the documents. These documents, inked on vellum, reveal an unknown history of Marco Polo. One text describes a \"land of frost\" and \"sea lions,\" referring to the far reaches of Northeast Asia, which coincides with certain depictions on the maps \u2013 a region absent from the traditional Marco Polo narrative. The same text also mentions a \"remote peninsula washed by the seas,\" where people reside in caves due to extreme cold. Such descriptions, along with certain illustrations on the maps, suggest early knowledge of the western shores of North America, possibly predating Columbus by two centuries. Furthermore, the documents imply charting of the northern Pacific Ocean and potentially even parts of Alaska, five centuries before the Russians embarked on their initial expeditions there.\n\nThe quantity of materials, consisting of approximately 14 maps and texts, and the multitude of connections within and between them, further add to the intrigue and complexity of this investigation. With the recent publication of my book, \"The Mysteries of the Marco Polo Maps\" in 2014, a broader audience now has the opportunity to appreciate the beauty and intricacy of these maps, as well as the contributions made by merchants and explorers like Marco Polo in expanding our knowledge of distant lands. I like to believe that my own travels, which eventually included several years in Asia after graduate school, are a reflection of Polo's insatiable curiosity about the world beyond his humble beginnings."}]}

My parents frequently changed churches, seeking one that suited them, never staying at one for more than a few years. Every Sunday morning, my parents struggled to persuade me to attend. I am unsure if this was due to my rebellious nature during adolescence or my genuine disinterest in church, or both. Nonetheless, I grew up dismissing religion in general and, at times, even resenting it. Nevertheless, I remained intrigued by those who found religion deeply significant. I never imagined that I would become a journalist covering this subject.\n\nIn 2008, I commenced my undergraduate studies at Trinity College. I enrolled in a course on religion and human rights, which included content on the Dhammayietra \u2013 annual peace walks led by Cambodian Buddhist monks. These walks were established in 1992 as a means to restore order to a nation devastated by the Khmer Rouge. Learning about the Dhammayietra challenged my preconceived notions about religion and shed light on the intricate forces behind religious beliefs and their potential for cultivating peace in times of despair. After completing the course, I switched my major from English to religion and reevaluated my lifelong aspiration of attending law school. All I knew was that I desired a career connected to religion, although I remained uncertain about the specifics.\n\nDuring my final year, I interned at the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, an organization that utilizes religion to combat extremism. I assisted with Faiths Act, an international interfaith fellowship program, where individuals from diverse religious and non-religious backgrounds collaborated on projects related to the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. While Mr. Blair has faced significant criticism, particularly recently due to his involvement in Middle East affairs and the News of the World phone hacking scandal, I firmly believe that his objective of promoting religion as a force for good holds value. Inspired by the foundation's work in human rights, I pursued a master's degree in human rights at the London School of Economics in 2012. For my dissertation, I focused on Christian efforts to combat human trafficking in the United States, a topic that garners substantial attention and funding, yet remains subject to ongoing debate regarding its efficacy.\n\nDuring my field research, I encountered compelling and often heart-wrenching stories from survivors of human trafficking and individuals working in anti-human-trafficking organizations. While I was able to incorporate some of these narratives into my final paper, I felt dissatisfied with confining them solely to the realm of academia. It dawned on me that journalism might offer an ideal avenue to combine my research on religion with my aspiration to reach a broader audience. In May, I completed the fellowship in global journalism at the Munk School of Global Affairs, where I reported for various media outlets, including the National Post and Vice, on the use of religion in combating \u2013 and occasionally exacerbating \u2013 human trafficking. I covered stories ranging from the unconventional aspects of religion, such as an American internet-based church that evangelizes at porn shows worldwide, to its more inspiring facets, such as a Catholic group successfully assisting thousands of refugees in becoming Canadian citizens. As I currently investigate forced marriage within religious communities in Canada, my conviction in choosing to write about religion for a wide audience has only grown stronger. Modern religions are continually evolving forces that demand attention, particularly as the lines between religion and politics blur worldwide, making journalists critical in ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the entire narrative."}]}

It has been successfully installed on NASA's Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft at Lockheed Martin Space in Colorado, USA. Supported by the UK Space Agency, this cutting-edge camera will accurately map the temperature and composition of the lunar surface at a resolution of approximately 50 meters. By working alongside the spacecraft's high-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3), the LTM will provide valuable insights into the abundance, location, and form of water on the moon. \n\nBoth the LTM and HVM3 instruments have been successfully installed on the Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft, a small satellite measuring only 3.5 meters wide with fully deployed solar panels. The spacecraft's mission is to search for evidence of water on the lunar surface and provide detailed maps to guide future robotic and human explorers, including those participating in the Artemis program's human landings. The discovery of water on the moon holds great potential for various applications, such as purifying it for drinking water or processing it into fuel and breathable oxygen. \n\nThe LTM will utilize four broadband infrared channels to generate temperature maps of the lunar surface, ranging from approximately -163\u00b0C to 127\u00b0C. Additionally, the instrument will employ eleven narrow infrared channels to detect small variations in the composition of silicate minerals that constitute the moon's rocks and soils. This will offer valuable information about the composition of the lunar surface and potential locations of water. \n\nMeanwhile, the HVM3, built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, will detect and map the form, abundance, and locations of water on the lunar landscape by analyzing the wavelengths of reflected sunlight, known as spectral fingerprints. By observing the same locations at different times of the day, the Lunar Trailblazer mission will be able to identify changes in the amount of water present, such as its transformation into a gas as the surface heats up or its accumulation as frost in shadowed regions during surface cooling. This mission aims to answer critical questions such as whether water molecules might be trapped within lunar rock or if the permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles contain substantial quantities of water ice. \n\nLunar Trailblazer was selected by NASA's Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEX) program in 2019, a competition to propose future small satellite missions. The spacecraft will launch as a secondary payload on a planned lunar lander mission led by Intuitive Machines, effectively \"hitchhiking\" on the larger spacecraft. This launch is expected to take place in 2024. \n\nProfessor Neil Bowles, the instrument scientist for LTM at the University of Oxford's Department of Physics, expressed his enthusiasm, stating, \"Designing, building, testing, and now delivering LTM for its journey to the moon is a remarkable feat accomplished by the innovative and dedicated teams at Oxford and across the UK, particularly considering the challenges posed by the recent pandemic. The data gathered from this mission will enhance our understanding of how water is transported across the lunar surface and potentially captured in cold traps near the lunar poles, paving the way for future human and robotic exploration.\"\n\nFor the Planetary Experiments Group at the University of Oxford's Department of Physics, the development of the LTM represents the latest achievement in a 50-year history of creating components for spaceflight and infrared thermal mapping cameras. The department's expertise in this field includes contributions to missions involving Mars, Saturn, and the moon. In 2014, the department successfully built and launched a small infrared thermal camera as part of the UK spacecraft TechDemoSat-1, which aimed to test technologies for creating thermal maps of asteroids. Drawing on this previous experience, the Oxford team was well-positioned to propose an upgraded thermal camera for the Lunar Trailblazer mission."}]}

This is primarily due to the Official Secrets Act, rather than a deliberate neglect. However, a fascinating conclusion that can be drawn from this remarkable biography is that John Langshaw Austin may have played a more significant role in military intelligence during the war than his philosophical contributions in the long run. This viewpoint challenges our understanding of him, despite the overwhelming amount of literature dedicated to Austin as a philosopher, compared to his less documented role as a WW2 intelligence officer.\n\nTo illustrate this point, it is worth examining the situation. Rowe's extensive biography of Austin spans nearly 400 pages before reaching what is traditionally considered the start of his \"main\" career as a philosopher, focusing on his post-war rise in Oxford as a proponent of plain language philosophy. Unfortunately, Austin's life was cut short by lung cancer, and he did not publish much during his lifetime. Nevertheless, he held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel when leaving the army and received honors for his intelligence work, including an OBE, the French Croix de Guerre, and the US Officer of the Legion of Merit.\n\nIn this biography, we not only learn about Austin's already well-known contributions to D-Day intelligence but also his lesser-known but significant role in uncovering Germany's plans in North Africa during a critical juncture of the war. Austin's intelligence work during the Ardennes counter-offensive, orchestrated by Hitler in the winter of 1944-45, was also notable. He was renowned among his colleagues for his sharp intellect and strong work ethic, rather than his ability to socialize. However, it is worth mentioning that he narrowly escaped death while observing the nighttime London Blitz from a rooftop, a popular activity for the wealthy or adventurous at the time.\n\nAside from Austin's war contributions, his association with Oxford University looms large. He attended Balliol College in 1929, and prior to the war, he was a member of Magdalen College as a don. After the war, he held the prestigious position of White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Corpus Christi College (from 1952 onwards). While a comprehensive analysis of Austin's philosophical work is beyond the scope of this review, it is intriguing to note the stark contrast between his kind and generous demeanor in private or supervisory roles with students and his formidable presence in public or combat situations. Throughout this biography, various adjectives beginning with 'A' emerge to describe Austin, such as acid, acerbic, astringent, arrogant, and above all, austere. Other philosophers were so fearful of misusing language that they limited their discourse, which detrimentally affected intellectual debates, philosophy, and perhaps even the university itself. Papers became focused on minor linguistic details, were unambitious, short, and tedious to read. Austin's authoritative stature contributed to this critical atmosphere. Even years later, questions were often phrased in convoluted layers of caution, which persisted not only in philosophy but also in college management matters, which was unfortunate.\n\nOn a lighter note, it is worth mentioning that Austin used to buy a non-alcoholic bottled apple drink called Cidrax for his children, which had an amusing name. This was during the period when he and his wife Jean, an alumna of Somerville College, resided in a large house in Old Marston. Jean outlived John by over half a century, and it was only after her passing in 2016 that the extensive evidence for this biography emerged from cardboard boxes filled with letters and documents. Seven years later, which is relatively short, we now have this book that sheds light on Austin's remarkable life."}]}

With support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), this project aims to address the key challenges currently hindering the tidal energy sector's full potential.\n\nProfessor Richard Willden, the project lead from the University of Oxford's Department of Engineering Science, expressed enthusiasm, stating that the project presents a significant opportunity for the country to harness the powerful tides surrounding it. By utilizing innovative engineering, the project aims to enhance energy security and contribute to achieving the UK's 2050 net-zero goals. Furthermore, the EPSRC investment in COTIDE allows for the collaboration of world-class engineering expertise, ensuring the UK's continued global leadership in tidal stream development and deployment.\n\nTo achieve the UK's target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, it is essential to decarbonize energy supplies and significantly expand renewable energy generation, from the current 50GW to 120-300GW. The UK's powerful tides, which are currently underutilized, present a valuable source of energy. Unlike wind and solar power, tides flow predictably each day, providing renewable and reliable energy that enhances the resilience of energy networks.\n\nCOTIDE will focus on the development of state-of-the-art tidal stream turbine systems. Unlike traditional tidal barrages and lagoons, which require structures such as dams or sea walls, tidal stream turbines can be fixed directly at sea in the path of the strongest and most suitable tidal flows. This approach significantly reduces costs, installation time, and environmental impact. If fully implemented across the UK, tidal stream systems have the potential to generate over 6GW, enough to power more than 5 million homes. Additionally, there is an export market worth \u00a325bn, supporting over 25,000 marine energy jobs.\n\nHowever, technical challenges remain, and careful design is necessary to maximize power generation and ensure reliability in harsh marine environments characterized by corrosive seawater and turbulent waves. To tackle these challenges, COTIDE will bring together three multi-disciplinary teams with expertise in device hydrodynamics, rotor materials, corrosion, risk and reliability, environmental modeling, and system control and optimization. Through a unified co-design approach, the researchers will integrate these areas of expertise into holistic design processes that reduce costs, improve engineering solutions, and eliminate unnecessary redundancy.\n\nProfessor Willden emphasized that COTIDE will develop a framework to assess the impact of design decisions and contribute to fundamental understanding in achieving through-life reliability while maximizing the potential of digitalization for optimal performance.\n\nThe project will also benefit from the University of Oxford's unique capabilities and recent investment in a state-of-the-art current and wave flume, which enables rapid testing of turbine and platform designs. COTIDE will collaborate with over twenty industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies, including EDF Energy PLC, the Health and Safety Executive, the Marine Energy Council, and global manufacturer Arkema International. This collaboration ensures that COTIDE's outputs will provide new tools, models, and processes that directly impact the industry.\n\nSue Barr, Chair of the Marine Energy Council, acknowledged the importance of achieving significant advancements in system performance, reliability metrics, and scalability of tidal stream energy. She believes that the collaborative and innovative nature of the COTIDE project presents a real opportunity for successful outcomes."}]}

which means he ranked third among his peers in obtaining a first-class mathematics degree. After a career in statistics and banking, Blyth found his calling when he joined Harvard University in 2006. In addition to his role at the Harvard Management Company, he thoroughly enjoyed teaching statistics to undergraduates and witnessing the transformative power of universities on their students. Blyth's teaching style included incorporating random, unrelated information into his lectures, a technique he learned during his own undergraduate years in the UK.\n\nPassionate about inclusion, Blyth is dedicated to providing financial support to talented students from low-income backgrounds. He firmly believes in leveling the playing field and ensuring that all students have the opportunity to achieve their educational goals and attend top universities, which have become increasingly expensive, burdening students with significant debts. Blyth admires the US philanthropic culture of giving and its positive impact on education, emphasizing the compound returns and transformative nature of higher education.\n\nBlyth highlights the detrimental effects of student fees introduced in the UK in 1998, particularly on poor and moderate-income students. Although statistical evidence is still emerging, Blyth argues that anecdotally, these fees have significantly hindered access to higher education. Many students opt for paid work instead of incurring debt, while others struggle to balance paying jobs with their studies, limiting their growth as young adults. Blyth questions the structure of student debt, suggesting that it should be structured as a grant instead of a graduate tax that gets forgiven after forty years. He contrasts this approach with Harvard's policy, which ensures that talented students from low-income backgrounds pay nothing, while those who are affluent but talented contribute financially.\n\nBlyth wonders if LMH could expand on its foundation year, created by his predecessor Alan Rusbridger in 2016, to fully fund any qualified applicant who cannot afford to pay. He appreciates LMH's inclusive and progressive nature as a pioneering women's college and values the supportive atmosphere it provides. Although Blyth acknowledges the positive impact of LMH within the collegiate university, he recognizes the limitations imposed by its smaller endowment draw-down, preventing the college from subsidizing student rents as much as desired.\n\nIn summary, Stephen Blyth, a passionate and enthusiastic advocate for inclusion and educational opportunities for all, brings his expertise in statistics and his experience at Harvard to LMH. He envisions a future where LMH can continue to make a significant impact and provide full support to talented students who may otherwise be unable to pursue their dreams."}]}

Elizabeth, at the remarkable age of 98, is believed to be LMH's last surviving alumna from Bletchley Park, according to the college. For a long time, Oxford's involvement in the war effort remained mostly undisclosed due to the Official Secrets Act. In Paul Addison's chapter on the war in the official university history (1994), he downplays the involvement of academics in covert operations, dismissing intellectuals as a minority. He only mentions five names, all of whom are men. However, LMH now knows of 33 women who were recruited, and the college principal at the time, Lynda Grier, was tasked with finding suitable candidates. Elizabeth Kaser was one of them, residing in Lodge Building Room 3 while studying English for a year before being called upon to use her linguistic skills in a role that involved recording and intercepting transmissions. Women were often selected for their proficiency in modern languages and worked alongside cryptographers and other codebreakers at Bletchley Park, which was acquired in 1938 as a war station for the Government Code and Cypher School.\n\nDuring her visit to LMH, Elizabeth had a lively conversation about her experiences with the current college principal, Professor Stephen Blyth. She fondly recalled the vibrant atmosphere in Oxford, which attracted numerous important figures seeking refuge from London's bombing threats. Elizabeth, who attended a convent school in Manchester prior to her time at Oxford, was the first student from her school to attend the university and only the second to attend any university at all. In her recorded oral history interview, she expressed her intention to make her own decisions rather than deliberately break rules, emphasizing her pioneering role. Elizabeth joined LMH at a time when it was uncommon for women to pursue higher education. After just one year of studies, she began work at the Mathematics Institute, where she played a crucial role in decoding war communications for Bletchley Park. Reflecting on that period, she described it as an exhilarating time filled with urgency and intellectual stimulation. The outbreak of World War II presented new opportunities for women, and having signed the Official Secrets Act, Elizabeth worked covertly for the Secret Service, listening to and documenting classified conversations. Following the war, she worked for the World Health Organization in Geneva before eventually returning to Oxford with her young family.\n\nAmong the other Oxford women who served the country in secretive capacities, one of the most accomplished was Patricia Brown (Bartley, 1936). A few years older than Elizabeth at the war's outset, Patricia swiftly rose through the ranks, becoming the head of the prestigious German Diplomatic Section by January 1942. She directed numerous senior men who were older than her. In October of the same year, a breakthrough was made in deciphering \"Floradora,\" a German diplomatic code that was jokingly referred to internally after a musical. While a list of LMH alumnae known to have served during World War II exists, the involvement of other women's colleges such as St. Hugh's, St. Hilda's, Somerville, and St. Anne's is less certain. Certainly, other Oxford alumnae, such as Janet Ferrier (St. Hilda's, 1937), served as well. However, Principal Lynda Grier's role as a recruiter seems to have established Oxford's first women's college as prominent in the recruitment of women for intelligence services during World War II.\n\nBetty Webb, another notable British female codebreaker, recently celebrated her 100th birthday on May 13, 2023, and published her memoir, \"No More Secrets: My Part in Codebreaking at Bletchley Park.\" Betty, like many of her peers, including those at Oxford, expressed a desire to contribute more to the war effort than simply baking sausage rolls."}]}

The findings reveal that the dietary impacts of vegans are approximately one-third of those of high meat eaters. Additionally, there is a 30% difference in environmental harm between high- and low-meat diets across various measures such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, water pollution risk, and biodiversity loss.\n\nParticipants in the study identified themselves as vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, or meat eaters. The researchers assessed the environmental impact of their diets in relation to the aforementioned factors, considering variations in how and where food is produced. By incorporating these variations into their results, the researchers ensure that their findings are based on comprehensive data about the environmental impact of foods, rather than focusing solely on specific production methods that may obscure the relationship between animal-based food consumption and environmental impact.\n\nThe clear relationship between animal-based food consumption and environmental impact should prompt policy actions to reduce meat production and consumption, according to the authors. The study, published in Nature Food, highlights the well-established understanding of the impact of our food choices on the environment. In 2015, the global food system accounted for approximately one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions and was responsible for 70% of freshwater use and 78% of freshwater pollution. Human use, primarily for agriculture, has affected around three quarters of the planet's ice-free land area, resulting in biodiversity loss through activities such as deforestation.\n\nProfessor Peter Scarborough, the lead author from the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at Oxford University, emphasizes the significant impact our dietary choices have on the planet. The researchers' results, which draw on data from over 38,000 farms in over 100 countries, show that diets high in meat have the greatest impact on key environmental indicators, including climate change and biodiversity loss. Reducing meat and dairy consumption can make a substantial difference in reducing one's dietary footprint.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that plant-based diets have lower environmental impacts than meat-based diets in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water use, and that reducing meat intake tends to be healthier. However, these studies have often made assumptions about individuals' food intake and have not considered the variation in environmental impact based on the sourcing and production of food. Professor Scarborough and his team have addressed these limitations by analyzing actual dietary patterns of 55,000 individuals in the UK, utilizing databases that estimate the environmental impacts of commonly consumed foods and incorporating variations in sourcing and production methods.\n\nThe results of the study reveal that all five environmental impacts assessed are associated with the consumption of animal-based foods. Vegans have significantly lower impacts compared to high meat eaters, with their greenhouse gas emissions and land use impacts being only a quarter of those of high meat eaters, water pollution impacts at 27%, water use impacts at 46%, and biodiversity impacts at 34%. Notably, there is at least a 30% difference between low and high meat eaters across most indicators.\n\nThis study builds upon previous research, reinforcing that vegan and vegetarian diets have much lower environmental impacts compared to fish and meat consumption. The regional origin and production methods of food do not obscure the differences between dietary groups and should not hinder policy actions aimed at reducing the consumption of animal-based foods."}]}

Our members have tackled a wide range of topics, such as international relations, theology, genetics, nuclear policy, civil rights, and environmental issues. These discussions have often ignited passionate conversations around the world.\n\nImportantly, our aim has never been to stir controversy for the sake of it. Rather, in recent years, we have faced scrutiny for hosting speakers with differing viewpoints, which some find disagreeable. Former UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan once referred to the Oxford Union as the \"last bastion of free speech,\" a statement that remains pertinent today.\n\nUnfortunately, many moderate thinkers now hesitate to broach certain subjects, fearing backlash from a vocal minority. Social media exacerbates this problem by amplifying extreme reactions. In light of these challenges, we must ask ourselves how we can effectively address the most pressing issues of tomorrow, both domestically and internationally, if we do not encourage today's students to ask difficult questions.\n\nThe chilling effects of self-imposed censorship on university campuses, social media platforms, and the arts show no signs of subsiding. Therefore, defending free speech has never been more crucial. After all, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly upholds the principle of freedom of opinion and expression.\n\nStanding up for this fundamental right poses the greatest challenge for anyone in a position of student leadership. It is disheartening to receive insults, accusations, threats, and harassment from multiple sources, often anonymously, both online and offline. This climate of fear discourages students across the UK from advocating for free speech, as it exposes them to ridicule and mistreatment.\n\nThose who claimed that we \"de-platformed\" speakers last year should consider not only the high-profile nature of our guest speakers and the security challenges they often face but also the resilience required for a student-led organization to extend invitations to controversial figures. As we celebrate our bicentenary, we reflect on notable debates that have resonated globally, the scrutiny our guest speakers have faced, and the contributions of our esteemed alumni.\n\nThis year, we marked the 60th anniversary of granting women equal membership rights, a milestone achieved through decades of advocacy by both men and women. We also commemorated the 90th anniversary of our most renowned debate, 'this house would not fight for king and country,' which even influenced Mussolini's diary and reportedly shaped Hitler's perception of British resolve.\n\nMost notably, we recently held our bicentenary debate, where we welcomed back numerous alumni life members, including Baron Heseltine of Thenford (ex-president, Michaelmas 1954) and Amanda Pritchard (ex-librarian, Hilary 1996). It was a joyous occasion to celebrate the 200-year legacy of free speech at the Oxford Union.\n\nAmidst the festivities, we remain resolute in echoing the university's affirmation that \"free speech is the lifeblood of a university...it enables the pursuit of knowledge...it helps us approach truth.\""}]}

Surprisingly, since February 24, 2022, the determination of Ukrainians to repel the invasion has been met with considerable astonishment worldwide. Yet, would it truly be surprising if Austria were to defend itself against a German invasion? Would anyone express amazement if Canadians volunteered to fight while bombs fell on Toronto? These questions, which have dominated public discourse surrounding Ukraine in the past year, stem from the perception that Ukraine was not considered a legitimate country by either the East or the West. The only difference now, one year after the invasion, is that most countries, with the exception of Russia, now recognize Ukraine as a sovereign nation. Despite this, the Russian president, with an increasing number of troops on Ukrainian soil, still perceives Ukraine as part of a greater Russia and sees Ukrainians as Russians, regardless of their actual identity. This aggression and seizure of territory in Ukraine perpetuate a Russian narrative that asserts their right to a sphere of influence or, more accurately, an empire. This domination of neighboring countries is a relic of Soviet ideology and imperial aspirations, and should be acknowledged as such. Putin's denial of Ukraine's sovereignty and disregard for international law do not bode well for any potential peace process. It is crucial to understand that this perception of Ukraine is deeply ingrained in both the East and the West, even if it is implicit. For many countries, including Ukraine's friendly neighbors, the state's name is preceded by a definite article, \"the Ukraine,\" indicating it as a borderland. The international community has been taken aback by the patriotism and determination of Ukrainians, who achieved independence in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, in the years leading up to and since the USSR's dissolution, Ukraine, like other former Soviet republics, possessed a civil society and a sense of national identity. It is worth noting that nation-building has faced challenges since 1991, as is the case in other former Soviet republics, including Russia. The demise of the status brought by the USSR was a significant blow to Russia, with Putin himself describing it as the worst event of the 20th century. This sentiment is reflected in the fate of Russia's national anthem, which was replaced in 1991 but disliked by the Russian people. When Putin assumed power less than a decade later, he reinstated the Soviet anthem, along with Russia's perception of itself as a powerful entity vis-\u00e0-vis its neighbors. Therefore, although Ukraine has been a sovereign state since 1991, the war it has been engaged in for the past twelve months (and eight years) can be seen as a struggle for independence. While not in the traditional sense, given that Ukraine's statehood is recognized by the international community, it represents the state's assertion of its autonomy, agency, and the ability to determine its own future as a sovereign nation."}]}

However, the origins of this program can be traced back five years earlier, to a memorable Led Zeppelin concert at the O2 Arena in December 2007. Led Zeppelin, a band nurtured by the esteemed Ahmet Ertegun, the Turkish-born founder of Atlantic Records, organized this highly successful concert as a tribute to him following his sudden passing at the end of 2006. Graciously, Led Zeppelin made a significant donation from the concert's profits to create the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund, under the guidance of Mica Ertegun, Ahmet's Romanian-born widow and a successful interior designer in New York. This generous act led to the establishment of a scholarship for a Turkish student to study at Oxford, thereby forging a relationship between Mica Ertegun, the university, and then Vice-Chancellor John Hood.\n\nOver the subsequent five years, Mica Ertegun's commitment to education culminated in the creation of the Ertegun Programme, which provides funding for up to twenty graduate scholarships at a time, specifically in the humanities\u2014a field that Mica and her late husband always ardently supported. The availability of twenty graduate scholarships in the cash-strapped humanities is certainly a cause for celebration. However, the Ertegun Programme goes beyond just financial support for individual scholars, although that aspect is critical for young individuals embarking on this path. Mica Ertegun aimed to establish a community of learning, which led to the funding of the refurbishment of 37a St. Giles', a charming Georgian building now named 'Ertegun House.' Within this elegant establishment, scholars enjoy an array of amenities, including spacious desks, a stylish seminar room for academic events, a kitchen-common room for informal interaction, and a tasteful courtyard and garden. Moreover, there are two staff members on the ground floor readily available to offer comprehensive support to students, including a senior academic from the university serving as the 'senior scholar in residence' and a full-time administrator ensuring the smooth operation of the institution and addressing any arising issues. Additionally, the program allocates a budget for various events, such as group visits to exhibitions or funding one-day workshops on a scholar's specialized subject.\n\nNow, a decade later, can we confidently assert that the Ertegun Programme has achieved its objectives? I am well-positioned to assess this inquiry, having served as the first 'senior scholar' in Ertegun House for four years and maintaining a close involvement with the program since then. I can wholeheartedly affirm that it has been an immense success. The program's accomplishments are undeniably impressive, having supported or currently supporting 141 scholars from all continents, pursuing degrees ranging from the MSt to the DPhil in various humanities disciplines, encompassing formal logic to egyptology. Furthermore, Ertegun House has undeniably fostered a vibrant scholarly community, providing invaluable peer support and encouragement in research, which can often be a solitary endeavor. It has successfully dismantled the barriers of hyper-specialization that plague modern academic life, nurturing ambition and interdisciplinary thinking. A pinnacle of the scholars' week is the Wednesday lunchtime seminar, where each individual presents their research to their colleagues, fostering stimulating discussions and inquiries.\n\nHaving had the privilege of working as the senior scholar at Ertegun House, I can attest to the enriching experience of engaging with bright minds from around the world in an environment perfectly suited for research and debate. My four years at Ertegun House profoundly contributed to my intellectual growth and provided a positive atmosphere for personal development. I can confidently assert that the same holds true for all who participate in the program."}]}

These occurrences serve as clear evidence of the decline in ecosystems worldwide, ranging from coral reefs to forests in Australia and the Amazon, as well as peatlands and the arctic tundra. We are currently experiencing immense pressure on the natural world, which is crucial for both the climate and our future.\n\nIt is important to recognize that threats to climate and biodiversity are not separate issues to be tackled independently. They are inherently interconnected. Today, two briefings have been published by the Royal Society and the InterAcademy Partnership, which consists of science, engineering, and medical academies from around the world, representing countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, and from the USA to China. These briefings were prepared by leading scientists and approved by various national academies, providing a collective perspective from the UK and the global scientific community.\n\nThe briefings emphasize the central role of biodiversity in climate change discussions. Biodiversity and climate change are inseparable. The timing of these briefings is not coincidental, as biodiversity is currently the focus of the UN conference COP15, and will also be a key theme at COP26 in Glasgow in less than a month. Leaders and policymakers from around the world will convene in Scotland to discuss climate change, and nature will be at the forefront of these discussions. However, we argue that nature should not only be present but should also underpin decision-making processes.\n\nOur report, published by the Royal Society, urges world leaders to ensure integrated climate and biodiversity policies. Only by doing so can we effectively protect biodiversity while simultaneously contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The briefing provides details on how climate change impacts biodiversity and ecosystems, creating a cyclical effect where rising temperatures lead to fires, droughts, and floods, resulting in further ecosystem degradation and exacerbating climate change.\n\nDespite the alarming news, there is hope. Both climate change and the natural world can be supported, and biodiversity can be encouraged. By integrating climate and biodiversity policies, we can unlock the full potential of biodiversity to support climate action. Nature-based solutions are already available, but they require significant investment to be implemented on the necessary scale. Immediate actions can be taken, such as restoring peatlands, improving forests, promoting sustainable farming, reducing meat and dairy consumption, and increasing protected land and sea areas. However, it is important to recognize the hazards associated with certain interventions aimed at mitigating climate change, such as planting trees in natural grasslands or savannas, or expanding bioenergy, as these can further harm biodiversity and put additional pressure on our lands. Moreover, these nature-based solutions must be implemented alongside substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and cannot serve as substitutes or excuses for delaying action on emissions. Additionally, the cooperation and engagement of local communities are essential to ensure fair outcomes.\n\nIn the coming months, we have a unique opportunity to address the climate change and biodiversity crises in an ambitious and holistic manner. We must seize this chance to make a meaningful impact."}]}

These issues were already prevalent before the pandemic, but now they have worsened significantly. It is crucial that we expand our perspectives and plan ahead to prevent future setbacks.\n\nIn order to illustrate the interconnectedness of these problems, let's consider the Pakistani mango. It is a vibrant and beloved fruit that thrives in our scorching summers. Unlike the mangoes found in British supermarkets, Pakistani mangoes are diverse, with over 1,500 varieties, 30 of which are commercially grown. They play a significant role in our summer culture, adorning produce stalls and enlivening food markets. Eating a Pakistani mango is not merely a task, but a surrender to its deliciousness.\n\nUnfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a threat to the mango industry and other fruits and vegetables. Mangoes have a short shelf life, and time is running out to harvest and ship this year's crop. Normally, Pakistan exports around two million tons of mangoes annually to over 50 countries, but this year it may not be possible due to COVID-related challenges. Conflicting policies have restricted laborers' movement, transporters' operations, and food prices have dropped, all of which pose risks to the harvest and food producers. Pakistan, like many other countries, faces severe food insecurity due to the pandemic.\n\nMoreover, the crisis of climate change has already inflicted significant damage on fruit crops and the livelihoods of ordinary citizens. Extreme weather events, shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns, and pests have all taken a toll. As a result, at least half of the country's households face some form of food security stress, and almost 40% of children under the age of five are stunted. The situation is dire for millions of vulnerable people and is projected to worsen.\n\nOne might wonder why these issues should matter to those outside the region. To answer this question, we must explore pathways for change. Prime Minister Imran Khan's leadership in Pakistan has already implemented an exceptional measure to address the crisis. Through the 10 billion tree tsunami project, the unemployed are earning money by participating in a reforestation initiative that began in 2014. This project aims to alleviate the hardships caused by COVID-19 while also addressing climate change. Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change, and the fruit and vegetable sector, which supports millions of people, is particularly at risk.\n\nEfforts to combat poverty are also underway through the Ehsaas poverty alleviation program, which has provided emergency cash assistance to over 12 million affected families during the lockdown. The barriers to financial inclusion and empowerment are also being addressed through improvements in mobile and internet banking. However, it is vital to continue developing the necessary institutional and policy support to ensure that these programs can serve as long-term safety nets for the most vulnerable in our population.\n\nWhile the current situation may seem bleak, there is ample room for innovation and optimism. We should not only envision the end of the world as we know it but also make space for imagination. Let us imagine the joy and happiness of biting into a wonderfully succulent mango, despite the messiness it may bring. Humans have shown resilience in the face of adversity, and we will overcome this crisis to embrace a new normal. But it is crucial to ensure that we do not leave behind a large segment of the population in our efforts."}]}

However, electric cars are not yet at the desired level of performance and are not a complete solution to environmental issues. Additionally, major cities continue to face the problem of congestion.\n\nThe Oxford EV Summit, hosted by the business school for the second year, focused on these topics. \"EV\" stands for electric vehicle. Unlike the previous year, this discussion delved into unexpected areas and provided more nuanced and cautious insights. One recurring theme, commonly discussed at such conferences, was the obstacles electric vehicles face in terms of cost, performance, and infrastructure. Despite these challenges, electric vehicles are nearly here and should be embraced.\n\nAn example of progress is the upcoming production of the electric Mini in Oxford's industrial suburb, Cowley. Although it costs around \u00a38,000 more than the petrol model, has a range of 124 miles (compared to the conventional 400 miles for petrol and even more for diesel), and cannot be charged at most garages, it demonstrates the progress being made.\n\nDuring the conference, Paul McNamara, Technical Director for Williams Advanced Engineering, highlighted the missed opportunity for electric vehicles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He argued that if electric applications had been just slightly more efficient, electric cars could have gained popularity instead of internal combustion engine vehicles. However, gasoline-powered vehicles, spearheaded by Henry Ford in 1908, prevailed. McNamara also mentioned that in the 1930s, people joyfully burned electric trams in San Francisco, heralding the victory of privately-owned, internal combustion engine cars. Looking back now, it is evident that the internal combustion engine solution was far from optimal in terms of propulsive efficiency.\n\nElectric motors are approximately 85% efficient, with 85% of the energy consumed being converted into forward motion. In contrast, internal combustion engines are only 25-30% efficient, wasting a significant amount of energy as heat and harmful emissions. The success of the car industry has resulted in its downfall. The inefficiency and pollution were not apparent when there were fewer cars on the road. However, with over 34 million vehicles in the UK today compared to half that number in the past, pollution and congestion have become major issues, particularly in Oxford.\n\nGlobally, there are currently over 1 billion vehicles, and this number is expected to triple by 2050, with the majority of them still relying on internal combustion engines and liquid fuels. This reality is disheartening for climate activists, air quality regulators, and electric vehicle advocates alike. However, there is hope as some countries are transitioning to decarbonized power grids, making electrification an increasingly viable and logical solution over time.\n\nThe main challenge for electric vehicles lies not in energy efficiency but in energy storage. Conventional cars benefit from the high energy density provided by liquid fuel tanks, which is a significant advantage compared to the bulkier and heavier batteries used in electric vehicles."}]}

I began to suffer from intense headaches, a burning sensation in my face, dizziness, brain fog, palpitations, and extreme exhaustion. This occurred in September 2008, around the same time that Wi-Fi and cordless landline phones were installed in the building where I worked at Paris University.\n\nAfter conducting some research online, I discovered that many others were experiencing similar symptoms. Interestingly, when I was in an environment with limited wireless connectivity, my symptoms would subside. Considering the impending introduction of smart meters, 5G, and the Internet of Things, the public is set to face even more exposure to anthropogenic radio-frequency radiation (RFR) used in wireless technologies.\n\nScientists from various countries have expressed growing concerns about the health and environmental consequences of RFR exposure. In 2015, over 200 specialists in the effects of electromagnetic fields on biological systems signed an appeal to the United Nations and the World Health Organization, urging for more protective exposure limits and public advisories to reduce RFR exposure.\n\nWhile the prevailing public health view is that exposure to RFR at non-thermal levels, which do not cause tissue heating, is safe, the appeal to the UN argues otherwise. It highlights that published studies have indicated adverse effects at levels below current international guidelines, such as increased cancer risk, cellular stress, heightened levels of harmful free radicals and genetic damage, changes in the reproductive system, cognitive and memory impairments, neurological disorders, and general well-being issues. One prevalent impact of RFR appears to be disrupted sleep, a problem that is gaining significant attention. Though there are multiple causes of sleeplessness, several studies have linked RFR exposure to the inhibition of melatonin production, a hormone essential for restorative sleep and a potent antioxidant. The combination of blue light emitted by screens and ambient RFR levels may be contributing to the current epidemic of sleeplessness.\n\nThe substantial and continuously growing body of evidence on the biological effects of non-thermal RFR exposure has motivated me and countless others worldwide to raise awareness about the potential long-term health risks associated with wireless radiation, particularly among children and young people. Shedding light on corporate interference in RFR research, a comprehensive investigative article titled \"How Big Wireless Made Us Believe Cell Phones Are Safe: A Special Investigation\" was published by The Nation on March 29, 2018. I would challenge anyone to remain unconcerned after reading this article.\n\nSince 2005, the UK Chief Medical Officers have recommended that children and young people under the age of 16 should only use mobile phones when necessary and keep their calls brief. Unfortunately, this advice has not been widely disseminated, and many parents are unaware of it, resulting in a significant number of children regularly using smartphones. Government data reveals that half of UK children aged 9 to 16 use a smartphone daily, in addition to being exposed to RFR throughout the school day via Wi-Fi.\n\nGiven that our economy is increasingly reliant on RFR, based on the flawed scientific belief that anthropogenic RFR is harmless unless it causes tissue heating, it is likely to be unsustainable in the long run. Therefore, in addition to practicing more restraint in our current wireless usage, we should explore the development of alternative technologies that are compatible with our biology, ensuring long-term sustainability. Just as we are striving for a low-carbon economy, we should aim for a sustainable, low-RFR economy. With visionary thinking and ambition, the University of Oxford, or some of its innovative alumni, could take the lead today in pioneering safe and bio-friendly technologies of tomorrow. As an alumnus, I would be proud to see my alma mater rise to this challenge."}]}

The study, led by Dr. Gregori Galofr\u00e9-Vil\u00e0 from the Department of Sociology at the University of Oxford, utilized data from archaeological excavations across England to calculate the average height of men throughout history. The researchers determined the individuals' heights by analyzing the length of their femurs.\n\nThe study found that the average height of men in this region increased during the Roman occupation (200-410 AD), from 167cm (5ft 6in) to 170cm (5ft 7in). The researchers attribute this rise in height to the Romans' improved water supply, sanitation systems, and diverse diet. After the Romans left Britain in 410, heights did not immediately decline but began to fall from 600 AD. The paper suggests that the abandonment of the Romans' hygienic water supplies and waste-disposal systems may have contributed to deteriorating health, leading to an increase in infectious diseases and inadequate diets.\n\nHowever, in the wake of the Black Death in 1348-1350, average heights increased again, coinciding with a boost in agricultural production. From 1400 to the early 1650s, mean height reached 173-174cm (5ft 8\u00bdin), similar to the heights observed in the 20th century. The early 1600s were particularly healthy, potentially due to the introduction of poor laws that contributed to better health among the poorer sections of society. Heights declined after 1650, reaching a low of 169cm (5ft 6\u00bdin) in the late 1600s, continuing until the early 1800s.\n\nComparisons with previous studies conducted by Richard Steckel of Ohio State University reveal consistent findings across Europe. However, the Oxford-led study suggests that the English may have fared better during the Little Ice Age, a period of cooling following the Medieval Warm Period, with the health effects being more pronounced in continental Europe.\n\nLooking towards the future, the study notes a significant increase in average heights for Englishmen since the early 19th century, reaching 175cm in 1950 and 177cm (5ft 10in) in 1970, among the tallest populations worldwide. This unprecedented growth in average heights within the last century suggests a new era in terms of wellbeing. It is clear that the average heights of Englishmen have experienced a remarkable surge, surpassing any previous recorded history."}]}

These individuals, escaping conflict and autocratic regimes in nations such as Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Ukraine, have a recognized international right to find sanctuary. Welcoming refugees is not only a human rights obligation but also offers substantial benefits to the countries that receive them.\n\nAt our Refugee Studies Centre, extensive research demonstrates that refugees bring valuable skills, talents, and aspirations to the communities that host them. Building upon Oxford University's rich history, we have a longstanding tradition of welcoming refugees, dating back to our support for refugee academics during World War II and extending to our recent assistance to students and scholars affected by the conflict in Ukraine. The \"Ark of Civilization: Refugee Scholars and Oxford University, 1930-45\" documents the remarkable contributions refugees have made to our community.\n\nEnriching our community, we warmly embrace students with displacement backgrounds. In the current cohort of our MSc in Refugee and Forced Migration Studies, 10 out of 29 students have personally experienced displacement. The diverse perspectives they bring from around the world greatly enhance the teaching and learning experience for both students and faculty.\n\nStriving to foster a welcoming environment, Oxford is actively creating a community of sanctuary for sanctuary seekers, including students, staff, and members of the local community. Mansfield and Somerville Colleges were recently awarded the College of Sanctuary status for establishing sanctuary scholarships that offer fully funded places for postgraduate study. Furthermore, the university and colleges have increased the number of full scholarships available to graduate students with displacement backgrounds. This academic year, we rapidly responded to the crisis in Ukraine by establishing the Ukraine Graduate Scholars Programme. Additionally, we have piloted the Refugee Academic Futures Scholarship Programmes, which combine the university's refugee scholarships with a cohort support program and network for all students across Oxford who identify as having a displacement background.\n\nLooking ahead to the next academic year, we expect to welcome a similar number of students with displacement backgrounds, thanks to the support of new scholarship funding, including the Mastercard Foundation AFOX Scholarships, XTX Markets' support for the Ukraine Programme, and the Hope Scholarships in collaboration with the Weidenfeld Hoffmann Trust. In 2023-4, our pan-university cohort program will relaunch as the \"Oxford Sanctuary Community,\" and we aim to attract even more internal and external funding for graduate and undergraduate scholarships for sanctuary scholars from every part of the world.\n\nFurthermore, Oxford has applied to attain the status of a University of Sanctuary, a designation held by 24 universities throughout the country. To achieve this, we must fulfill a series of minimum criteria and endorse the City of Sanctuary Charter. We eagerly await the decision on our sanctuary status, which we hope will be confirmed soon. The application process has brought together colleagues from across the university, colleges, and the city.\n\nTo encourage engagement, we are hosting the Oxford Sanctuary Fair in collaboration with the local NGO, Asylum Welcome, on May 11th at the Town Hall. This event will bring together refugees, students, and the local community for panel discussions, workshops, and stalls. Its aim is to raise awareness and foster connections between civil society organizations in Oxford and students, staff, and the community. The fair will run from 10:30 am to 6:30 pm, and all are welcome to attend. We encourage you to join us in supporting this important cause."}]}

In a conversation forty years ago, at the age of 87, Rebecca shared memories that encompassed significant events of the 20th century, which still carry resonance today. These events included experiences with tsarist pogroms, command performances in imperial Germany, a perilous passage across borders during World War I, concerts in freezing halls for Red Army soldiers during the Russian Revolution, and more. Rebecca, a child prodigy, had a father who played the bassoon under the direction of Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov. Recognizing the potential of talent to break free from the restrictions of the Jewish Pale of Settlement under the tsars, her parents sent all four of their young children to the world's top conservatories to refine their skills. In 1924, Rebecca, who possessed great charm, left Europe's concert halls to perform and teach in the rudimentary mandate Palestine. In 1965, she was hailed by Ha'aretz as a \"living legend\" to her students, both past and present, who have become musicians and educators around the globe. Her invaluable contributions to classical music in Israel were recognized in 1985 when she received the keys to the city of Tel Aviv.\n\nJean's career has encompassed various roles in teaching, writing, consulting, entrepreneurship, and the non-profit sector. She and Mike met at the University of Pennsylvania and later married at Oxford. Mike, on the other hand, is an environmental lawyer, solar energy developer, and writer. In 2021, they jointly published \"A Border Town in Poland: A 20th Century Memoir\" through Penn Convoy Press. In this book, Alexander Ross, a current research student in Oxford's Faculty of History, explores how creative entrepreneurs saved Hollywood studios in the 1970s by establishing the calculated blockbuster as the dominant business model. Ross highlights the contributions of visionary individuals like Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas, and Zemeckis in creating the modern blockbuster business model (BBM). However, with the emergence of streaming giants such as Netflix and the ensuing competition faced by studios, consumers now have the convenience of deciding what to watch from the comfort of their homes. This shift renders the distinction between \"cinema\" and \"television\" outdated, presenting opportunities for innovative filmmakers who prioritize their artistic vision over box office revenues. Ross offers a fresh analysis of the future possibilities for the calculated blockbuster and whether streamers will eventually take control by generating their own content. Students and scholars in film studies, screenwriting, and popular culture will find this book particularly intriguing.\n\nThe author, who matriculated from New College in 2008, has a fascinating background having worked in Oxford prior to his studies. He explains, \"I arrived in Oxford in early 1996 as a researcher in human viral genetics and quickly became immersed in the early days of the internet. Abandoning my plans for an academic career, I taught myself programming and shifted my professional trajectory. Following the dot-com crash, I unexpectedly found myself developing spam filters just as spam was becoming a major issue. During this work, we discovered nation-state cyber attacks that were being blocked by our filters. As I delved deeper into these issues, I realized there were no textbooks available to educate the public on threat intelligence techniques. The notion of civilians working in the private sector to conduct threat intelligence was still relatively new. After many years in this field, I have compiled the textbook that I wish I had when I first embarked on this journey.\""}]}

Ogletree Jr., affectionately known as \"Tree,\" has left behind a remarkable legacy. He was not only a beloved professor at Harvard, but also an early advocate for slavery reparations and a champion for gender equality. Ogletree was renowned for his work as a legendary public defender, a civil rights scholar, and a lawyer for indigent clients.\n\nOne of his notable achievements was serving as the lead counsel for Anita Hill during her testimony against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, where she accused him of sexual harassment. Ogletree was also a mentor to many aspiring African American lawyers, including Michelle Robinson Obama '88 and Barack Obama '91.\n\nOgletree taught at Harvard Law School for over three decades, from 1984 until his retirement in 2020 due to an early onset of Alzheimer's disease. During his tenure, he established the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice and the Criminal Justice Institute at Harvard Law School. He also ran an informal \"Saturday school\" where he provided guidance to law students.\n\nIn light of his passing last Friday at the age of 70, tributes have poured in from across the nation. Colleagues and friends in the Harvard community have reflected on his impact and how they will remember him. Ogletree's legacy encompasses his professional achievements as a renowned criminal defense lawyer, a passionate advocate for racial justice, and a visionary founder of two influential institutes at Harvard Law School.\n\nHowever, his legacy extends beyond professional accomplishments. Ogletree was deeply committed to fostering and nurturing a sense of community. He selflessly shared his intellect, energy, and empathetic personality to uplift others. He had a genuine belief in everyone's potential and dedicated himself to helping them thrive. His commitment to black Harvard students, many of whom faced significant disadvantages, was particularly profound. Ogletree mentored them through his \"Saturday school\" and fostered leadership skills among student athletes through the Breakfast Club, which he co-founded with Coach Amaker and Ron Sullivan.\n\nAs a pathbreaking member of the Harvard Law School faculty, Ogletree welcomed and supported all who followed in his footsteps. He made a point of gathering and connecting with black faculty members, fostering a sense of camaraderie over shared meals. His warm welcome and infectious smile left a lasting impression on those he encountered.\n\nIt is only fitting that an endowed chair at Harvard Law School now bears his name, honoring his significant contributions. Ogletree's legacy serves as a reminder for all of us to strive for professional success while prioritizing service and maintaining humility. His impact on others is perhaps his greatest accomplishment. We are all indebted to him and have a responsibility to pay it forward by inspiring and creating opportunities for others.\n\nPersonally, I feel incredibly fortunate and blessed to have had the opportunity to forge a friendship with Harvard Law Professor Charles Ogletree. He played a pivotal role in my life and, like many others, helped me grow and exceed my own expectations. His commitment to selfless service has inspired me to carry on his legacy by bringing inspiration and opportunity to others. Among his many achievements, this will undoubtedly be his greatest legacy \u2013 the positive influence he had on countless lives. We all owe him a debt of gratitude."}]}

The Gazette interviewed several faculty members from various artistic disciplines, including writing, film animation, architecture, music, and mixed-media art, to gather their perspectives on whether AI should be seen as a threat, a collaborator, or a tool to enhance their own creativity and imagination. The interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nDuring my recent experience judging a story contest, reading the shortlisted entries shed light on the challenges AI might face in creating good writing versus exceptional writing. The most outstanding human-written stories surprised me with their unique perspectives on the world, linguistic originality, and authentic and distinctive details derived from personal experience. While AI can imitate and learn quickly, and may even produce strong works in established styles or experiment with language if prompted, I believe it will lack true insight and personal experience. Commercial genres with easily recognizable styles and tropes are particularly vulnerable. Even autofiction, with its introspective first-person narrators, can be easily mimicked, but what will be absent, I suspect, is the genuine vision that comes from living in a specific physical environment.\n\nIn terms of music performance, artificial intelligence does not concern me. Music has the ability to convey and represent emotions, something AI cannot do at present. This is especially true in jazz and creative music where the composition happens in the moment as musicians collaborate on stage. That sense of interplay and the ability to react spontaneously are aspects that AI cannot replicate because they require intelligence, curiosity, and a musical vocabulary. Only then can one truly respond and create music in the moment.\n\nRegarding composition, AI has been composing music for film and television for several years now. This is worrisome because AI is taking over tasks that were traditionally performed by musicians. However, when you listen to compositions created by AI, they lack surprise, emotion, and even silence. Personally, I appreciate dramatic elements in music, and emotion plays a crucial role for me. AI has not yet reached that level.\n\nAs for how music reaches people, we have witnessed tremendous changes. Platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, iTunes, and others utilize algorithm-based features to provide music recommendations based on individual listening habits. We are aware that AI powers these recommendations. Musicians would like to see algorithms suggest lesser-known composers rather than those who are already popular. The new technology should democratize the field, ensuring access to non-mainstream music and fostering appreciation for musical traditions beyond the Western world. It is important to embrace AI and explore its potential to enhance our understanding and work creatively with it.\n\nIt is natural for any new technology to initially be viewed as a threat to the established order, similar to how radio was initially received. Opposition to such innovations has always existed. However, we must remember that these advancements are products of human ingenuity and creativity. As musicians, we should open ourselves to embrace the knowledge and innovation that AI can bring, using it to our advantage."}]}

Trump have announced their candidacies for the White House in the 2024 election. However, recent polls indicate that many Americans believe Biden, at 80 years old, and Trump, who turned 77 in June, should not run again due to their advanced age. Concerns about Biden's mental sharpness and physical health, as well as the perception that Trump has an advantage, are supported by another recent survey. While age-related concerns have some validity in general, experts caution against drawing conclusions based on insignificant or unreliable indicators. With the current median age in the U.S. Senate at 65 and nearly 58 in the House, the issue of age in leadership positions is becoming more significant as people live longer and remain in office. Age has historically been seen as a flaw, as seen with Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, but the fixation on age for both Democratic and Republican front runners is a newer development. Considering that Biden and Trump are two of the oldest individuals to hold the office, many voters view age as a legitimate factor to consider. The concern about age may also reflect worries about illness and the possibility of a president dying while in office. Notably, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders faced little age criticism when he ran for president at 75 in 2016 and 79 in 2020, suggesting that concerns about age may be a desire for energetic leadership and new ideas. On the right, attacking Biden's physical and intellectual fitness has been a consistent political strategy since the 2020 primaries. Republican candidate Nikki Haley, 51, has even questioned whether Biden would live long enough to complete a second term and proposed mental competency tests for politicians over 75. Age and health have been less of a weakness for Trump compared to Biden, as voters have other concerns about him that overshadow his age. While corporate America often requires senior executives to retire in their mid-60s or early 70s, the Constitution has no age limit for presidents, leaving voters to apply their own standards to judge a candidate's fitness for office. However, assessing someone's mental or physical fitness based on brief observations is highly unreliable. Cognitive acuity and name retrieval become more complex with age, but executive function and real-world performance are more important metrics. In a recent TV interview, Biden emphasized his \"wisdom\" and \"experience\" as reasons to re-elect him, considering he will be 82 on inauguration day. Age and physical health greatly influence cognitive performance, a factor that is often overlooked."}]}

This forecast aligns with the current trends in developed countries, where concerns about climate change have prompted efforts to electrify transportation, promote renewable energy sources, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, experts from Harvard caution that the energy needs of less affluent nations, which are eager to develop their economies, may challenge these expectations for years to come.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in the 1970s, has predicted that the demand for oil in transportation will reach its peak in 2026 due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, growth in biofuels, and improvements in fuel efficiency. The IEA also anticipates a slowdown in demand growth across all sectors, from 2.4 million barrels per day this year to just 0.4 million barrels per day by 2028, with a potential overall peak by 2030.\n\nHenry Lee, the Jassim M. Jaidah Family Director of the Harvard Kennedy School's Environmental and Natural Resource Program, and a senior lecturer in public policy, believes that achieving the peak of oil use for transportation by 2026 is a realistic possibility, given the current circumstances. Even if that timeline proves to be overly optimistic, he believes it will be achieved by the early 2030s. Lee acknowledges the surprising speed at which parts of the world are transitioning towards electric vehicle adoption. For example, China, the largest auto market globally, has witnessed a 26% increase in electric vehicle sales in the first five months of 2023. Chinese EV manufacturer BYD Auto has experienced a 92% sales growth this year. In the United States, companies like Ford and GM have heavily invested in electric vehicle design and manufacturing, with plans to release new models between 2025 and 2027. Volkswagen also has plans to introduce new electric vehicles in 2026 and 2027, aiming for the majority of its fleet to be electric in the near future.\n\nLee highlights that Ford and GM, driven by California regulations, have invested billions of dollars in electric vehicle development, making it too late to change course. However, despite this momentum, there are still significant obstacles to overcome for a smooth transition. Challenges related to electricity pricing and the establishment of charging infrastructure remain unresolved. Currently, the cost of charging vehicles is artificially low, which is acceptable given the limited market share of electric cars. However, this situation will need to be addressed as electric vehicles become more prevalent on the roads, and the solution is yet to be determined. Furthermore, substantial investment is still required to ensure an adequate number of charging stations, transmission lines, smart transformers, and energy storage facilities. While some funding has been approved through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, private investment that is several times more significant is still needed. Automakers have recognized this need, and in June, Ford and GM announced an agreement to adopt Tesla's charging technology platform, enabling their vehicles to use Tesla's nationwide charging network.\n\nWhile industrialized nations are utilizing regulations and market forces to facilitate the transition away from fossil fuels, experts point out that the developing world presents an unpredictable element in the IEA's forecast. While oil consumption for electricity generation is relatively low worldwide, this is not the case in some developing nations, where gasoline and diesel generators are used to supplement small or unreliable power grids, and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) is employed for cooking, transportation, and heating. For instance, a 2014 World Bank study estimated that Nigeria's electricity demand was between 8,000 and 10,000 megawatts, but only 3,500 megawatts were provided by the national grid. The shortfall was primarily compensated for by gasoline and diesel generators.\n\nOverall, the future of oil consumption depends on a variety of factors, with the developing world representing a potential obstacle to the IEA's predictions for the decline in demand. While progress is being made in developed countries, challenges such as electricity pricing, charging infrastructure, and investment still need to be addressed to ensure a smooth and successful transition."}]}

Even seemingly mundane activities like cooking dinner can have profound health implications. The World Health Organization reported that indoor air pollution, largely caused by cooking fires, resulted in an estimated 3.2 million deaths globally in 2020. Lassiter argues that rich countries have the luxury of making choices, while poor countries are driven by necessity. Their objective is to provide their citizens with reliable energy around the clock, supporting economic development and well-being. This is why fossil-fuel power plants and refineries will continue to be constructed, and coal, gasoline, LPG, and diesel will remain as fuels. Lassiter predicts that it will be many years, if not decades, before there is a peak in global oil demand. He believes that the global south will continue to consume every barrel produced worldwide. Nuclear power remains an option for affordable, dependable, and carbon-free energy, particularly in the developing world. Regulatory obstacles have hindered nuclear plant expansion in industrialized countries, but Chinese and Korean designs offer cost-effective alternatives. Transitioning to electric vehicles in the developing world will face challenges due to weaker home power infrastructure, making it difficult for consumers to charge their cars. Additionally, many developing countries, lacking domestic automakers, will increasingly rely on imports from manufacturers focused on electric models. However, the rise of renewables in developing nations does not necessarily impede the global shift towards sustainable energy. Fast-growing countries like China, India, Southeast Asia, and Africa will play crucial roles in shaping the energy landscape in the coming decades. These regions are also fostering innovation in alternative energy, paving the way for large-scale implementation. Oil companies, despite facing impending peak demand, are unlikely to disappear. Some will maintain a focus on fossil fuels, confident in their ability to compete in a shrinking market. However, mid-level oil producers without sufficient financial resources to weather the transition or invest in alternatives will face the greatest challenges. Nevertheless, certain companies are committed to remaining relevant in the evolving energy sector and should not be overlooked in the move towards greener sources. Recent research conducted by Cohen indicates that these companies are actively involved in developing and patenting green technologies. They are often pioneers in various green sectors, producing high-quality innovations that serve as foundations for other alternative energy innovators."}]}

Molina argues that standardized solutions from developed cities like Los Angeles and London cannot be relied upon due to varying local conditions. Molina cites examples of pollution reduction efforts in Mexico City and Beijing to support his case for new knowledge and fresh policy solutions in combating the dense and unhealthy smog plaguing urban areas.\n\nMolina highlights that while steps to reduce sulfur dioxide in Beijing have been effective in lowering pollutant levels, they have not succeeded in improving air quality. Laboratory studies have revealed that nitrogen oxides and ammonia, in addition to sulfur dioxide, act as precursor chemicals in a complex chain of reactions that contribute to smog formation. Similarly, government attempts to curb air pollution in Mexico City, which often obscures mountain views, have been ineffective as they fail to fully consider local cultures and customs. A ban on driving cars on high-pollution days resulted in individuals purchasing second vehicles, often older and more polluting, to commute to work.\n\nAs a distinguished professor at the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography and co-winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chlorofluorocarbons and atmospheric ozone, Molina's expertise is widely recognized. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland's 1974 paper in Nature shed light on the threat to ozone in the stratosphere, which shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. This led to national regulations and the ratification of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 by 197 countries, effectively phasing out the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons. Recent observations suggest that the Antarctic ozone hole is starting to close, while the Montreal Protocol is hailed as a successful international agreement to combat global environmental threats.\n\nDuring his speech at Harvard University's Science Center, Molina emphasized the need for improved public transportation as a means to reduce automobile pollution. Encouraging individuals to choose alternative modes of transportation is challenging due to limited viable options. Molina stressed the importance of further research in both scientific and policy aspects to address these issues. He believes that solutions found in Mexico City could benefit developing cities in China and vice versa, emphasizing the need for collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\nMolina expressed concern over the United States' apparent inclination towards increasing carbon dioxide emissions, rather than making the necessary cuts to avoid dangerous global temperature increases. He warned that estimates of a 4 to 5-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures by 2100 carry enough uncertainty to suggest a one-in-five chance of it exceeding 7 degrees Celsius (12 degrees Fahrenheit). Such a drastic increase could lead to catastrophic changes that future generations would have to tackle.\n\nOverall, Molina's call for new studies, fresh policy solutions, and increased research underscores the importance of addressing air pollution in megacities to protect human health and the environment."}]}

vastly influence the process . the first , published in nature materials , showed that contrary to the way the process was long believed to happen , catalysts are capable of restructuring their surfaces during reactions , and then returning to their normal state . catalysts have been a fundamental part of modern industrial processes for more than a century , but the development of new catalysts to speed up chemical processes has remained inconsistent . to more fully understand precisely how the catalysts work , and to aid in the development of new catalytic materials , cynthia friend , director of imasc , the theodore william richards professor of chemistry and professor of materials science , and colleagues from the lawrence berkley ( lbnl ) , brookhaven ( bnl ) , and lawrence livermore ( llnl ) national laboratories set out to observe the process of catalysis as it happens . cutting-edge scientific tools yielded images of the atoms in the material and monitored how the composition of the catalyst surface changes . microscopy facilities at the center for functional nanomaterials at brookhaven and the advanced light source at berkeley were essential for these experiments . two additional studies \u2014 one described in nature communications and the other in the journal of the american chemical society ( jacs ) \u2014 detail a second discovery , that previously ignored molecular forces have a significant effect on how compounds react during catalysis . taken together , the discoveries represent an entirely new understanding of how catalysis takes place , and offer a possible roadmap for the design and development of a new generation of energy-efficient catalysts for a host of industrial processes . conducted in collaboration with colleagues at several national laboratories and other partnering institutions , researchers at the doe-funded imasc are combining tightly controlled experimental conditions and computational tools to develop new methods for developing catalysts and new ways to understand the process of catalysis . \u201cthis is really a paradigm shift in catalyst discovery , \u201d friend said . \u201cfor 100 years or more , this was a trial-and-error process . in recent years , people are striving for a more systematic approach . our center , through synergistic collaboration between the investigators from the partnering

about before in catalysis . \u201d the first of those principles , he said , is the notion that catalysts are able to dynamically rearrange the atoms on their surface to drive certain reactions . friend and colleagues found that while catalysis may occur under a range of conditions , at certain temperatures and pressures , catalysts are able to dynamically rearrange the atoms on their surface to drive certain reactions , and then return to their normal state . \u201cthis is a critical discovery in catalysis , because so far , the mindset has been to simply design a catalyst\u2019s surface

Mesoscale Architectures for Sustainable Catalysis (IMASC) at Harvard have made groundbreaking discoveries about the process of catalysis. Contrary to previous beliefs, the researchers have shown that catalysis is a more dynamic process, with molecular forces having a significant influence. These findings have important implications for the development of new catalysts to improve chemical processes.\n\nLed by Cynthia Friend, Director of IMASC and a professor of Chemistry and Materials Science, the research team collaborated with national laboratories such as Lawrence Berkley, Brookhaven, and Lawrence Livermore to observe catalysis in action. Cutting-edge scientific tools were used to capture images of atoms in the material and monitor changes in the catalyst surface. The microscopy facilities at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven and the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley were crucial for these experiments.\n\nThe team's two additional studies, published in Nature Communications and the Journal of the American Chemical Society, reveal the significant impact of previously overlooked molecular forces on catalytic reactions. These discoveries mark a new understanding of the catalysis process and offer a potential roadmap for designing energy-efficient catalysts for various industrial processes.\n\nThe research conducted at IMASC, funded by the Department of Energy, involves a combination of controlled experiments and computational tools to develop new methods for catalyst development and enhance our understanding of catalysis. This collaborative effort with national laboratories and partnering institutions is revolutionizing the trial-and-error approach to catalyst discovery.\n\nAccording to Challa S.S.R. Kumar, the program's managing director, approximately one-third of the world's energy is dedicated to the chemical industry. Therefore, improving the efficiency of these processes by accelerating reactions or operating at lower temperatures can have a significant environmental impact. Kumar emphasizes the development of a new catalyst discovery paradigm, which includes innovative design principles previously unexplored in catalysis.\n\nOne such principle is the dynamic rearrangement of catalyst surface atoms to drive specific reactions. Friend and her colleagues discovered that catalysts can undergo this rearrangement and then return to their normal state. This finding challenges the traditional mindset of solely designing a catalyst's surface and highlights the need to consider its dynamic nature during the design process.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers found evidence that tiny molecular forces, known as van der Waals forces, play a critical role in influencing the reactivity and selectivity of different molecules during catalysis. This discovery sheds light on why closely related compounds may exhibit different reactions.\n\nThese novel insights into catalysis represent a paradigm shift in the field. While the team has demonstrated these design principles in one case, their ultimate goal is to develop widely applicable catalysts and methods for catalyst design. They aim to revolutionize a variety of catalytic reactions.\n\nOverall, the research conducted at IMASC is revolutionizing our understanding of catalysis and offering new avenues for the development of energy-efficient catalysts. With their systematic approach and collaboration with renowned institutions, they are paving the way for transformative advancements in the chemical industry."}]}

Chan School of Public Health's Center for Health and the Global Environment and SUNY Upstate Medical has found that the design, maintenance, and operation of buildings can have a significant impact on our overall well-being. The study, the first of its kind, focused on high-performing, green-certified buildings and their effects on employee decision-making and cognitive function.\n\nThe researchers examined 10 high-performing buildings in five cities across the United States, including Harvard's Double LEED Platinum Blackstone South Building. Working in collaboration with the Office for Sustainability and Harvard Real Estate, they used the Blackstone building as a \"living laboratory\" to study the relationship between building conditions and occupants' productivity and well-being.\n\nThe findings of the study were impressive. Occupants in high-performing, green-certified office environments scored 26 percent higher on cognitive function tests, experienced 30 percent fewer symptoms of sick building syndrome, and had 6 percent higher sleep quality scores compared to those in high-performing but noncertified buildings. The study also identified specific factors that influenced participants' cognitive function scores, such as environments within the thermal comfort zone defined by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), which resulted in higher cognitive function scores. Additionally, brighter, blue-enriched lighting, such as daylighting, was associated with better sleep quality and improved cognitive performance.\n\nThe researchers behind the study are passionate about merging building science with health science and advocating for what they call \"buildingomics.\" This approach examines all factors in the building-related environment that influence human health, well-being, and productivity. Their goal is to improve the health of people in all buildings everywhere, every day. As part of this effort, they have developed \"The 9 Foundations of a Healthy Building,\" which is a concise synthesis of 30 years of scientific data on the key elements that make buildings healthy.\n\nThis study builds on the team's previous research, which found that cognitive function scores doubled in simulated green building environments with enhanced ventilation compared to conventional buildings. The current study demonstrates that even in buildings with high ventilation rates and low chemical concentration, green certification and factors like lighting and thermal conditions can further improve the work and health of occupants.\n\nIn related research, the Center for Health and the Global Environment recently received a grant to study and quantify the health impacts of biophilic design, which involves integrating nature into the built environment. The team plans to use this grant to fund a mobile virtual reality lab to simulate exposure to indoor environments and monitor student and staff participants in both the lab and Harvard buildings with varying levels of natural elements.\n\nThis research aligns with Harvard's \"living lab\" initiative, which encourages projects that use the campus to develop solutions for enhancing well-being and mitigating climate impact. The Office for Sustainability and the Center for Health and the Global Environment are engaged in a multiyear partnership to use campus spaces for public health research and practical application.\n\nOverall, this study highlights the importance of creating healthy buildings and demonstrates the positive impact they can have on employees' well-being and productivity. It emphasizes the need for a holistic approach that considers factors like building design, maintenance, lighting, and thermal conditions to create environments that promote better health and performance."}]}

Chan School of Public Health recently hosted a forum titled \"Hormone-Altering Chemicals: Fertility and Health Implications.\" Co-presented with The Huffington Post and moderated by Senior Living Editor Erin Schumaker, the panel discussed the effects of chemicals on the endocrine system and their impact on fertility and childbirth. The panel began by highlighting the prevalence of toxic chemicals in our everyday environment. Common products such as personal hygiene items, medications, food packaging, and even window blinds contain over 10,000 chemicals that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It is worth noting that many of these chemicals are banned in China and the European Union.\n\nRuss Hauser, the Acting Chair of the Department of Environmental Health at the Harvard Chan School, explained that these chemicals are endocrine disruptors, meaning they can interfere with metabolism, the immune system, and fertility in both men and women. While our exposure may be at low levels, there is evidence to suggest that even these small amounts can affect humans. Tamarra James-Todd, a professor of environmental reproductive and perinatal epidemiology at the Harvard Chan School, emphasized that certain populations, such as pregnant women and minorities, are particularly vulnerable. Chemicals found in cosmetics and industrial products have been linked to glucose disruption, which can lead to type II diabetes that can be passed from pregnant women to their children. Another at-risk group is teenage women, as they tend to use more cosmetics and personal products than adult women. Testing for 25 chemicals in teenage girls revealed that 16 were present and associated with endocrine disruption. This is concerning as adolescence is a critical period for brain and immune system development.\n\nPete Myers, CEO and Chief Scientist of Environmental Health Sciences, spoke via Skype from Europe and focused on the challenges of effective regulation. He stressed that endocrine-disrupting chemicals are recognized as a global health threat by the World Health Organization, yet they are not regulated as such in the United States. The slow progress in regulation is largely due to financial reasons, as the removal of multiple products from the market would be costly and lead to legal battles. Myers highlighted the need for a more efficient system that translates scientific findings into regulation.\n\nConsumer power does exist, however. The Environmental Working Group maintains a database of products that are rated for chemical safety. Additionally, the recent expansion of the Toxic Substances Control Act provides more regulatory power to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, the future of this act is uncertain under the new presidency. All panelists agreed that stronger government regulation is necessary, but they expressed doubts about its immediate implementation.\n\nIn the end, all panelists concurred that what is most needed is a comprehensive set of policies that would make shopping for safe products easier for parents, so that they do not need to be well-versed in chemical engineering."}]}

This perception has been reinforced by decades of research characterizing psychopathy as a profound inability to process emotions like empathy, remorse, or regret. However, a recent study challenges this notion by suggesting that psychopaths are not incapable of feeling regret and disappointment. Instead, their difficulty lies in accurately predicting the outcomes of their choices.\n\nCo-authored by Joshua Buckholtz, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard, and Arielle Baskin-Sommers, an assistant professor of psychology and psychiatry at Yale University, the study presents a new model of psychopathy that sheds light on the decision-making process of psychopaths. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study challenges the assumption that psychopaths make bad choices because they cannot generate negative emotions or respond appropriately to emotional cues from others.\n\nBy employing an economic game, Buckholtz and Baskin-Sommers demonstrated that psychopaths exhibit normal or even heightened emotional responses in situations that typically elicit regret. However, they struggle to extract information from the environment that would indicate whether their actions will result in regret. This inability to utilize signals of prospective regret hampers their decision-making process.\n\nBuckholtz explains that regret consists of two components: retrospective regret, which refers to the emotional experience after learning that a different choice could have led to a better outcome, and prospective regret, which involves using signals from the environment to predict which actions will or won't lead to regret. The study reveals that psychopaths struggle specifically with the latter, as they cannot use information about their choices to anticipate the level of regret they might experience and adjust their decision-making accordingly. This \"blindness to future regret\" prevents them from effectively using such information to guide their decisions.\n\nBaskin-Sommers emphasizes that these findings highlight a more nuanced dysfunction among psychopathic individuals. They are not simply incapable of regret or other emotions, but rather face obstacles that hinder their adaptive functioning. Understanding this complexity can lead to the development of more accurate methods for predicting the costly behavior exhibited by psychopathic individuals.\n\nFurthermore, the study demonstrates that by measuring prospective regret sensitivity, Buckholtz and Baskin-Sommers were able to predict the likelihood and frequency of participants' incarceration. Contrary to expectations based on traditional emotional-deficit models, participants' emotional responses to regret did not predict their incarceration. This suggests that intact behavioral regret sensitivity could serve as a protective factor against incarceration in psychopathic individuals. \n\nWhile the study challenges the prevailing pop-culture image of psychopaths, Buckholtz hopes that it will also provide new insights into how psychopaths make decisions. He notes that our understanding of their decision-making process is limited, as existing research has primarily focused on their emotions and emotional experiences. Gaining a deeper understanding of why psychopaths make poor choices will be crucial for future research in the field of psychopathy."}]}

currently running a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that incorporates adaptive learning and assessment algorithms. This innovative feature tailors the course material to each student's performance, something that has not been offered in previous HarvardX courses. While a few courses on the edX online learning platform also utilize adaptive learning functionality, it is particularly highlighted in the course \"Super-Earths and Life,\" taught by Harvard's Phillips Professor of Astronomy, Dimitar Sasselov.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to assess the feasibility and implications of incorporating adaptive functionality into online course design. Adaptive learning programs have proven effective in accelerating information acquisition, enhancing retention, and personalizing learning to address areas where learners struggle. According to Peter K. Bol, Harvard's Vice Provost for Advances in Learning and Charles H. Carswell Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, \"adaptive functionality allows users to optimize learning based on their performance, offering a personalized path to mastery.\"\n\nRobert A. Lue, HarvardX Faculty Director and Professor of the Practice of Molecular and Cellular Biology, emphasizes the advantage of digital content in providing real-time feedback, which can be faster than feedback from a classroom instructor. Adaptive functionality goes beyond simple multiple-choice questions; it identifies a student's strengths and adjusts the material accordingly. This tailored experience aims to ensure that students benefit from the online learning experience.\n\nTo implement the adaptive learning algorithm, VPal researchers and HarvardX technologists collaborated with educational technology company Tutorgen. The algorithm was integrated into a subset of the \"Super-Earths and Life\" content, with users divided into experimental and control groups. The control group received a predetermined set of non-adaptive problems, while the experimental group received assessments with problems presented sequentially based on prior performance.\n\nPreliminary results indicate that the adaptive algorithm effectively fosters efficient learning in the course. VPal research analyzed course data and observed differences in learner efficiency and performance between the adaptive experimental group and the control group. On average, the adaptive group progressed faster through the course materials, spent less time on task, showed more persistence in course assessments, and attempted fewer problems overall. Overall, the experimental group achieved a 19 percent larger knowledge gain compared to the control group.\n\nBased on these promising results, VPal research and HarvardX plan to expand the use of adaptive learning functionality in future HarvardX courses and explore how this technology can further improve online learning outcomes."}]}

Created by visual artist Christina Seely in collaboration with the Canary Project, this unique exhibit showcases the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), including specimens of threatened, endangered, and extinct species.\n\nYou'll be enthralled as you explore the darkened room and witness the gradual fading of iconic animals such as the jaguar, monkey, antelope, grizzly bear, wild dog, and Siberian tiger. These captivating visuals serve as a poignant reminder of the fragile state of our planet's biodiversity. Furthermore, the exhibit offers a glimpse into the past with specimens from extinct species like the heath hen, great auk, and New Zealand's flightless moa.\n\nThanks to the generous support of Clark Bernard and Susana Bernard, this thought-provoking exhibit runs until June 4. It marks a departure for the Harvard Museum of Natural History, which typically showcases scientific perspectives. Jane Pickering, Executive Director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, expressed her enthusiasm for this experimental exhibit during a recent reception, stating that it has been a resounding success.\n\nThe alarming increase in species extinctions and reductions in biodiversity over the past two centuries cannot be ignored. While it remains to be seen whether this human-driven crisis will rival past global mass extinctions, the trends are undeniably concerning. According to MCZ Director James Hanken, the rate at which species are being lost today is significantly higher than in previous centuries. Without intervention, our world, and even the United States, will be vastly different in just 150 years.\n\nThe Harvard Museum of Natural History's mission extends beyond academia. Educating the public and policymakers on urgent scientific issues is a crucial part of their mandate. By incorporating an artist's perspective, the museum can effectively appeal to a wider audience. Hanken explains that artists appeal to our emotions and consciousness in a way that charts and graphs cannot.\n\nChristina Seely's interest in extinction was sparked during her arctic photography expedition. Following a conversation with Jane Pickering, she collaborated with MCZ faculty-curators to select specimens for this exhibit. As you wander through the exhibit, you'll encounter display cases meticulously lit in the darkness. These showcases feature remarkable artifacts, such as the brown boxes filled with great auk bones and a single heath hen egg nestled in a bed of white cotton.\n\nOne of the exhibit's highlights is a series of striking photographs of endangered or threatened animals. These images, arranged along two walls, gradually fade from view, mirroring the uncertain future of these creatures. Additionally, you'll find intriguing items like the ear of a sei whale, a narwhal tusk, and the moa, providing a glimpse into the diversity of MCZ's collections.\n\nThrough the artist's lens, \"Next of Kin: Seeing Extinction Through the Artist's Lens\" aims to deepen public connection and awareness of critical scientific issues.

This breakthrough, led by Thomas D. Cabot Professor Isaac Silvera and postdoctoral fellow Ranga Dias, has significant implications for our understanding of matter and could have a wide range of applications, including as a room-temperature superconductor. Their research, outlined in a paper published in Science, marks a major achievement in the field of high-pressure physics.\n\nSilvera describes the creation of metallic hydrogen as the \"holy grail\" of high-pressure physics, as it is the first-ever sample of its kind on Earth. At extreme pressures of 495 gigapascal, or over 71.7 million pounds per square inch, solid molecular hydrogen breaks down into atomic hydrogen, transforming into a metal. While this work provides insights into the properties of hydrogen, it also indicates the possibility of revolutionary new materials.\n\nOne important prediction is that metallic hydrogen is meta-stable, meaning it will remain metallic even when the pressure is relieved. Similar to diamonds formed under intense heat and pressure, metallic hydrogen could retain its properties without external pressure. This stability is crucial because metallic hydrogen has the potential to act as a superconductor at room temperature.\n\nThe development of a room temperature superconductor could have transformative effects on various industries. It could enable magnetic levitation of high-speed trains, enhance the efficiency of electric cars, improve the performance of electronic devices, and revolutionize energy production and storage. Superconducting coils, with their zero resistance, could store excess energy for later use.\n\nFurthermore, metallic hydrogen could play a pivotal role in space exploration, serving as a more powerful rocket propellant. The energy required to create metallic hydrogen could be released when it is converted back into molecular hydrogen, making it the most potent rocket propellant known. This could significantly advance rocketry, allowing for easier exploration of the outer planets and the launch of larger payloads.\n\nTo achieve this breakthrough, Silvera and Dias utilized synthetic diamond, one of the hardest materials on Earth. By carefully polishing and treating the diamond, they made it even more resilient. The diamond anvil cell device was used to create the intense pressure required for the transformation of hydrogen into its metallic form.\n\nAfter more than four decades of research and nearly a century since its conception, the successful creation of metallic hydrogen brought immense excitement to Silvera and his team. This accomplishment opens up new possibilities in the field of high-pressure physics and has the potential to revolutionize various industries and space exploration."}]}

However, a recent conference held at Harvard aimed to change this narrative and take a step towards a more inclusive future.\n\nThe Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics brought together 250 physics majors for lab tours, lectures, personal stories, and practical discussions about research, graduate school applications, combating discrimination and implicit bias, and finding mentors. The conference, organized by Anne Hebert, a Harvard graduate student, aimed to connect participants with a support network that will help them navigate and progress within the field.\n\nHebert acknowledges that as an undergraduate, she noticed the lack of female representation in physics and believes that every woman in the field has had a moment where they realize they are the only woman in the room. Another organizer, Ellen Klein, a Harvard doctoral student, shares that she never experienced overt gender discrimination in her time at Yale University. However, she has observed a decline in female representation as she has advanced academically. Delilah Gates, also part of the organizing committee and a Harvard doctoral student, agrees that bias, although subtle, remains a problem. All three organizers acknowledge that progress has been made, but there is still work to be done, as they have heard male classmates make jokes about women, highlighting the need for continued efforts.\n\nGates, as a black woman, faced additional pressure in college to prove that her opportunities were not solely based on her race, which left her momentarily conflicted about applying to graduate school.

However, the development of effective catalysts to expedite chemical processes has been a hit-or-miss endeavor, causing frustration. To tackle this challenge, a team of Harvard researchers, in collaboration with national laboratories and partnering institutions, is taking a fresh approach. The researchers at the Department of Energy-funded Energy Frontier Research Center's Integrated Mesoscale Architectures for Sustainable Catalysis (IMASC) are combining carefully controlled experiments with computational tools to discover new catalyst development methods and gain a better understanding of catalysis processes.\n\nUnder the leadership of Cynthia Friend, the Theodore William Richards Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Materials Science, and Director of the Rowland Institute, IMASC researchers have made significant breakthroughs in comprehending the mechanisms of catalysis. These findings hold promise for designing and developing more energy-efficient catalysts. The results of their work are detailed in a nature materials paper published on December 19.\n\n\"This discovery marks a paradigm shift in catalyst research,\" remarked Challa S. S. R. Kumar, the program's managing director. \"Traditionally, catalyst discovery has relied on trial and error for more than a century. However, in recent years, scientists have sought a more systematic approach. Through synergistic collaboration among investigators from partnering institutions, our center has established new principles for understanding catalytic reactions under controlled conditions, using computational modeling. These principles are then applied to develop catalysts that perform optimally in real-world scenarios.\"\n\nBuilding on these principles, researchers are currently investigating the potential of nanoporous silver-gold alloys as enhanced catalysts. \"These catalyst materials are designed based on our model systems,\" explained Kumar.\n\nTo aid in the development of catalytic materials, Friend and her colleagues from Lawrence Berkeley, Brookhaven, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories embarked on studying the catalysis process in real-time. Utilizing cutting-edge scientific tools, they captured images of the atoms in the material and observed how the catalyst surface composition changed. Microscopy facilities at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven and the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley played a crucial role in these experiments.\n\nKumar emphasized the significance of studying how catalyst materials dynamically change before, during, and after catalysis: \"This critical information has not been considered in catalyst design. With this paper, we demonstrate that we now possess the tools to investigate these dynamic changes, which can be correlated with the catalyst's activity and selectivity.\"\n\nDeveloping new catalysts is not only aimed at improving industrial chemical processes. Kumar highlighted that approximately one-third of the world's energy is dedicated to the chemical industry. Therefore, enhancing the efficiency of these processes, be it through faster reactions or lower operating temperatures, could have a substantial environmental impact. \"Many of these chemical processes, some of which are over a century old, have a significant carbon footprint,\" explained Kumar. \"Reducing the energy requirements for these processes could have a tremendous effect on energy consumption, significantly altering their carbon footprint. And now, we possess the tools to achieve this goal.\""}]}

Andrew Guess, an assistant professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs, was given the opportunity to study the effects of two influential social media platforms on the 2020 election using de-identified primary data. Guess eagerly accepted, believing that conducting experiments on the platforms themselves is crucial for understanding the impact of feature changes and interventions on user behavior in the realm of social media and politics. He has been actively involved in efforts to facilitate data-sharing between researchers and platforms, making him a valuable addition to the project team. Together with his 16 academic collaborators and researchers from Meta (the parent company of Facebook and Instagram), Guess set out to investigate how changes in the delivery of content on these platforms impacted users. The team recently published three papers in Science and one in Nature. It is worth noting that Meta agreed to the team's proposed research questions and study designs, with the understanding that they could only reject them for legal, privacy, or feasibility reasons. Meta had no authority to restrict or censor the findings, and the academic lead authors had final say over writing and research decisions. Guess explained that comprehensive evidence of the impacts of social media on user experiences and behaviors has been scarce due to the limited accessibility of relevant data within the platforms themselves. In one of the papers, titled \"How do social media feed algorithms affect attitudes and behavior in an election campaign?,\" Guess and his co-authors examined the effects of Facebook and Instagram feed algorithms on 23,000 consenting Facebook users and 21,000 consenting Instagram users from October to December 2020. The team assigned a sample of users to reverse chronologically ordered feeds, where the newest content appeared at the top, while the control group's feeds were governed by the platforms' default algorithms. They discovered that moving users out of algorithmic feeds significantly reduced the time they spent on the platforms and their activities. This change also affected the type of content users encountered, with an increase in political and untrustworthy content on both platforms, a decrease in uncivil and hateful content on Facebook, and a rise in content from moderate friends and ideologically mixed audiences on Facebook. However, despite these changes, users who received chronologically based content did not report significant shifts in their levels of issue polarization, affective polarization, political knowledge, or other key attitudes throughout the study. Guess's other paper in Science, titled \"Reshares on social media amplify political news but do not detectably affect beliefs or opinions,\" explored the effects of exposure to reshared content during the 2020 election. A random subset of 23,000 Facebook users were assigned feeds that contained no reshared content over the three months of the study. The researchers found that removing reshares significantly reduced the amount of political news users were exposed to, including content from untrustworthy sources, leading to a decrease in overall clicks and reactions and a reduction in partisan news clicks. Similar to the first study, the team did not observe any changes in political polarization or individual-level political attitudes among the subset of users who did not see any reshared content. However, these users did display notable decreases in accurate news knowledge. Guess emphasized that this implies that reshares actually increase people's knowledge, which may seem counterintuitive since reshared content is often associated with misinformation. However, the team found that more reshared content comes from trustworthy sources than untrustworthy ones, resulting in a net increase in people's overall information. The team has published the first set of papers in Science and Nature, with at least 10 more papers planned for publication in the future. Additionally, they are providing access to de-identified data from the studies to other academic researchers who are interested in exploring their own research questions."}]}

However, new research suggests that consuming partisan news also leads to a decline in trust in the media. In a study conducted during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, internet users were asked to change their default browser homepages to either the left-leaning Huffington Post or the conservative Fox News. Over an eight-week period, participants' trust in the media decreased, a trend that continued even after nearly a year for visitors to both partisan news sites. While exposure to partisan news did result in a temporary increase in website visits and improved knowledge of current events, it did not lead to changes in political attitudes, opinions, or behaviors.\n\nAccording to Andy Guess, an assistant professor of politics and public affairs at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and co-author of the study, previous research has shown links between exposure to partisan news and polarization, but the underlying cause has been debated. This study adds a piece to the puzzle by demonstrating that it is difficult for people to be persuaded by competing media outlets during an election campaign. However, spending more time on these partisan news sites does contribute to a growing distrust in the news.\n\nThe study, conducted by Guess along with Pablo Barber\u00e1 of the University of Southern California, Simon Munzert of the Hertie School, and Junghwan Yang of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, partnered with the online polling firm YouGov. They initially recruited 1,551 respondents from YouGov's \"Pulse\" panel, which included users who had previously installed passive metering software on their devices to collect detailed data about their online behaviors. Participants agreed to participate in a \"politics and media\" study consisting of multiple survey waves and could withdraw at any time.\n\nIn the study, participants were asked about the news they consumed, their attitudes on domestic and foreign policy issues, voting behavior and preferences, and their approval of President Donald Trump. In the third survey wave, the researchers implemented a \"nudge-like\" approach where one-third of the group was asked to change their browser homepage to the Huffington Post, another third to Fox News, and the remaining third served as the control group with no changes. The choice of Fox News and Huffington Post was based on their significance in the current political landscape and empirical web tracking data on news consumption.\n\nThe researchers found that participants in the Huffington Post group visited approximately one additional page on the website each day, totaling nearly 50 seconds of additional browsing time. The Fox News group visited nearly four more pages per day, equivalent to an additional two minutes. Prior to the study, participants spent an average of only 34 minutes per week on any news site.\n\nThe findings of this study emphasize the power of subtle changes in digital settings, such as browser homepages, in shaping people's information consumption. By promoting authoritative and nonpartisan sources of information, social platforms and other intermediaries can play a role in combating the downward spiral of distrust. This research was funded by a grant from the Volkswagen Foundation Computational Social Science Initiative and received additional support from the Princeton University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Center for International Studies at the University of Southern California."}]}

James Madison had hoped that the constitutional system would prevent the polarization caused by political parties, as it can undermine the functioning of government. Unfortunately, polarization and a subsequent loss of diversity in societal positions are evident today, both in the United States and globally.\n\nThe papers in this issue offer a systems perspective on the forces driving polarization and its consequences. The hope is that understanding these forces will contribute to better governance.

Once users are in these bubbles, they miss out on various news articles, including those from their preferred media outlets.\n\nGuess stated, \"It is not difficult to find evidence of polarized discourse on social media, but we have limited knowledge about the mechanisms that contribute to social media driving people apart. Our contribution is demonstrating that polarization of online social networks occurs naturally as people curate their feeds. Surprisingly, this can even occur without knowledge of other users' partisan identities.\"\n\nWhile it is widely recognized that Americans are not as polarized as the politicians they elect, a study led by Princeton's Edwin S. Wilsey Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Naomi Ehrich Leonard, and Queens College Associate Professor of Political Science, Keena Lipsitz, along with Princeton doctoral student Anastasia Bizyaeva, reveals that Americans are partially responsible for the extremism of their elected officials. The researchers found that over time, conservative swings in public opinion, which are typically slightly larger and more prolonged than liberal swings, exacerbate the self-reinforcement processes for Republican lawmakers. This means that legislators respond to favorable public opinion by further strengthening their own positions. The study identified a tipping point where the process of polarization accelerates due to compounding driving forces and overwhelming mitigating forces. Republicans are believed to have passed this critical threshold, while Democrats are rapidly approaching it.\n\nLeonard explained, \"By combining our expertise on political processes with our understanding of feedback and nonlinearity in complex time-varying processes, we have made new discoveries about the mechanisms that can explain and potentially alleviate political polarization. Until now, the changes in public opinion over time had not been linked to the political polarization of lawmakers. However, by considering the nonlinearity in how lawmakers respond to public opinion, we demonstrate that these differences are significant, and even small swings in public opinion can lead to significant changes in polarization. I am optimistic that the analytical tools we developed for this study will be useful in finding ways to slow down this trend.\"\n\nA paper co-authored by Princeton's Susan Dod Brown Professor of Politics and Public Affairs, Nolan McCarty, and University of Pennsylvania Professor of Natural Sciences, Joshua Plotkin, along with Alexander J. Stewart, Senior Lecturer in Mathematical Biology at the University of St. Andrews, explores how intergroup conflict triggered by economic hardship can decrease social and economic interactions, thereby intensifying economic decline and political polarization. The findings suggest that implementing progressive taxation to ensure a sufficient social safety net could help prevent the economic anxieties that fuel ethnic and racial conflict.\n\nMcCarty stated, \"Over the past two decades, the United States and many other countries have undergone significant economic, social, and political changes, including economic crises, escalating inequality, exacerbated racial and ethnic conflicts, and deepening political polarization. Our paper aims to understand the intricate dynamics that connect these developments and explore methods to break this negative cycle.\""}]}

The study was co-authored by Simon Levin, Princeton's James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor in ecology and evolutionary biology, and Yphtach Lelkes, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers were inspired by James Madison's essay, \"Federalist No. 10,\" which argued that a republic can mitigate the dangers of factions by promoting a diversity of political interests. However, despite Americans caring about a wider range of political issues now compared to 75 years ago, polarization has worsened.\n\nThe researchers developed a theoretical model of cultural evolution to investigate the role of partisan interactions in this puzzle. Their analysis confirmed Madison's belief that societal cohesion increases when individuals care about a greater diversity of issues. However, under extreme partisanship, individuals become less open to learning from peers with different political ideologies. This leads to increased tribalism, diminished interest diversity, and heightened polarization. However, the researchers also found a positive aspect: the harmful effects of extreme partisanship are significant only when individuals rely primarily on social peers to shape their opinions and strategies, rather than independently exploring different perspectives.\n\nTarnita emphasized the importance of actively seeking out diverse perspectives beyond one's social network in order to maintain a cohesive society. Kawakatsu highlighted the need to study polarization in a multi-level context that considers the dynamics of cooperation and independent exploration, as the interactions between partisanship, cooperation, and independent exploration can have unexpected outcomes.\n\nIn a separate analysis led by Sam Wang, a professor of neuroscience and director of the Electoral Innovation Lab at Princeton, it was proposed that dynamic systems theory, commonly used in engineering and biology, can provide insights into democracy reforms such as ranked-choice voting and citizen redistricting. Wang and a team of political scientists argued that this systems-based approach can help understand the complex interactions that contribute to weaknesses in American democracy, including polarized institutions, unresponsive representatives, and minority factions gaining power over the majority.\n\nThe use of concepts like nonlinearities, amplification, positive and negative feedback, and integration over time can aid in identifying problems in representation and institutional power. Furthermore, a mathematically rich description of how electoral mechanisms interact can enhance the effectiveness of proposed reforms within the context of individual states' politics and procedures.\n\nWang emphasized the objective of translating the American political system into a mathematical complex-systems framework to engage scholars from the natural sciences. The aim is to encourage natural scientists to develop models that accurately reproduce political phenomena, create simulations to explore alternative scenarios, and design interventions that can improve the functioning of democracy. This approach aligns with the goals of engineers, who seek to understand systems well enough to make repairs or improvements."}]}

Led by Matt Sosna, a data scientist at Aquicore and a Ph.D. graduate in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton, the study focused on how golden shiners, a type of small schooling fish, respond to perceived threats.\n\nGolden shiners are known for their ability to evade predators by exhibiting \"startle cascades,\" a behavior similar to an avalanche or a wave. The behavior begins with one or more fish initiating a fast and sudden burst of swimming in response to a perceived threat, and then spreads through the entire school of fish, much like a wave moving through a crowd at a soccer game.\n\nThe researchers found that the likelihood of a startle cascade occurring depends on how closely the fish are packed together. When the fish bunch up closely in response to a threat, a startle cascade is more likely to happen. This is because when a startle occurs, the proximity of the fish to one another increases the chances of it propagating throughout the entire school.\n\nUnderstanding how animals make decisions in risky or dangerous situations is crucial for their survival. Factors such as avoiding predators and other threats play a significant role in an organism's reproductive success, along with mating and food acquisition. Scientists have extensively studied how individual animals respond to such situations, examining the complex interplay between sensory inputs, previous experiences, and physiological states.\n\nOverall, this study sheds light on the fascinating phenomenon of animal group behavior and the mechanisms behind collective computation.

Marshall, an internationally renowned artist who had recently joined the Princeton faculty, was in the audience and reached out to Leonard afterwards with the idea of combining their interests and exploring flocking concepts with dancers.\n\nThis collaboration aligned well with the Princeton Atelier, an academic program that supports professional artists who come to campus for collaborative work with students and faculty. Leonard and Marshall's aim was to create a class that would bring together dancers and students and culminate in cross-disciplinary performances.\n\nThe performances, which took place in December, were held in the Icahn Laboratory atrium and the Rockefeller College common room. They showcased the basic rules of flocking, which rely on cohesion and repulsion to keep animals together in a group without colliding. By introducing dance and performance into Leonard's scientific theories, Marshall sought to explore how these flocking rules could be artistically applied and learn more about how people sense and respond to others in a group.\n\nTo shape the class and performances, sophomore Willa Chen collaborated with Leonard and Marshall to create an online simulation program. This program allowed Chen to program flocking rules that inspired choreographic movement, such as maintaining distance between dancers and avoiding obstacles.\n\nWhile performances based on principles found in animal flocking are not uncommon in dance, the \"Flock Logic\" performances stood out as they appeared choreographed even though the dancers were simply following the rules of flocking observed in nature. The atelier course and dance rehearsals attracted a diverse group of participants, including students, professional dancers, and volunteers from across campus who received training beforehand.\n\nOverall, the professors aimed to create an engaging event that would bring together the community in the collaborative exercise of flocking, allowing participants to experience movement as both science and art."}]}

Ressa, the CEO and executive editor of the Philippines-based online news organization Rappler.com, shares the award with Dmitry Muratov, the founder and editor-in-chief of the Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta.\n\nThis prestigious achievement for Ressa follows an exceptional week for Princeton, with senior meteorologist Syukuro \"Suki\" Manabe receiving the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics on October 5, and David Macmillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry, being honored with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on October 6.\n\nWith over 30 years of experience as a journalist in Asia, Ressa co-founded Rappler.com in 2012, which has since become one of the leading online news organizations in the Philippines. Prior to this, she served as CNN's bureau chief in Manila and Jakarta. Ressa's reporting on the authoritarian administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has subjected her and Rappler to repeated intimidation tactics by the Philippine government, aiming to discredit their work. In 2020, Ressa was convicted of \"cyber libel\" along with a former Rappler reporter, a conviction she is currently appealing.\n\nThe Nobel committee acknowledged Ressa's use of freedom of expression to shed light on abuse of power, violence, and growing authoritarianism in the Philippines. As a journalist and the CEO of Rappler, Ressa has fearlessly defended freedom of expression, directing critical attention to the controversial and deadly anti-drug campaign of the Duterte regime. She has also documented the manipulative use of social media to spread fake news, harass opponents, and manipulate public discourse.\n\nIn an interview with Rappler, Ressa emphasized the importance of fighting for facts, particularly in a world where misinformation and hate-filled lies spread more rapidly and extensively than truth. She stated that journalism has transformed into activism, and journalists face the challenge of upholding the mission of journalism.\n\nJoe Stephens, the founding director of Princeton's program in journalism, expressed his admiration for Ressa's extraordinary courage and the impact she has made in exposing corruption and injustice. He praised her for inspiring and empowering other brave journalists worldwide, emphasizing that Ressa embodies Princeton's commitment to serving the nation and humanity.\n\nMarissa Michaels, a member of the class of 2022, attended Ressa's talk at Princeton in 2019 and a dinner with her for journalism students. Michaels described Ressa as an inspiration, both as a journalist and as a global citizen. She highlighted the importance of international news coverage in safeguarding journalists and shedding light on the situations in the Philippines, including the drug war, the information war, and the attacks on Rappler.\n\nOverall, Maria Ressa's Nobel Peace Prize win is a momentous occasion for her, journalism, and democracy on a global scale. Her unwavering dedication and bravery in exposing truth and advocating for freedom of expression deserve immense recognition and celebration."}]}

This innovative technology allows for the identification of proteins' closest neighbors on cell surfaces. When approached by corporate partners involved in the Princeton Catalysis Initiative, David Macmillan and his team were presented with a challenge related to potential cancer medicines and other therapeutics. The partners wanted to understand which proteins on a cell's surface interact with each other, and sought a metaphorical \"searchlight\" to shed light on these protein-to-protein communications.\n\nProteins, as complex and essential molecules, play a crucial role in various biological processes, including growth, cognition, and disease. Through signaling messages to their neighboring proteins, they determine how our bodies function. While scientists were previously able to identify proteins within cells, they lacked knowledge about the specific interactions between proteins. To address this issue, the team developed \u00b5map, a groundbreaking technology that utilizes a photocatalyst to identify spatial relationships on cell surfaces. This catalyst generates a marker that tags proteins and their molecular neighbors, enabling precise mapping of their micro-environment. The applications for this technology extend beyond proteomics, genomics, and neuroscience, and its potential impact on fundamental biology is significant.\n\nMacmillan, Princeton's James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry, is eager to share this technology with scientists in other fields to explore its diverse applications. He believes that the current challenge lies not in tagging molecules, but in distinguishing between distant and proximate proteins. By adopting a radical new approach, the team successfully labeled proteins within close proximity, providing a detailed understanding of the protein neighborhood \u2014 a feat never accomplished before. Macmillan likens this breakthrough to turning on a light switch and suddenly gaining complete visibility in biology.\n\nCo-authors of the research paper, Rob Oslund and Olugbeminiyi Fadeyi from Merck Exploratory Science Center, believe that this technology has the potential to revolutionize biology in both academic and industry life science labs worldwide. Macmillan's group conducted investigations on two categories of human cells. One group consisted of proteins with known interactions, serving as a control group to validate \u00b5map's ability to capture these interactions. The second group focused on proteins associated with the immune system's response to cancer cells, specifically PD-L1 and PD-1. Cancer cells have the ability to deceive the immune system, and this technology provides a means to study and address this challenge.\n\nMacmillan emphasizes the unique collaboration between chemists and biologists in tackling this problem. While chemists may not have a deep understanding of biology, combining their expertise with biologists' insights has revealed the potential for groundbreaking advancements. This technology opens up exciting possibilities for research and discovery, and Macmillan envisions numerous opportunities to leverage this tool for the benefit of scientific exploration and medical progress."}]}

Additionally, they have decided to name the easternmost arch in East Pyne Hall after James Collins \"Jimmy\" Johnson. \n\nBetsey Stockton, once a slave in the Maclean House, the residence of Princeton President Ashbel Green, became a missionary after gaining her freedom. She made significant contributions to the Princeton community, including the founding of the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church and the establishment of the first school in Princeton for children of color. The church has a stained-glass window dedicated to her by her former students. Jimmy Johnson, a fugitive slave from Maryland, worked on campus for over six decades, initially as a janitor and later as a vendor selling fruits, candies, and snacks from a wheelbarrow. Upon his death in 1902, alumni and students purchased a headstone for him in Princeton Cemetery, with an epitaph honoring him as \"the students' friend.\"\n\nThe recommendations to name the garden and the arch were put forth by the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) Committee on Naming. This committee, chaired by History Professor Angela Creager, consists of faculty, students, staff, and alumni. The trustees entrusted the committee to advise them on honorific naming for campus spaces that were referred to the committee by the trustees themselves. Last year, the committee recommended naming Morrison Hall and Arthur Lewis Auditorium. A reception will be held on April 18th from 5 to 7 p.m. in Robertson Hall to celebrate the dedication of Lewis Auditorium, named after Nobel Laureate and Princeton Professor Sir Arthur Lewis (1915-1991). Morrison Hall was dedicated in honor of Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Humanities, Emeritus, during a ceremony last November.\n\nThe decision to name the garden after Betsey Stockton is a tribute to her early years on the Princeton campus and her significant impact on the Princeton community and beyond. The Princeton and Slavery Project, a comprehensive initiative by Princeton scholars and students, explored the historical connection between early university trustees, presidents, faculty, and students with the institution of slavery. The project's findings, made public last fall, highlighted Stockton's remarkable story. Born into slavery around 1798 in Princeton, she was given to Robert Stockton's daughter upon her marriage to Reverend Ashbel Green, who later became the president of the college. Green eventually granted Stockton her freedom, and in 1822, she traveled to Hawaii as a missionary, establishing a school for native Hawaiian children. After relocating to Philadelphia in 1828, she established a school for African American children. In 1833, she returned to Princeton, where she helped establish and taught at the only public school for African American children for almost three decades. She also played a pivotal role in the establishment of what is now known as Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church and led its Sunday school. When Stockton passed away in 1865, her funeral attracted a significant gathering of individuals from both races, and the service was conducted by then-President John Maclean Jr.\n\nThe naming committee recommended that the garden be named after Betsey Stockton as a tribute to the many lives she touched throughout her extraordinary life. They believe it is fitting that the garden, which they hope will serve as a place of beauty and introspection for both the local community and the university, be associated with the library where the Princeton and Slavery Project made numerous discoveries.\n\nOverall, these naming decisions reflect Princeton University's commitment to acknowledging and honoring individuals from diverse backgrounds who have made significant contributions to the university and the wider community."}]}

Created by Paul Ram\u00edrez Jonas, a professor and chair of the art department in the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, this installation aims to create a more inclusive commemorative landscape on the Mall.\n\nThe inspiration for \"Let Freedom Ring\" comes from Marian Anderson's iconic 1939 performance of \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" at the Lincoln Memorial, where she sang after being denied access to Constitution Hall. Ram\u00edrez Jonas pays homage to this historical event and its message of unity and democracy by inviting the public to complete the song. By pulling a lever, participants will activate a hammer inside a 600-pound bell inscribed with the words \"Let Freedom Ring,\" striking the final note of the song with a force that can be both heard and felt. Ram\u00edrez Jonas believes that the completion of the melody lies in the hands of the individuals, as the promise of our country remains incomplete without their participation.\n\nFunded by the Mellon Foundation, the \"Pulling Together\" exhibition is co-curated by Paul Farber, director of the nonprofit Monument Lab, and Salamishah Tillet, a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor at Rutgers University. The six invited artists, including Ram\u00edrez Jonas, Derrick Adams, Tiffany Chung, Ashon T. Crawley, Vanessa German, and Wendy Red Star, were prompted to consider the untold stories on the National Mall. Monument Lab's 2021 audit revealed that the majority of the nearly 50,000 monuments across the country depict white, male figures. Only 6% of the top 50 figures represented are women, with mermaids being more commonly depicted than congresswomen. Ram\u00edrez Jonas sees an opportunity to fill these empty spaces with the narratives of those who encounter them.\n\nLocated above the 12th Street Expressway, accessible from the Smithsonian Metro stop and near the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, \"Let Freedom Ring\" will be seen by over 60,000 people daily. Ram\u00edrez Jonas welcomes all to complete the song \"America,\" which was once considered one of the national anthems. He believes that this artwork reflects the ever-changing nature of the United States, a characteristic not adequately represented in its monuments.\n\n\"Let Freedom Ring\" features a 600-pound bronze bell designed by Ram\u00edrez Jonas. It is the culmination of the installation, supported by four gothic arch-like steel beams and arranged in a spiral with 32 smaller bronze bells. The design, influenced by the physics of suspending heavy bells and considering safety requirements, draws inspiration from traditional church bell towers. Ram\u00edrez Jonas reinterprets these forms to encourage public participation, allowing for reflection and personal connections.\n\nA central theme in Ram\u00edrez Jonas' work is the belief that daily promises and commitments, often overlooked, are essential in building public trust and unity. Through \"Let Freedom Ring,\" he invites individuals to engage in these small social contracts, fostering a sense of community and shared understanding."}]}

Starting on May 28th, residents and visitors will have the opportunity to explore various public, private, and commercial spaces with a specially designed key by Paul Ram\u00edrez Jonas, an esteemed artist and Chair of the Department of Art in the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. This unique experience begins at the unassuming locked door located at the end of platform 1 at Birmingham New Street train station in England.\n\nOver a span of 10 weeks, individuals will embark on an underground journey reminiscent of the world of Harry Potter, leading them to a service tunnel adorned with green ferns and fluorescent lights. This site is just one of more than 20 locations that will be accessible as part of the project, offering a fresh perspective on Birmingham's diverse industrial landscape.\n\n\"Key to the City 2022\" will provide participants with a new understanding of public space, trust, fear, and the concept of being a neighbor, while also encouraging contemplation about the role of civic monuments. Ram\u00edrez Jonas explains, \"We take a symbolic key to the city and use it to open spaces that truly represent the city. Instead of being exclusive to a privileged few, this key can be given by anyone to whomever they choose, for whatever reason they see fit.\"\n\nThe prestigious honor of the \"freedom of the city\" was first awarded in 1888 to Joseph Chamberlain, a prominent British statesman and former mayor of Birmingham. Since then, fewer than 75 individuals and military units have received this distinction. Now, visitors to Birmingham New Street station will have the opportunity to present the symbolic key to a friend, loved one, or even a stranger through a dedicated booth. The recipients of these keys will have the chance to participate in formal ceremonies, where they will cross red carpets, state the person to whom they are awarding the key and why, and have their names recorded in the city archives.\n\nIn New York, a similar project saw over 19,000 keys distributed, resulting in highly emotional exchanges during the ceremonies. In Birmingham, up to 15,000 participants will receive a Yale key engraved with a hand offering a key on one side and a detail from the city's coat of arms on the other. Additionally, participants will receive a passport that catalogs the sites participating in the project.\n\nWith the key in hand, participants can explore various locations, such as an office tower offering a bird's-eye view of the city, a geology museum with hidden cabinets, and a door nestled within a 230-year-old bridge. Other experiences include tasting a menu of traditional recipes at an Indian restaurant and observing prayers at a mosque. The key will also unlock a side door to a sports stadium, provide passage through a gated shopping mall, and grant entry to a small private garden belonging to a local family.\n\nRam\u00edrez Jonas reflects on the importance of this project in reinvigorating public monuments. He notes that many statues of historical figures have lost their cultural significance, with people often disregarding them or using them as props in their daily lives. He believes that true meaning can be found through ownership and active participation. By allowing people to engage with this civic symbol, they can reclaim a sense of ownership over it.\n\n\"Key to the City 2022\" invites individuals to immerse themselves in the vibrant tapestry of Birmingham and discover the true spirit of the city."}]}

The mural, located in the Dryden Road Garage, depicts her grandmothers surrounded by symbols of nature and happiness, such as a deer, a rabbit, tulips, and water lilies. Abuova believes that the mural brings comfort to her parents, as they feel that their mothers are watching over them from heaven. This mural is one of thirteen in the garage, including three created by other Cornell students. Abuova collaborated with Paul Ram\u00edrez Jonas, a professor of art in AAP, and Caleb Thomas, the founder of Ithaca Murals, to bring her vision to life.\n\nAccording to Thomas, murals have the power to bring humanity to otherwise empty walls and transform the cultural landscape of a city. He expresses gratitude to Abuova for being part of this cultural shift and for honoring the difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Abuova, whose family is from Kazakhstan, experienced the hardship her parents faced when their own parents passed away. Her paternal grandmother, Zhibek Bakhtai Kyzy, died in Kazakhstan in March 2021 due to COVID-19 complications, and her breathing tube could not be replaced in time. Similarly, her maternal grandmother, Khadisha Kikimbai Kyzy, passed away in 2018 after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease, and Abuova's mother was unable to be with her at the time.\n\nThrough her mural, Abuova aims to provide closure not only to her parents but also to others who have lost loved ones to illness. She began planning the mural in spring 2021, with the goal of creating an accessible piece as she aspires to make a career as an artist. Abuova discovered Ithaca Murals and reached out to Thomas for assistance. Unfortunately, her grandmother's death from COVID-19 further motivated her to create a memorial that many people could relate to. She used colored pencils to sketch a design based on photographs and worked with Thomas to find a suitable location. In April, she applied for permission from the City of Ithaca to paint the mural at the Dryden Road Garage, which was granted in August.\n\nAbuova embarked on the mural project as an independent study during the fall semester, with Ram\u00edrez Jonas serving as her advisor. Ram\u00edrez Jonas, an expert in public art, closely monitored her progress by visiting the garage weekly and engaging in discussions about public art and artists. Abuova acknowledges that this project challenged her as an artist since she primarily works in the studio on standard-sized canvases using oil paints. Adjusting to the larger scale of the mural was difficult, as she had to ensure that it looked good from a distance as well as up close. Additionally, using exterior house paint, which dries faster than oils, was a new experience for her. She faced setbacks, such as having her progress washed away by rain during one work session, but ultimately, she believes that this project has expanded her artistic capabilities and given her the confidence to tackle any challenge.\n\nAbuova's intention with the mural was to focus on the positive and create a joyful addition to the garage while also serving as a memorial for her grandmothers. She hopes that viewers can find their own grandmothers and loved ones within the mural, making it a personal and meaningful experience for everyone."}]}

The installation consists of 58 poles, each telling a narrative or offering reflections on places named after Christopher Columbus, both directly and indirectly. The intention is to prompt contemplation and engage viewers in considering the historical significance of these places. The installation was designed and constructed by Jennifer Newsom and Tom Carruthers, faculty members from Cornell's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning.\n\nNewsom describes the name \"Columbus\" as an oscillation between a thing and an action, representing the presence of entrenched colonialism in North and South America that extends its influence worldwide. Each pole bears inscriptions, marking current place names in the landscape. According to Newsom, the installation aims to address the diverse ways in which we grapple with these historical trajectories that continue to impact the present day.\n\nColumbus, Indiana, situated between Indianapolis and Lexington, Kentucky, is known for its vibrant architectural and artistic scene. The city boasts numerous buildings designed by renowned architects, such as I. M. Pei, Gunnar Bikerts, and Robert Venturi, among others. Carruthers and Newsom, operating as principals in the architectural firm Dream The Combine, were awarded the 2021 J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize, which gave them the opportunity to design a public art piece. Considering the scale of Columbus, Indiana, the architects connected the name \"Columbus\" to its civic environment.\n\nThe exhibit's 58 flag poles feature a spiral text of stories, counterpoints, and metaphors, creating a captivating reading experience that is choreographed and performative. Newsom emphasizes the invitation for viewers to immerse themselves in the installation, engaging with the texts and gaining knowledge through movement. Each pole highlights different narratives, such as the story of Horace King, a black enslaved architect and engineer who built the first bridge crossing the Chattahoochee River in 1833, later achieving freedom and establishing a successful bridge-building company. King's story transcends historical limitations, human bondage, and racial prejudice, as noted in the text on the pole dedicated to Columbus, Georgia.\n\nThe \"Columbus Columbia Colombo Col\u00f3n\" installation at Mill Race Park offers an enthusiastic exploration of colonialism's impact and encourages viewers to reflect on the interconnectedness of history and the present."}]}

This innovative project, called Tree Folio NYC, creates a detailed 3D model of the city's urban canopy, including the location, type, and size of each tree. Additionally, the model simulates how local conditions, such as street orientation, width, and building height, influence the shading benefits of the trees.\n\nTraditionally, cities have planted trees in uniform rows along streets, but the improved understanding of tree placement's impact on shading can help city planners strategically plant and maintain trees to maximize climate benefits and ensure equal distribution. Alex Kobald, the project lead and associate director of the Design Across Scales Lab in the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning (AAP), emphasizes the importance of comprehending the relationship between trees and their local environment and how it affects their benefits.\n\nThe Design Across Scales Lab, led by J. Meejin Yoon, investigates spatial, social, and environmental challenges related to the built environment, ecology, and technology. The Tree Folio NYC project, developed with the involvement of students and funding from the Design Across Scales Lab at AAP and the Urban Tech Hub, part of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech, explores street trees and the urban canopy as forms of city infrastructure.\n\nKobald has already shared early versions of the tool with municipal agencies and policy advocates. He believes that the open-source nature of the tool makes it scalable to other cities using publicly available data. Kobald highlights the urgency of addressing extreme heat, one of the most significant risks of climate change, particularly for cities. Urban trees play a crucial role in mitigating extreme heat events caused by climate change worldwide.\n\nThe model is constructed using New York City's most recent 2021 3D aerial scan of the five boroughs, which utilizes lidar sensing technology. The researchers developed a method to extract the urban forest from this high-resolution survey, creating an interactive map of trees viewable from any angle. The lidar scan is linked to the city's 2015 tree census, providing detailed information about each tree.\n\nTree Folio NYC allows users to simulate the shade produced by any street tree throughout the year, calculating its impact on public ground, building facades, or its own exposure to sunlight. By comparing neighborhoods with similar physical characteristics but varying street orientations, socioeconomic status, and heat vulnerability indexes, the differences in quality and impact become apparent. For example, Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Pelham Gardens in the Bronx experience more beneficial shading due to larger and more evenly distributed trees, while Ozone Park in Queens is more exposed to intense summer heat.\n\nThe collaboration between the Design Across Scales Lab and the Urban Tech Hub has been instrumental in developing this tool. The project combines the lab's expertise in understanding urban data and its environmental implications with the hub's experience in handling complex data on a large scale.\n\nJ.

When the question specifically addressed the impact of race on climate change, even fewer people believed that some groups are more adversely affected than others.\n\nProfessor Jonathon Schuldt, an associate professor of communication in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the executive director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, expressed curiosity about why the American public misperceives the concerns about environmental issues. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that human-induced climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable people and systems.\n\nTo investigate this issue further, Schuldt and Pearson analyzed data from two national surveys conducted in May and August-September 2022. The results showed that only 37% of respondents believed that climate change affects certain groups more than others, while 46% believed it affects all groups equally. Notably, when the question included the term \"racial groups,\" only 22% of respondents believed that some groups are more affected than others, with 57% believing that all racial groups are affected equally.\n\nAlthough Democrats and younger people were more likely to acknowledge the unequal impact of climate change, Schuldt emphasized that the misperceptions exist across all groups. He found it surprising that even within the Democratic party, a minority recognized the correct response. This suggests that there is a prevailing perception of climate change as a \"common threat\" or \"great equalizer\" that hinders the recognition of climate inequities.\n\nSchuldt also noted the remarkable weakness in the belief that some groups are disproportionately affected when race was mentioned in the question. He highlighted the importance of race as a predictor of exposure to climate-related hazards and suggested that drawing attention to this factor might backfire in raising awareness about climate inequities.\n\nThere is a need for further research by survey researchers to delve into Americans' perceptions of climate injustice. Understanding these perceptions and how they evolve over time can help predict support for policies aimed at reducing climate inequities in the future."}]}

Contrary to previous assumptions, their research reveals that carbon dioxide, and not water, plays a crucial role in initiating these eruptions. By developing new research tools, the scientists have gained insight into the deep internal dynamics and composition of our planet. This information has important implications for improving volcanic-hazards planning.\n\nThe traditional belief among scientists was that shallow magma stored in the Earth's crust, along with water, drove volcanic eruptions. However, the new model developed at Cornell suggests that basaltic volcanoes, which are typically found within tectonic plates, are actually fed by deep magma within the mantle, located about 20 to 30 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface.\n\nSenior author Esteban Gazel, the Charles N. Mellowes Professor in Engineering in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, explained that their data indicates the magma comes directly from the mantle, passing quickly through the crust due to the exsolution process of carbon dioxide. This discovery challenges the existing understanding of volcanic eruptions, which previously centered on water as the primary driver. Instead, it is carbon dioxide that brings magma from the deep Earth.\n\nTo conduct their research, Gazel and Charlotte Devitre developed a high-precision carbon dioxide densimeter for raman spectroscopy. This innovative technique allows scientists to measure microscopic-sized carbon dioxide bubbles trapped in crystals that are emitted during volcanic eruptions. The measurements obtained through this method provide valuable information about the history of the magma.\n\nThis breakthrough technique has been tested in real-time during the eruption in La Palma, Canary Islands in 2021, enabling precise estimations of magma storage. The scientists also developed methods to accurately assess the effect of laser heating on carbon dioxide-rich inclusions and to measure melt inclusion and bubble volumes. By incorporating these advancements, the researchers have achieved a higher level of accuracy in their measurements.\n\nGazel emphasized the significance of this research for understanding volcanic hazards. As deep magma storage cannot be detected by ground deformation until the melt is close to the surface, it is crucial to comprehend the drivers of eruptions. Currently, earthquakes are the only observable indicators, but they do not provide a complete understanding of the processes at play. With precise measurements that reveal the eruption's starting point, the melting of magmas, their storage location, and the triggers of eruptions, scientists can develop more effective plans for future volcanic events.\n\nThe study, titled \"Oceanic Intraplate Explosive Eruptions Fed Directly from the Mantle,\" included contributions from researchers at various institutions and was funded by the National Science Foundation. The data collection was conducted at the Biotechnology Resource Center at Cornell University and the Cornell Institute of Biotechnology's imaging facility, both of which receive funding support from the National Institutes of Health."}]}

With limited space on Earth, it is crucial to find innovative solutions that allow for the cultivation of crops and the preservation of wildlife habitats. By placing photovoltaic panels on lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, we can potentially generate sustainable energy while minimizing the impact on valuable land resources.\n\nLed by Steve Grodsky, an assistant professor of natural resources and the environment in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the research team aims to understand how these panel-topped bodies of water affect aquatic ecosystems. Over the course of three years, they will investigate the impact on various biological components such as microbes, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and fish. In addition, they will analyze factors such as greenhouse gas emissions, algae growth, bioacoustics, and environmental DNA.\n\nThe project has received funding from the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and involves a multidisciplinary team of scientists. Co-principal investigators include Meredith Holgerson, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, Marian Schmidt, an assistant professor of microbiology, and Aaron Rice, a researcher at the K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics.\n\nTo further enhance their research, the team has partnered with Ciel & Terre, a French company specializing in floating solar panel development. With their expertise and experience in deploying over 280 similar projects worldwide, Ciel & Terre will provide valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of this innovative technology.\n\nInterest in water-borne solar panels is growing, as evidenced by the introduction of the \"Power Our Reservoirs Act\" by Representatives Paul Tonko and Jared Huffman. This proposed legislation aims to leverage the benefits of floating solar panels on reservoirs, including land preservation, reduction of harmful algal blooms, and increased clean energy production.\n\nFrom a sustainability perspective, it is crucial to understand the potential impacts on ecosystems before fully embracing this technology. By incorporating scientific rigor into the deployment of floating solar panels, we can ensure a more sustainable and responsible approach to renewable energy development. With the transition to renewable energy sources, it is essential to prioritize long-term sustainability from the outset to avoid any unintended consequences down the line.\n\nThe research team consists of dedicated individuals, including postdoctoral researchers, master's students, and doctoral students, who are working diligently to construct and monitor the panel installations. This project represents an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of floating solar panels and their potential to revolutionize the renewable energy landscape."}]}

In June, the team released 700 silver flies in Fall Creek South Natural Area, alongside a beetle released in 2022. This combined effort aims to provide a long-term biological solution to the adelgid problem, which poses a significant risk to hemlock populations.\n\nThe silver fly, no larger than a grain of rice, and the predatory beetle have been released separately in Cornell Botanic Gardens in the past. However, Fall Creek South is the first area where both species coexist, enabling researchers to observe their effectiveness in combating the hemlock woolly adelgid. This aphid-like insect feeds on hemlock branches, disrupting the flow of vital nutrients and leading to tree death. With the potential to devastate hemlock forests, which play a crucial role in the area's ecosystem, preserving these trees is essential for maintaining biodiversity, hydrology, temperature regulation, and species composition.\n\nBoth the beetle, known as laricobius nigrinus, and the silver fly, called leucotaraxis piniperda, are native to the American Northwest and naturally adapted to colder climates. They prey on adelgids and reproduce twice a year, ensuring a continuous food source. By studying the niche specialization between these predators, researchers aim to determine if they can successfully establish themselves on the East Coast, similar to their native habitat.\n\nTo protect hemlocks, Cornell Botanic Gardens has applied insecticide treatments to over 2,000 trees in 15 natural areas. In preparation for the introduction of biocontrol agents, some hemlocks have been intentionally left untreated, serving as a stable food source for predator populations. The immediate goal is for the predators to establish themselves in the area for three years, indicating their successful integration. The team plans to reassess the situation in 2024, allowing time for predator populations to establish and determine if further pesticide applications are necessary after the release of biocontrol agents.\n\nThe long-term conservation plan for Fall Creek depends on various factors, including the establishment of predator populations, adelgid populations, and the overall health of the trees. Despite uncertainties, the mission remains steadfast: to conserve as many hemlock trees as possible. Even if, in a hundred years, there are hundreds of hemlocks in the area, it will be considered a success."}]}

They successfully integrated key components of an efficient red algae into a tobacco plant using bacteria as a facilitator. This groundbreaking study, featured in Nature Plants, focused on rubisco, the most prevalent protein in all ecosystems. Rubisco carries out the initial step of photosynthesis by fixing carbon, but it struggles to differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide, hindering plant growth and crop yield.\n\nGriffithsia monilis (GM), a type of red algae, possesses a rubisco protein that is 30% more efficient at carbon fixation than rubisco found in terrestrial crops. Scientists have long been interested in transferring this highly efficient GM rubisco into crops like rice, wheat, soybean, and tobacco to boost productivity, but previous attempts were unsuccessful due to the complex folding and assembly process of rubisco. The chaperones needed for rubisco to function properly were mostly unknown in red algae.\n\nHowever, Gunn and her colleagues managed to solve the three-dimensional structure of GM rubisco, enabling them to graft specific regions from a related bacteria, rhodobacter sphaeroides (RS rubisco), which does not require the same chaperones. This modification increased the carboxylation rate by 60%, improved its efficiency by 22%, and enhanced its ability to distinguish between carbon dioxide and oxygen by 7%.\n\nThe researchers then introduced the modified bacterial mutant into tobacco, resulting in a doubling of both photosynthesis and plant growth compared to unaltered RS rubisco. Tobacco was chosen for this experiment due to its suitability for manipulating rubisco. While the modified tobacco has not surpassed the growth of wild-type tobacco, these promising results indicate the potential for significant advancements in plant growth and yield.\n\nGunn emphasizes that even modest improvements in rubisco performance can have a profound impact on agricultural production, biofuel production, carbon sequestration, and various energy applications.

This groundbreaking research has prompted a major pollination company, Plant Products, to swiftly modify the bumblebee hive boxes they supply to growers. The study, which was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology in February, demonstrated that brightly colored commercial bumblebee nest boxes attract wild queens who are seeking to establish their own nests. Unfortunately, when these wild queens enter the nest boxes, they are perceived as invaders by the workers and are subsequently killed. This leads to the loss of wild hives and valuable pollinators in those areas.\n\nThe study also revealed that attaching an existing device known as an excluder to the doorways of the nest boxes proved to be 100% effective in preventing wild queens from entering the hives. In response to these findings, Plant Products, a subsidiary of Biobest in North America, has already equipped all their shipped hives with excluders and provided clear instructions on their use. Furthermore, the company's product manager has personally contacted each client to explain the purpose and benefits of the excluder, which restricts the entrance size to prevent large queens from entering while allowing worker bees to pass through.\n\nHeather Grab, Ph.D., Senior Lecturer in the School of Integrative Plant Science and the corresponding author of the paper, emphasized the significance of this research, stating, \"For every queen lost due to this behavior, we potentially lose an entire colony of bumblebees that provide crucial pollination services later in the season.\" The study, which was conducted by Olivia Miller as part of her undergraduate thesis, found that an average of approximately 10 queens per colony were killed within the study region alone.\n\nAdditionally, the study uncovered a decline in pollination services in areas where commercial bumblebee colonies were used compared to areas where they were not utilized. This decline is believed to be a result of the loss of wild pollinators. The excluders, originally designed for a different purpose, proved to be invaluable when the Cornell researchers made their discovery. Typically, commercial bumblebee nest boxes have two openings, one for entrance and one for exit. These openings can be closed to keep bees inside during crop spraying or to relocate a hive. The excluders, initially intended to cover only the exit to prevent commercial hive queens from escaping and interbreeding with wild bees or spreading diseases, are now being utilized on both entrances to keep wild bees out.\n\nOverall, the bumblebee population has been declining across North America, making early intervention to protect queens in the spring crucial in mitigating these declines. By implementing the use of excluders, Plant Products aims to preserve the wild bee population and maintain vital pollination services."}]}

According to the research, smoke particulates from wildfires could result in between 4,000 and 9,000 premature deaths and cost the United States $36 to $82 billion annually. The study, titled \"Quantifying the Premature Mortality and Economic Loss from Wildfire-Induced PM2.5 in the Contiguous U.S.,\" was published in Science of the Total Environment on June 1.\n\nOliver Gao, the Howard Simpson Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and a senior author of the study, emphasizes that while we often associate air pollution with human activities such as vehicle emissions and factory pollutants, natural sources like wildfires also contribute to air pollution. Gao explains that climate change leads to extreme weather events, including wildfires. He cites the example of Quebec wildfires in June impacting air quality in distant cities like New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington.\n\nThe study's first author, Shuai Pan, a former postdoctoral researcher at Cornell and now affiliated with NUIST's Emergency Management College in China, and senior author Yunsoo Choi, an associate professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Houston, highlight the release of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 during wildfires. These small particles, smaller than a human hair, consist of inhalable organic compounds, aerosols, and metals that can enter the lungs and bloodstream, posing health risks. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive association between exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 and mortality rates and respiratory diseases.\n\nTo conduct their research, the team utilized satellite data on wildfire emissions and air quality from 2012 to 2014. Their updated model assessed the impact of wildfire smoke on human health and economies. The study predicts that metropolitan regions near fire sources, such as Los Angeles, Houston, and Atlanta, will experience a significant health burden and economic losses.\n\nFor example, Los Angeles, situated downwind from fires in the western U.S., could witness 119 premature deaths each year, leading to a financial burden of $1.07 billion. Atlanta, affected by fires in the southern U.S., may experience 76 premature deaths annually, resulting in $690 million in economic fallout. Similarly, Houston could face 65 premature deaths and $580 million in economic losses due to fire-induced particulate matter. The model also estimates that New York City, recently affected by the Quebec wildfire, could see 86 premature deaths and $780 million in associated economic costs.\n\nThe states with the highest number of premature deaths due to wildfire smoke distribution are projected to be California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina. Gao suggests that implementing laws and regulations, such as planned forest thinning events, could help mitigate the harmful effects of wildfires. By removing flammable vegetation, creating green fire breaks, and reducing fuel for fires, the harm of downwind smoke in populated areas can be significantly decreased.\n\nPan adds that local policies and guidance are also crucial in reducing wildfire risks and protecting public health from exposure to hazardous smoke. The study involved collaboration with other institutions, including the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Pusan National University in Korea, Ambri, Inc. in Massachusetts, and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. The research was funded by the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation."}]}

The study also highlights policy approaches aimed at establishing a more resilient battery supply chain. With the majority of EV batteries currently being manufactured overseas, policymakers are eager to leverage reshoring, the practice of moving production to the US, to reduce dependence on foreign imports and mitigate the risks associated with unpredictable global supply chains. However, it is important to consider the impact of reshoring on the country's renewable energy transition and climate goals.\n\nPublished in Science Advances on June 14, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the energy and environmental implications of reshoring lithium-ion EV batteries. The analysis takes into account the entire life cycle of the batteries, including raw material acquisition, component production, manufacturing, distribution, and transportation. The findings suggest that reshoring has the potential to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of US EV batteries and the energy required for their production. However, the extent of these benefits depends on various factors such as technological advancements, supply chain restructuring, and the adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nFor instance, the study reveals that incorporating recycled aluminum and nickel can lead to a carbon footprint reduction of up to 26% for the pre-pandemic US electric vehicle fleet. Fengqi You, the co-lead author of the study and a professor of energy systems engineering at Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, emphasizes the importance of data science and sustainability analytics in shaping future energy, climate, manufacturing, and environmental policies.\n\nThe study also examines the energy and sustainability prospects of an ally-shoring strategy, which involves reallocating production capacities for refined metals and battery components to Japan, South Korea, and European Union countries. The findings indicate that increasing the shares of onshoring and ally production in the future US EV battery supply chain could reduce the carbon footprint by up to 27% compared to the current supply chain configuration. Additionally, incorporating a higher proportion of renewable energy in the power grid and reducing reliance on hard coal and lignite-fired electricity would enhance the environmental sustainability of EV batteries. The study further highlights the potential for a 54% improvement in climate change mitigation benefits through a strategic integration of battery technology advancements and supply chain restructuring.\n\nWhile reshoring can lead to a decrease in ecotoxicity and fine particulate matter formation by over 30% from secondary nickel supply, it is important to note that there is a decline in environmental performance in terms of ozone formation, ozone depletion, and ionizing radiation due to the increased overseas transportation distance for materials.\n\nOverall, this study underscores the significance of informed policy decisions in the areas of energy, climate, manufacturing, and the environment. By leveraging data science and sustainability analytics, policymakers can make informed choices that support the reshoring of EV battery production while prioritizing energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and climate change mitigation."}]}

Excitingly, new research from Cornell University reveals that the metaverse could also offer environmental benefits, potentially reducing the global surface temperature by up to 0.02 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The research paper, titled \"Growing Metaverse Sector Can Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 10 GT CO2e in the United States by 2050,\" was published in Energy and Environmental Science on June 14. The lead author of the paper is Ning Zhao, a doctoral student.\n\nThe researchers employed AI-based modeling to analyze data from key sectors such as technology, energy, environment, and business, to predict the growth of metaverse usage and the impact of its most promising applications, including remote work, virtual traveling, distance learning, gaming, and non-fungible tokens. By projecting metaverse expansion until 2050 along three different trajectories - slow, nominal, and fast - the team aimed to understand the adoption rate based on previous technological advancements like television, the internet, and smartphones. Additionally, the team considered the energy consumption associated with increased metaverse usage.\n\nThe modeling results indicated that within the next 30 years, the metaverse is likely to be adopted by over 90% of the population, a faster growth rate than initially anticipated. Currently, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft are among the prominent drivers in the metaverse industry, with Meta focusing on individual experiences like gaming, and Microsoft specializing in business solutions such as remote conferencing and distance learning. The study suggests that the most significant environmental benefit of the metaverse lies in reducing business travel. By limiting the need for physical transportation, especially for conferences and meetings, the metaverse can contribute to decarbonizing the transportation sector.\n\nThe paper highlights potential environmental gains by 2050, including a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 10 gigatons, a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by 4.0 parts per million, a decrease in effective radiative forcing by 0.035 watts per square meter, and a reduction in total domestic energy consumption by 92 exajoules. This reduction surpasses the annual energy consumption of all end-use sectors in previous years. However, it is important to note that the metaverse alone cannot address all environmental issues. Instead, if used wisely and in conjunction with other efforts, it can make a positive impact in lowering the global surface temperature by up to 0.02 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation."}]}

Kingsbury, a distinguished professor emeritus of botany, transformed a small island in the Gulf of Maine into a dynamic and immersive summer classroom where students could explore and learn about the land and sea. His vision for Appledore Island, Maine, led to the creation of the Shoals Marine Laboratory, a collaborative seasonal field-station between Cornell and the University of New Hampshire.\n\nAt Cornell, Kingsbury taught courses on algae in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. He also authored the textbook \"Poisonous Plants of the United States and Canada\" to specifically train doctors and veterinarians. Kingsbury's dedication to his research took him on an extensive journey across North America, collecting material for his book. He oversaw a poisonous plant garden at Cornell and shared his knowledge with veterinary students. The garden is now located at the Cornell Weed Science Teaching Garden.\n\nIn addition to his work in botany, Kingsbury authored several other books, including \"Deadly Harvest,\" an exploration of plant poisoning in humans and animals, and \"Seaweeds of Cape Cod and the Islands,\" among others. He also reconstructed poet Celia Thaxter's garden on Appledore Island, which is now a popular attraction for visitors.\n\nBorn on July 4, 1928, in Boston, Kingsbury earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts in 1950. He went on to complete his master's and doctorate degrees at Harvard University in 1952 and 1954, respectively. He joined Cornell as an assistant professor in 1954 and spent his career there, eventually becoming a professor and later emeritus in 1983.\n\nKingsbury's passion for marine sciences led him to conceive the idea of a living laboratory on Appledore Island in the 1960s. He spearheaded fundraising efforts and navigated various approvals to bring the project to fruition. The facility officially opened in 1973 and quickly became a hub for students to study marine sciences in a hands-on and immersive environment.\n\nApart from his academic work, Kingsbury served as the director of Cornell Botanic Gardens in 1981-82. Throughout his career, he was recognized for his achievements, including being a U.S. Fulbright Senior Scholar in Australia, a National Science Foundation Faculty Fellow, and a fellow at the American Academy of Veterinary and Comparative Toxicology.\n\nJohn Kingsbury is survived by his wife, Louise, his daughter Joanna Merriam Kingsbury Smith '83, her husband David Smith, his granddaughters Celia Smith Luterbacher '09, M.P.A.

The study focused on 30 small water bodies in temperate regions of Europe and North America, measuring methane and carbon dioxide emissions over the course of the 2018 and 2019 summers.\n\nThe findings revealed that the smallest and shallowest bodies of water demonstrated the highest variability in emissions over time. This knowledge is crucial for accurately calibrating climate models, as it allows for more precise predictions of greenhouse gas emissions from inland water bodies. It also highlights the necessity of further studying small water bodies to gain a comprehensive understanding of their emissions.\n\nPrevious estimates suggested that shallow lakes and ponds contribute approximately 5% of global methane emissions. However, without accurate measurements across a range of water bodies, this number could vary significantly. Some small water bodies emit greenhouse gases consistently, while others exhibit high variability. Understanding these dynamics is crucial due to the potent heat-trapping abilities of methane, which is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.\n\nTo conduct the study, Holgerson and her collaborators at the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network distributed sampling supplies to 16 study co-authors across Europe and North America. These co-authors collected gas samples from a total of 30 small and shallow lakes and ponds, which were then analyzed. Each water body was sampled at three different times in three locations, including the deepest point and two locations on opposite ends.\n\nOne key finding of the study was that smaller water bodies, in terms of surface area, tended to have higher emissions. Additionally, carbon dioxide samples were consistent throughout the water body, suggesting that a single sample from one location could provide an accurate prediction for the entire body. In contrast, methane samples required collection from multiple locations to obtain an accurate measure. Shallower water bodies exhibited more variability in methane emissions, likely due to stratification in deeper water preventing gases from rising to the surface.\n\nTiming also played a role in accurate measurements, with a single summer sample sufficient for carbon dioxide, but multiple samplings required for an average methane emission rate. Furthermore, plant life in the water influenced carbon dioxide variability, while water depth and stratification primarily drove methane variability.\n\nAside from advancing our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from small water bodies, this study has practical applications as well. It serves as a foundation for informing climate mitigation strategies, such as building more ponds to help farmers cope with droughts in New York State. By identifying methods to minimize emissions from ponds, this research contributes to sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nIn conclusion, this study contributes valuable insights into the variability of greenhouse gas emissions from small lakes and ponds. It lays the groundwork for improving climate predictions and highlights the importance of further research in this field. The findings also have practical implications, offering opportunities for mitigating climate change and supporting agricultural resilience."}]}

The freeze caused significant damage to burgeoning grapevine shoots, potentially leading to reduced crop yields and economic loss for vineyards. As part of their efforts, the experts conducted a tour of freeze-damaged vineyards in the Finger Lakes region with the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. The damage, which occurred in mid-May, affected vineyards in the Finger Lakes and Hudson Valley wine regions. The hardest-hit area was found to be the vineyards around Keuka Lake, with approximately 50% of their acreage affected. Damage varied in the vineyards around Seneca and Cayuga Lakes. Evaluation of the frost damage is also being conducted for other crops, such as apples, blueberries, raspberries, and cherries. During a meeting, the viticulture experts and officials from the Farm Services Agency discussed efforts to obtain a federal-disaster designation, though this process may take several months to more than a year due to economic fact-finding and data collection. Growers were advised to document and photograph the extent of the damage in case they needed to file insurance claims or if a disaster declaration was made by the state or federal governments. The freeze damage occurred in the early cultivars, as they were further along in development. Protecting vineyards from frost remains a challenging task, as there are limited methods to prevent freezing once water is present in the plant cells. Frost timing and plant development vary each year, making it difficult to develop effective mitigation techniques for every freeze event."}]}

One of the notable projects focuses on understanding the impact of a devastating heat wave on humpback whale songs and raising awareness about climate change.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2016, a severe heat wave affected the Pacific Ocean, leading to alarming declines in marine creatures, including humpback whales. In Southeastern Alaska, humpback whale abundance dropped by 56% during and after the heat wave, with no signs of recovery to pre-2013 levels. In response, a team of Cornell researchers and external partners aims to investigate how this heat wave impacted humpback whale songs, which are crucial for their mating behavior.\n\nConsidering the predicted increase in both frequency and intensity of marine heat waves as the planet continues to warm, understanding their effects on wildlife becomes paramount. The Cornell Atkinson Center's Academic Venture Fund (AVF) has selected this project, along with ten others, for funding, totaling $1.6 million. This annual initiative, which has been supporting interdisciplinary research since 2008, focuses on promoting environmental sustainability.\n\nThe humpback whale study is co-led by Annie Lewandowski, a senior lecturer in the Department of Music, and Katy Payne '59, a renowned bioacoustics researcher in the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics. These two experts have been collaborating since 2017.\n\nTo carry out this research, the project will bring together artists and scientists from two nonprofits, the Hawaii Marine Mammal Consortium and the Sound Science Research Collective, as well as the federal Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. By documenting and analyzing the structure of humpback whale songs in breeding grounds in Hawaii and foraging grounds in Alaska, the team aims to determine the impact of the heat wave and population decline.\n\nThe researchers also intend to disseminate their findings through diverse media platforms and scientific publications, emphasizing the importance of public engagement in addressing these ocean-scale changes. Annie Lewandowski highlights the significance of the public's appreciation for these captivating whale songs, which in turn can lead to a greater understanding of the challenges whales face in today's oceans. Katy Payne adds that there is hope that whales can inspire humanity to change our destructive course.\n\nCornell Atkinson's AVF grants have been instrumental in fostering interdisciplinary research and expanding the university's commitment to sustainability. Descriptions of this year's AVF winners are available on the Cornell Atkinson website. The selection process involves multiple faculty review panels, prioritizing proposals with the potential to extend research beyond the campus through external funding and partnerships.\n\nDavid Lodge, the Francis J. DiSalvo Director of Cornell Atkinson, emphasizes the center's mission to drive research into action for the betterment of people and the planet. To achieve this mission, collaborations with government agencies, corporations, and non-governmental organizations are crucial.

Originally published in 1997 by Cornell University Press and authored by a team of Cornell researchers, this guide quickly became a staple in the field for botanists, home gardeners, landscape managers, pest control specialists, and allergists across the region. One of the featured weeds, ground ivy (glechoma hederacea), has been commonly found in turfgrass and is just one of the over 500 species covered in the book. Over the past 25 years, the book has sold nearly 100,000 copies, making it a top seller for the press. \n\nHowever, as times change, so does the flora. In March, Cornell University Press released the second edition of \"Weeds of the Northeast,\" which includes more than 200 new species that have slowly invaded the region, such as waterhemp, Japanese stiltgrass, and garlic mustard. The updated edition also addresses the omission of certain weeds present in the first guide, including the wild parsnip. Additionally, the book expands its coverage to include more species from the mid-Atlantic states and upper Midwest, and updates its terminology to reflect current understanding. \n\nThe creation of this new edition is the result of a remarkable coincidence involving two individuals with the surname DiTommaso. It began with Richard Uva, who developed the original \"Weeds of the Northeast\" as his master's thesis. He collaborated with faculty members from the Department of Horticulture and the Department of Crop, Soil, and Atmospheric Sciences (now known as the School of Integrative Plant Science Horticulture Section and Soil and Crop Sciences Section) to produce the manuscript. Associate Professor Joseph Neal and Weed Science Professor Joseph DiTommaso were key contributors to the project. The team reached out to researchers throughout the northeast for suggestions of weeds to include, as well as images of their various characteristics. Balancing the desire for comprehensive information with the need for a practical, portable size was a challenge for the team.\n\nAmong the difficult choices, DiTommaso was particularly excited to include the wild parsnip, a weed that had been inexplicably overlooked in the first edition. This oversight did not go unnoticed, and other notable additions to the updated guide include the troublesome summer annual weed, Palmer amaranth, and the fast-spreading perennial weed, lesser celandine. The book also covers well-known culprits like swallowwort, kudzu, and common ragweed. While these weeds are often seen as nuisances for gardeners, DiTommaso hopes that \"Weeds of the Northeast\" fosters an appreciation for their ecological roles as well. In fact, DiTommaso uses both editions of the book in his fall semester weed biology and management course, a fitting choice as the original guide was a valuable resource for him during his undergraduate and graduate studies in Canada.\n\nThe release of the second edition of \"Weeds of the Northeast\" has been met with enthusiasm, and DiTommaso has found himself signing many copies, feeling a bit like a star. This updated guide will continue to serve as a valuable tool for professionals and enthusiasts alike, aiding in the identification and management of invasive plants in the region."}]}

This finding has significant implications for both climate change mitigation and the improvement of soil health for agricultural purposes.\n\nPublished in Nature on May 24, the study, titled \"Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency Promotes Global Soil Carbon Storage,\" introduces a novel approach that combines a microbial computer model with data assimilation and machine learning. By analyzing extensive data related to the carbon cycle, the researchers measured microbial carbon use efficiency, which measures the amount of carbon used by microbes for growth versus metabolism.\n\nThe study revealed that the role of microbes in carbon storage is at least four times more important than any other process, including biomatter decomposition. Given that Earth's soils contain three times more carbon than the atmosphere, it becomes evident that the study's findings offer crucial insights into soil's potential as a carbon sink in the fight against climate change.\n\n\"This work highlights the paramount importance of microbial carbon use efficiency in soil carbon storage,\" stated Yiqi Luo, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science. He further emphasized how these insights can guide agricultural researchers in studying farm management practices that influence microbial carbon use efficiency, leading to improved soil health and enhanced food security.\n\nFuture studies may explore strategies to increase overall soil carbon sequestration by microbes, as well as investigate the impact of different types of microbes and substrates on soil carbon storage, particularly those high in sugars.\n\nWhile soil carbon dynamics have been studied for centuries, this study marks the first time that researchers have been able to assess the relative significance of microbial processes compared to other factors.

This acquisition represents a significant step in further protecting the county's most mature trees, some of which are over 300 years old. The partnership between Cornell University, Shamrock Communities, LLC, Finger Lakes Land Trust (FLLT), and Tompkins County made this addition possible.\n\nTo cover the closing costs and initial property maintenance, the Botanic Gardens secured grant money from the county's Natural Infrastructure Capital Program. This grant required that the land be permanently protected, which will be achieved through a conservation easement with FLLT. This easement will ensure the land is safeguarded from future development indefinitely.\n\nThe total area of the natural area is now 181 acres, with an expanded and rerouted trail already open to the public through the newly acquired land. This expansion allows visitors to experience the unique ecosystem of the Fischer Old-Growth Forest.\n\nThe original 31.2-acre forest was acquired by the university in 1997 after successful negotiations with the Cotton-Hanlon Lumber Company of Alpine, New York. This acquisition prevented the ancient trees from being logged. In honor of Richard B. Fischer, a beloved professor of environmental education at Cornell University, the forest was named in 1998. Professor Fischer's passion for environmental protection and his contribution to natural history education made him a respected figure among his students and colleagues.\n\nOver the years, Cornell University has continued to expand the protected area around the forest. Adjoining 10 acres were purchased in 2000, and in 2015 and 2017, David Bandler, an emeritus professor of food science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and his wife Lenore generously donated 17.6 acres and 41.8 acres, respectively.\n\nThe preserve offers visitors a fascinating journey through time, with remnants of an old barn foundation near the trail's entrance, followed by abandoned shrub and young forest areas that were previously used for agricultural purposes. The trail culminates in the magnificent old-growth forest, where 300-year-old trees stand tall, providing a glimpse into the region's rich history.\n\nIn addition to protecting the forest and its ancient trees, this acquisition is also vital for flood protection. With the increasing precipitation and extreme weather events, preserving existing wetlands and managing them to maintain their integrity becomes crucial. The 25-acre wetland within the natural area will continue to provide flood protection for downstream areas, benefiting not only the environment but also the surrounding communities.\n\nCornell Botanic Gardens is thrilled to have acquired this additional land, which allows us to safeguard these valuable natural resources for generations to come. We are grateful for the collaboration and support from our partners and donors, without whom this achievement would not have been possible."}]}

Their findings suggest that there is a behavioral component at play when scientists choose their collaborators. Y. Samuel Wang, the author of the study, stated that the observed gender homophily in the broader scientific landscape cannot be solely attributed to varying levels of gender representation.\n\nThe research team consisted of scholars in statistics, information science, biology, and philosophy. They analyzed a large corpus of articles published between 1960 and 2011 from the online repository JSTOR. To determine the genders of more than 800,000 author names, the team relied on social security records and crowdsourced data. It is important to note that this research only focused on men and women authors and did not consider nonbinary identities.\n\nThe team grouped authors from the same fields and eras, creating hypothetical reconfigurations of authors to compare against the observed data. The researchers found significant differences between the actual data and the hypothetical scenarios, indicating that some other form of homophily is present.\n\nAlthough the research cannot definitively explain why researchers tend to collaborate with those of the same gender, the findings suggest that gender may play a role. Intent cannot be measured using data science methods, but the team's research provides evidence to support the consideration of gender as a factor in collaboration choices.\n\nThe co-authors of this study from the University of Washington are Carole J.

The grant will support Dr. Sonnenberg's investigation into the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\nThe grant, awarded under the Method for Extending Research in Time (MERIT) program, will fund research on a novel pathway that protects the intestine from damage and inflammation caused by a factor called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), derived from the immune system. Dr. Sonnenberg expressed his excitement and gratitude for the opportunity to advance his research over an extended period of time.\n\nThe MERIT program provides a five-year award to researchers with outstanding records of research accomplishment, with the possibility of extending the award for up to five additional years without undergoing another competitive peer review. Dr. Sonnenberg's proposal was based on his laboratory's pioneering research over the past decade, which focused on characterizing key immune cell pathways in the intestine. Understanding the shift that causes TNF to become a major mediator of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, is a major mystery in the field.\n\nCurrent therapies that block TNF to reduce inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases have limited effectiveness and can lose efficacy over time. Dr. Sonnenberg's team discovered that TNF-induced gut inflammation is associated with the depletion of a special class of cells called group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which are abundant in a healthy intestine. This discovery led to the hypothesis that ILC3s keep TNF in check and prevent it from driving tissue inflammation.\n\nExperiments conducted by Dr. Sonnenberg's team confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating that ILC3s are essential for protecting the intestine from TNF-induced damage and inflammation. With the support of the MERIT award, the team will further investigate the cellular and molecular signals by which ILC3s protect against TNF-induced inflammation. This research will involve both mouse models and patient-based organoids, which are complex human cell culture systems that mimic the guts of healthy individuals or those with IBD.\n\nDr. Sonnenberg and his laboratory originally applied for a standard \"R01\" grant from the NIH, which received a fundable score after peer-review. They were subsequently nominated by NIH program staff for the MERIT award instead. Each year, NIAID issues approximately 15 new MERIT awards. This new award will allow for a more in-depth understanding of IBD and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies."}]}

This funding will support the first study to compare the effectiveness of two revascularization options for coronary artery disease in women, black, and Hispanic patients.\n\nCoronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, with over 1 million Americans undergoing procedures annually to restore normal blood flow to the heart. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting stents into the coronary artery through small incisions in the groin or wrist. It requires minimal anesthesia and allows patients to go home the same day. On the other hand, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is a more invasive procedure that requires opening the chest under general anesthesia. Surgeons create grafts using arteries or veins taken from the chest, arms, or legs to bypass blocked coronary arteries. CABG involves a longer hospital stay and recovery time, as well as higher rates of complications during surgery compared to PCI. However, it offers longer-lasting benefits, including a lower risk of heart attack and the need for repeat intervention.\n\nA significant portion of patients who must choose between PCI and CABG are women or racial groups that have been underrepresented in previous clinical trials. This lack of representation has left these patients with limited guidance when making informed decisions. The Revascularization Choices Among Underrepresented Groups Evaluation (RECHARGE) research program aims to fill this gap by conducting two parallel clinical studies \u2013 RECHARGE Women and RECHARGE Minorities \u2013 that will enroll 600 participants at up to 60 study sites, primarily in the United States. Patients for whom both PCI and CABG are equally suitable options, as determined by their local heart team, will be randomly assigned to receive either procedure. The trials will span five years, following an 18-month feasibility phase.\n\nPrevious randomized controlled trials of surgical options for coronary artery disease have primarily focused on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke, and the need for repeat procedures. However, through focus groups, Dr. Gaudino and his colleagues discovered that patients prioritize survival and quality of life when faced with a choice between PCI and CABG. The RECHARGE program will, therefore, evaluate these outcomes as the primary measures of success.\n\nDr. Gaudino, who also serves as the Director of the Joint Clinical Trials Office and the Director of Translational and Clinical Research in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine, will oversee the RECHARGE program, including study startup and patient recruitment strategies.

Two separate publications from astronomers involved in JWST's Early Release Science Program have reported groundbreaking discoveries regarding Ganymede, the largest moon, and Io, the most volcanically active moon.\n\nIn a study led by Samantha Trumbo, a 51 Pegasi B postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Astronomy at the College of Arts and Sciences, the team detected the presence of hydrogen peroxide on Ganymede's poles using measurements captured by JWST's near-infrared spectrometer. This finding suggests that charged particles from Jupiter and Ganymede are impacting the ice on the moon, altering its surface chemistry. The researchers believe that these charged particles break the water molecules into fragments, causing them to recombine and form hydrogen peroxide. This phenomenon is primarily observed around the poles of Ganymede due to its unique magnetic field, which directs charged particles towards these regions. Trumbo emphasizes that Ganymede's magnetic field, similar to Earth's, not only creates aurorae but also affects the icy surface.\n\nTrumbo, along with Michael Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, had previously studied hydrogen peroxide on Europa, another of Jupiter's Galilean satellites. However, the peroxide was found to be detectable over a larger portion of Europa's surface, possibly due to the absence of a magnetic field that would protect it from the fast-moving particles near Jupiter. Trumbo suggests that understanding water radiolysis and its impact on icy bodies throughout the outer solar system, including neighboring Europa and Callisto, is crucial.\n\nThe second publication, accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, reports new JWST observations of Io, the only volcanically active moon in the solar system. These observations reveal ongoing eruptions, including a brightening at the volcanic complex known as Loki Patera, as well as an exceptionally bright eruption at Kanehekili Fluctus. Io's volcanism is fueled by Jupiter's gravitational forces, offering planetary scientists a unique perspective compared to studying volcanic activity on Earth.\n\nLead author Imke de Pater, a professor emerita of Astronomy and Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley, highlights the significance of these findings. She emphasizes that the James Webb Space Telescope is capable of conducting remarkable scientific research on solar system objects, even those as bright as Jupiter or faint objects adjacent to it.

This groundbreaking study utilized natural language processing (NLP) tools to analyze transcripts of the jury selection process and identified significant differences in how prosecutors questioned black and white prospective jurors.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant. Once validated, this technology could serve as crucial evidence in appeals cases and be utilized in real-time during jury selection to ensure the formation of more diverse juries. Professor Blume, one of the researchers involved in the study, explains that NLP software allows for a sophisticated analysis of not just the quantity, but also the quality of questions posed to potential jurors.\n\nThe study sheds light on the tactic employed by prosecutors, assuming that black and female jurors may display more sympathy towards a black defendant. Prosecutors sometimes employ this approach by asking graphic and disturbing questions about the execution process and gauging the willingness of the prospective juror to sentence the defendant to death. If the response is unfavorable, the individual is dismissed from the jury pool.\n\nTo test the effectiveness of NLP software in identifying such biased practices, the researchers collaborated with Professor Wells and analyzed transcripts from 17 capital cases in South Carolina. Their dataset consisted of over 26,000 questions posed by judges, defense attorneys, and prosecutors to potential jurors. Not only did the analysis reveal differences in the quantity of questions asked to black and white individuals, but also their complexity, sentiment, and the topics covered. Importantly, racial differences were consistently observed in these measures, whereas no such disparities were found in the questions asked by judges and the defense.\n\nThe study also provided evidence that prosecutors attempted to disqualify black individuals by probing their views on the death penalty. Black prospective jurors, particularly those who were ultimately excused from serving, were subjected to more explicit and graphic questions about execution methods compared to their white counterparts.\n\nThe findings of this research highlight the successful application of NLP tools in identifying biased jury selection. The researchers now hope to expand the scope of these studies by examining larger datasets encompassing a broader range of cases. Once the validity of this method is established, it could be implemented in real-time during jury selection, significantly diversifying juries. This software holds great potential, particularly for defendants facing the death penalty, as it can be utilized to monitor jury selection or provide evidence for appeals."}]}

However, two researchers from Cornell University believe that this form of \"self-reported signaling\" can ultimately have positive effects. Michael Waldman, the Charles H. Dyson Professor of Management at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, explains that while using resume padding to obtain a job one is not qualified for is detrimental, it can lead to decreased misrepresentation in the long run. Waldman, along with Thomas Jungbauer, an assistant professor of strategy and business economics, has published a study titled \"Self-Reported Signaling\" in the American Economic Journal Microeconomics. The study explores the difference between traditional signaling and self-reported signaling, where the latter allows for the possibility of lies. A CV serves as an example of self-reported signaling, as it contains information that is not widely known and is expected to be accurate. While some aspects of a CV such as education and previous employment can be verified, others like leadership qualities and work ethic cannot. The researchers developed a model that considers a single job applicant and a group of hiring officers. The applicant, in this case, can choose to include an action, such as education level, that can be verified but at a high cost. The model takes into account the veracity of the resumes, the willingness of hiring officers to verify information, and the risks and benefits of dishonesty regarding education levels. The researchers found two significant results from their modeling. Firstly, the possibility of resume padding reduces the value of investing in higher education, as the uncertainty surrounding its accuracy decreases the amount hiring officers are willing to pay. Secondly, the subsequent reduction in investments in education can counterbalance the overinvestment typically associated with signaling, ultimately increasing social welfare. The researchers also applied their model to college admissions, specifically in the realm of self-reported extracurricular activities and leadership roles. They found that the possibility of misrepresentation reduces excessive investment in these activities and may actually increase overall social welfare. This research challenges the notion that lying is always negative, as misrepresentation can reduce the distortions caused by signaling, thus benefiting society. Waldman suggests that the widespread coverage of cases like George Santos, who misrepresented his past, could discourage similar behavior. Both Waldman and Jungbauer are affiliated with the field of economics at Cornell University, in addition to their primary appointments at Johnson."}]}

This phenomenon, known as \"load imbalance,\" was found to disproportionately affect hospitals that served a larger number of Black patients and Medicaid enrollees, according to a recent study conducted by investigators from Weill Cornell Medicine.\n\nThe study, published on July 5th in Health Affairs, sheds light on the need for improved coordination of patient transfers to alleviate overcapacity and address disparities in healthcare access. William L. Schpero, Assistant Professor of Population Health Sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine and senior author of the study, emphasized the importance of this research in highlighting the prevalence of load imbalance during the pandemic and identifying the types of hospitals affected.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Adam S. Vohra, an interventional cardiology fellow at Weill Cornell Medicine, explained that the researchers analyzed data from 290 hospital referral regions (HRRs), which represent specific geographic areas designated as hospital markets. The data on hospital capacity was obtained from the COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity files provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe findings revealed that 53.1% of the HRRs experienced load imbalance during the study period, which spanned from July 31, 2020, to March 4, 2022. Regions with higher proportions of Black residents were more likely to face load imbalance. Additionally, hospitals with a greater proportion of Medicaid patients and Black Medicare patients were significantly more likely to be overwhelmed while other hospitals had available capacity.\n\nSchpero stated that the estimate of load imbalance used in the study was conservative, suggesting that the prevalence of this issue may be even higher than reported. He explained that some of the overloaded hospitals likely lacked sufficient staff, beds, or supplies to meet patient needs, while these resources were available elsewhere. Schpero also noted that many states have historically lacked the necessary infrastructure to address capacity constraints across hospitals and reallocate patients accordingly. However, some states, such as Arizona, Minnesota, and Washington, have implemented centralized coordinating hubs to manage transfer requests during surges, thereby relieving the burden on overwhelmed hospitals.\n\nVohra emphasized the potential benefits of such coordinating hubs, although the study did not investigate their causal effects on outcomes. He highlighted the importance of timely data on patient needs and bed availability across hospitals for effective patient transfers. Weekly reporting mechanisms were deemed inadequate, and Schpero called for preexisting agreements among hospitals, either voluntary or mandated by state law, to share real-time data on hospital capacity and facilitate transfers.\n\nAs the urgency of the pandemic has diminished, Schpero urged policymakers and healthcare stakeholders to capitalize on the lessons learned and invest in policies and practices that promote equitable patient care. The goal is to ensure that, in the face of future pandemics or natural disasters, compromises on healthcare access and quality are not necessary."}]}

We have introduced a new technology that allows for the cleansing of patients' blood outside of their bodies. This innovative advancement opens up a range of new treatment options, including dialysis for animals with kidney failure and immune-mediated diseases. \n\nOur new technology, known as an extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) unit, became operational this spring for cats and dogs. It is worth noting that only around 35 other animal hospitals in the country possess such capabilities, making Cornell the sole provider in the region. The nearest facilities offering this technology are located in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\nDr. Jethro Forbes, Assistant Clinical Professor in the Section of Emergency and Critical Care, expressed his excitement about this development: \"The ability to provide dialysis and other extracorporeal blood purification to the patients in the upstate New York region is a game changer for our veterinary hospital. Among other things, we can act as your pet's artificial kidneys, giving their resilient organs a chance to heal.\"\n\nWhile kidney dialysis is a standard treatment for humans, it is less common in veterinary practices due to the specialized training required to operate the technology effectively. However, this community of high-level practitioners is growing rapidly. The EBP unit not only improves the lives of animals but also offers multiple benefits. Dialysis for pets with kidney failure is one of the most common uses of the unit, as it effectively cleanses the patient's blood of bodily toxins, functioning similarly to a natural kidney. For animals whose kidneys cannot function properly, dialysis can be a lifesaving intervention.\n\nAnother valuable application of the EBP unit is the removal of toxins or drugs from the bloodstream. This is particularly useful when pets ingest substances they shouldn't, such as medications or chemicals. By cleansing the blood of harmful substances, such as antifreeze or anti-inflammatory drugs, the unit prevents damage to the organs.\n\nFurthermore, the EBP unit can aid in managing immune system dysfunction through a therapy known as therapeutic plasma exchange. This is especially beneficial for animals with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, a severe and life-threatening condition that requires specialized care. Therapeutic plasma exchange removes harmful elements of the malfunctioning immune system, allowing medications to have a more significant impact.\n\nThe possibilities for expanding the capabilities of the EBP unit are vast. We aim to configure the unit to accommodate more species, including horses, pigs, and goats. Additionally, we are exploring the use of different components that could clear patients' blood of bacteria and viruses. In the future, this unit could even contribute to cutting-edge cancer therapies and bone marrow transplants.\n\nDr. Forbes expressed his enthusiasm for the future: \"It's exciting to see what lies ahead. Currently, we are thrilled to offer this treatment to dogs and cats at Cornell while also training the next generation of veterinary specialists to provide this care to even more pets.\""}]}

To investigate this, researchers conducted a study using entries from the New Yorker magazine's cartoon caption contest as a test. They presented AI models and humans with three tasks: matching a joke to a cartoon, identifying a winning caption, and explaining why a winning caption is humorous. In all three tasks, humans outperformed machines, despite advancements in AI such as ChatGPT that have narrowed the performance gap. While machines are making progress in understanding humor, they have not fully reached that level yet.\n\nTo evaluate the comprehension of AI models, researchers created tests, such as multiple-choice assessments, to measure accuracy. If a model surpasses human performance on these tests, one may question whether it truly understands humor. However, understanding is fundamentally a human attribute, so it can be argued that no machine can truly possess it. Nonetheless, it is still remarkable to observe how well machines perform on these tasks, regardless of their understanding. Jack Hessel, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, emphasizes the impressive nature of their performance.\n\nFor this study, the researchers collected over 700 caption contests from the New Yorker spanning 14 years. Each contest consisted of a cartoon without a caption, along with the week's entries, three finalists chosen by New Yorker editors, and, in some cases, crowd quality assessments for each submission. The researchers tested two types of AI models, one based on computer vision (analyzing the images directly) and the other based on analyzing human summaries of the cartoons. Both models were evaluated on the three tasks.\n\nThe New Yorker case presents an interesting challenge because the relationship between the images and the captions is indirect, playful, and often references real-world entities and norms. Understanding this relationship requires a higher level of sophistication. In the experiment, matching required AI models to select the correct finalist caption from a set of distractors that were finalists in other contests. Quality ranking required models to distinguish between finalist and non-finalist captions, while explanation task required models to generate free text explaining how a high-quality caption relates to the cartoon. As crowdsourcing the explanation task proved unsatisfactory, the majority of human-generated explanations were written by Hessel himself, with over 650 cartoons receiving 60-word explanations.\n\nAlthough AI may not fully comprehend humor at this stage, the authors suggest that it could be a valuable collaborative tool for humorists to brainstorm ideas.

The Cornell Botanic Gardens staff and Cornell's New York State Hemlock Initiative recently released 700 silver flies in the Fall Creek South Natural Area in June. Additionally, a beetle will be introduced in 2022. This approach offers a promising long-term biological solution to address the significant threat posed by the hemlock woolly adelgid to hemlock populations.\n\nWhile both the silver flies and the beetle have been released separately in the past, Fall Creek South will be the first area where they coexist, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness in combating the hemlock woolly adelgid. Hemlocks play a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing a cool, shaded habitat for specific plants and animals to thrive. Their roots also help filter water and prevent soil erosion, improving water quality. Moreover, the dense shade of hemlock trees delays snow melt in the spring, ensuring adequate stream-flows for trout and other fish.\n\nBoth the beetle, laricobius nigrinus, and the silver fly, leucotaraxis piniperda, are native to the American Northwest and are well-suited to colder climates. These natural predators feed on adelgids and have evolved to adapt to their presence. The silver fly, in particular, reproduces twice a year, enabling it to effectively target hemlock woolly adelgids during their reproductive cycles.\n\nNick Dietschler, a research support specialist from the Hemlock Initiative, explains that the coexistence of these predators is significant: \"You have these predators that are essentially feeding on the same thing. In our research, we aim to understand their niche specialization. Given their co-evolution, it is likely that they will find similar niches on the East Coast as they do in their native Northwest.\"\n\nTo protect hemlock trees in Fall Creek, the Cornell Botanic Gardens' natural area stewards have treated over 2,000 trees with insecticide bark applications and trunk injections in 15 natural areas. However, in preparation for the introduction of biological control methods, some hemlocks have been intentionally left untreated. This strategy ensures that there will be a stable population of hemlock woolly adelgids to sustain the predator populations, allowing them to establish themselves successfully. The short-term objective is for the predators to remain in the area for three years, indicating their establishment.\n\nThe researchers have high hopes that the silver fly, known for its strong flying abilities, will gradually spread and assist hemlocks in the surrounding areas. As the current pesticide applications have a lifespan of five to seven years, many trees in Fall Creek will require reapplication soon. The team plans to reassess the area in 2024, giving the predator populations sufficient time to establish a presence. This evaluation will help determine if the continued use of pesticides is necessary after the release of biocontrol agents.\n\nThe long-term conservation plan for Fall Creek depends on several factors, including the establishment of predator populations, the status of hemlock woolly adelgid populations, and the condition of the trees. Despite the uncertainties, the mission remains unwavering: to conserve as many hemlock trees as possible. As Bittner, a team member, emphasizes, \"If, in 100 years, we have hundreds of hemlocks in this area, that's a success.\""}]}

Their study, which was featured on the cover of the June 8 issue of Nature Plants, focused on rubisco, the most abundant protein found in all ecosystems. Rubisco plays a crucial role in photosynthesis by fixing carbon, but it struggles to differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide, limiting plant growth and crop yield.\n\nThe researchers aimed to transplant a highly efficient rubisco enzyme found in red algae, specifically Griffithsia monilis (GM), into various plants to increase their productivity. However, previous attempts had failed due to the complexity of rubisco's folding process, which requires several essential \"chaperones\" to be active. Most of these chaperones in red algae were unknown.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, Gunn and her colleagues successfully determined the 3D structure of GM rubisco. They used this information to graft specific regions from a bacterial rubisco, called Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RS), into the GM rubisco. Although RS rubisco is not very efficient, it closely resembles GM rubisco, making it compatible for grafting. Unlike land-plant rubisco, RS rubisco does not require special chaperones to fold and assemble in plants.\n\nThis genetic modification significantly improved the carboxylation rate, carboxylation efficiency, and the ability of the RS rubisco to differentiate between carbon dioxide and oxygen. The researchers then introduced this modified bacterial rubisco into tobacco plants, which resulted in a doubling of photosynthesis and plant growth compared to unaltered rubisco.\n\nTobacco was chosen as the test case for this research because it is the easiest land plant to manipulate rubisco. The ultimate goal is to develop a more efficient rubisco that can be transferred to other economically important crops such as rice, wheat, soybean, and more.\n\nAlthough the researchers have not yet surpassed the performance of wild-type tobacco, they are optimistic about the potential of their findings. Even small improvements in rubisco performance can have a significant impact on plant growth and yield over a growing season. This has implications for higher agricultural production, more efficient biofuel production, carbon sequestration, and artificial energy possibilities.\n\nThe research was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis, Formas Future Research Leaders, and the European Regional Development Fund."}]}

The study, which involved a large and diverse group of healthy adults, provides the strongest evidence to date of the association between omega-3 fatty acids and lung health. The researchers emphasize the importance of including omega-3 fatty acids in the diet, particularly as many Americans do not meet current dietary guidelines.\n\nAccording to Patricia A. Cassano, the Alan D. Mathios Professor in the College of Human Ecology and Director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences, there has been limited research on the role of diet in chronic lung disease compared to cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This study contributes to the growing evidence that omega-3 fatty acids, a component of a healthy diet, may be crucial for lung health.\n\nThe researchers note a rising interest in exploring whether nutritional interventions can prevent lung disease. While previous studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful due to their anti-inflammatory properties, there has been a lack of robust studies on this association. To address this, the researchers conducted a two-part study to examine the link between omega-3 fatty acid levels in the blood and lung function over time.\n\nIn the first part of the study, a longitudinal observational study involving over 15,000 diverse Americans was conducted as part of the NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study, which is a collection of NIH-funded studies focused on personalized risk factors for chronic lung disease. The results showed that higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the blood were associated with a slower decline in lung function. The researchers found the strongest associations with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid abundantly found in fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and sardines. DHA is also available as a dietary supplement.\n\nIn the second part of the study, the researchers analyzed genetic data from over 500,000 European participants in the UK Biobank. They studied specific genetic markers in the blood as an indirect measure of dietary omega-3 fatty acid levels and their correlation with lung health. The results demonstrated that higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, were associated with better lung function.\n\nIt is important to note that the study only included healthy adults. As part of an ongoing project, the researchers are collaborating with the COPDGene Study to examine the association between blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids and the rate of decline in lung function among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including heavy smokers. This will help determine if the same beneficial associations are found in this population.\n\nOverall, the research marks a significant step towards precision nutrition for treating lung diseases. In the future, this could lead to individualized dietary recommendations for individuals at high risk for chronic lung disease. The current dietary guidelines for Americans recommend consuming at least two to three servings of fish per week, a goal that is not met by most Americans. In addition to fish and fish oil, other sources of omega-3 fatty acids include nuts and seeds, plant oils, and fortified foods."}]}

The team's objective is to develop a new generation of biosynthetic lubricants that show promise in the treatment of arthritis and the reduction of friction in artificial joints. This groundbreaking research aims to improve the lives of individuals suffering from joint pain.\n\nThe team's progress is exemplified by a confocal reflectance micrograph which displays a bioengineered lubricant (in green) on the surface of articular cartilage. The collaboration began ten years ago, when Bonassar attended a presentation by one of Putnam's doctoral students. The student discussed new biomaterials that could prevent surgical adhesions. A specific synthetic polymer caught Bonassar's attention due to its striking resemblance to lubricin, a natural glycoprotein found in synovial joints. This discovery sparked the idea that the polymer, if modified, could serve as an effective lubricant for cartilage.\n\nFor nearly two decades, Bonassar has focused his research on the mechanics and repair of cartilage. He discovered that cartilage possesses the lowest coefficient of friction of any known material, even surpassing commonly slippery surfaces like ice or Teflon. It is still not fully understood why cartilage exhibits such exceptional lubrication properties.\n\nBonassar's laboratory has developed specialized instrumentation capable of measuring these minute friction coefficients and identifying the crucial molecular components responsible for cartilage's remarkable lubrication abilities. Lubricin and hyaluronic acid are the key elements forming a hydrophilic complex that attracts water to the tissue surface, providing lubrication. In cases of arthritis and traumatic injuries, this biopolymer layer is disrupted, resulting in decreased lubrication and increased stress on the tissue, damaging its cells.\n\nThrough their collaboration, Bonassar and Putnam successfully engineered a synthetic polymer that mimics the function of lubricin. Over the years, their team has expanded to include Paszek, an expert in glycoprotein engineering, and Reesink, who specializes in validating therapeutics using animal models. The unique skill sets of the team members have been instrumental in their ability to work effectively together, enhancing their research efforts.\n\nThe team hopes to develop injectable treatments for arthritis within the next five years. They also aim to generate compelling data from animal studies, demonstrating the potential for these lubricants to progress in the developmental process. Additionally, they plan to create general paradigms that can be applied to tailor lubricants for various medical applications. Biosynthetic lubricants have the potential to address a range of physical ailments, including dry eyes, skin abrasions, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain digestive and reproductive issues. Essentially, these lubricants can be applied to any mucosal layers that struggle to retain water on their surfaces.\n\nIn summary, the interdisciplinary research team is enthusiastic about their five-year, $2 million grant to develop biosynthetic lubricants. Their goal is to advance the treatment of arthritis and joint pain, while also expanding their research to address other medical applications. Their collaboration and unique skill sets allow them to optimize these lubricants and continually improve their efficacy."}]}

Between 2010 and 2018, the annual rate at which physicians left their practices saw a substantial increase of 43%, rising from 5.3% to 7.6% per year. While the exact causes of this trend remain unknown, the researchers emphasize the need for further investigation. Dr. Lawrence Casalino, a co-author of the study and Professor Emeritus of Population Health Sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, highlights the importance of studying turnover as it can disrupt the continuity and quality of patient care. The bond of trust between doctors and their patients, built over time, is challenging to replace.\n\nLed by Amelia Bond, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Economics in the Department of Population Health Sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, the study authors developed a novel method to estimate turnover. Primarily utilizing the Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty (MD-PPAS) database, which contains information on clinician characteristics, such as age, sex, physician specialty, and tax identification numbers of the practices in which physicians work. Through this data, the researchers created an algorithm that allowed them to estimate physician turnover from 2010 to the first three quarters of 2020.\n\nDr. Casalino believes this method may become the gold standard for identifying turnover in the future, as prior estimates based on surveys have proven unreliable. The findings of the study demonstrate a 43% increase in the annual turnover rate between 2010 and 2018, which is a substantial change. Most of the turnover occurred between 2010 and 2014 and resulted from doctors discontinuing their practice, with the reasons for this increase remaining unclear.\n\nFurthermore, turnover may present additional challenges in accessing care for those in rural areas and underserved communities. The researchers noted that doctors in rural areas were more likely to move or cease practicing compared to their urban counterparts. Female doctors also displayed a higher propensity for turnover than male doctors. Additionally, physicians in larger practices experienced higher turnover rates than those in smaller practices.\n\nThe researchers observed that doctors serving a larger number of Medicare and Medicaid-eligible patients were also more susceptible to turnover. Following 2014, turnover rates remained relatively stable until 2017, after which they slightly increased in 2018. It is worth noting that turnover rates, based on data about moving, were slightly lower in the second and third quarters of 2020 compared to the corresponding quarters in 2019. While it appears that the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in significant turnover, further analysis of the next year or two of data will provide a better understanding of any pandemic-related trends.\n\nIn addition to shedding light on COVID-19 physician turnover, this method will also enable the determination of turnover rates following the acquisition of a physician practice by private equity companies, health insurers, or hospitals. Dr. Casalino expresses that once the reasons behind doctor turnover are understood, individual practices or hospitals can develop effective retention programs. This is why the researchers are making their algorithm available to other researchers for use.\n\nOverall, this research presents a compelling case for the need to delve deeper into the factors contributing to doctor turnover. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of this issue, healthcare organizations can create targeted strategies to retain their providers, ensuring the provision of high-quality care and fostering enduring doctor-patient relationships."}]}

Today, Hinestroza and a team of chemists and engineers from Cornell University are applying their expertise to tackle another environmental challenge: polyester textile waste. Their innovative approach involves breaking down old polyester clothing and reusing its compounds to create fabrics with desirable properties such as fire resistance, anti-bacterial capabilities, and wrinkle resistance. Moreover, this approach helps to address the issue of garment waste accumulating in landfills. This circular approach aligns with the United Nations Environment Programme's initiative to combat overconsumption of clothing in developed countries. According to the program, the number of times clothing is worn has decreased by 36% in the past two decades. A 2015 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that each person in the United States discards more than 70 pounds of textiles annually, with over 85% of textile waste ending up in landfills.\n\nThe team at Cornell, led by Yelin Ko, a doctoral student in the field of fiber science and a Fulbright scholarship recipient, has developed a method to break down polyester fabrics into their monomers, which can then be used to create metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These MOFs can be applied as coatings on clothing to provide protection against germs and noxious gases, or to shield firefighters from fire hazards. The possibilities for future applications are vast. By leveraging this technology, the team aims to disrupt the unsustainable practices in the textile and apparel industry.\n\nThe process begins by adding sodium hydroxide solution to polyester fabrics in a flask, followed by agitation, applied heat, ethanol, and cooling water. The resulting solution, resembling a laboratory soup, allows the extraction of monomers. These monomers are then used to create linkers for assembling MOFs. The team has found that minor changes in the chemical structure of these MOFs can produce a wide range of colors.\n\nThe team acknowledges the challenge of plastic recycling and recognizes MOFs as a means to enable the recycling of polyester. However, they understand that for their technique to succeed, it must integrate seamlessly into existing industry practices. They hope that manufacturers will adopt MOF chemistry within their current infrastructure, as incorporating new equipment can be challenging and met with resistance.\n\nOverall, the team at Cornell University is enthusiastic about their research and its potential to revolutionize the textile and apparel industry. They believe that their approach can make a significant difference in reducing fabric waste and promoting sustainability."}]}

This research has prompted one major pollination company, Plant Products, to take immediate action in order to adapt the bumblebee hive boxes they ship to growers. The study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology in February, revealed that brightly colored commercial bumblebee nest boxes attract wild queens who may be looking to establish their own nests. Unfortunately, when these wild queens enter the commercial nest boxes, they are treated as intruders and subsequently killed by the workers. This behavior has led to the loss of wild hives and valuable pollinators in those areas.\n\nThe study also discovered that attaching a device known as an excluder to the nest box doorways was found to be 100% effective in preventing wild queens from entering the hives. In response to this research, Plant Products, a North American subsidiary of Biobest, has already provided excluders for the entrances and exits of all hives that it ships, along with operating instructions for the excluders. Furthermore, the company has made personal calls to every client to explain the purpose and usage of the excluders. By implementing this solution, Plant Products aims to safeguard the wild queens by making the doorway too small for them to enter while still allowing worker bees access.\n\nHeather Grab, Ph.D. and senior lecturer in the School of Integrative Plant Science at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, expressed the importance of addressing this behavior, stating, \"For every queen that we're losing because of this behavior, that's a whole colony of bumblebees that we're potentially losing that's providing really important pollination services later in the season.\" The study found that an average of approximately 10 queens per colony were being killed within the study region alone.\n\nIn addition to the threat posed to wild pollinators, the study also revealed that pollination services actually decreased at sites where commercial bumblebee colonies were used, compared to areas where they were not used. This decline is likely due to the loss of wild pollinators. Prior to the paper's publication, Scott McArt, Ph.D. and associate professor of pollinator health in the Department of Entomology at CALS, contacted Plant Products and Koppert, the only two North American commercial bumblebee suppliers, to inform them of the study's findings and propose the use of excluders as a simple and effective solution. By the time the paper was published in February, Plant Products had already taken the necessary steps to include excluders in all of its shipments. The company is also engaged in ongoing research and development to determine optimal strategies moving forward.\n\nMcArt commended the swift response of Biobest to the study's findings, stating, \"Frankly, I've been blown away by how quickly Biobest responded to the study's findings and implemented simple but effective companywide changes.\" The excluders were originally developed for a different purpose but have proved to be invaluable in addressing this issue. Commercial bumblebee nest boxes typically have two openings, one for entrance and one for exit. These openings can be closed to keep the bees inside during crop spraying or to facilitate hive relocation. The excluders were initially designed to cover the exit and prevent commercial hive queens from escaping, mating with wild bees, and potentially spreading disease. Now, Plant Products is utilizing the excluders on both the entrances to keep wild bees out.\n\nOverall, bumblebees have been experiencing population declines across North America. Therefore, rescuing queens early in the spring has the potential to mitigate some of these declines. Plant Products' proactive actions demonstrate their commitment to protecting and preserving wild pollinators."}]}

Established in 2022 by Cornell Cooperative Extension Monroe County (CCE Monroe), this half-acre farm serves as a workforce training and transitional jobs program for young adults aged 18 to 26 who face employment obstacles.\n\nMarci Muller, the horticulture program leader for CCE Monroe and a long-time advocate for at-risk young adults, expressed her enthusiasm for the program, stating, \"This is a population that lacks the same opportunities as others, and that's simply unfair. Our program aims to help them incorporate workday structure into their lives and develop crucial soft skills such as punctuality and teamwork. Once they are ready to hold onto a job, we assist them in finding employment.\"\n\nPart of CCE Monroe's South Lawn Project, the GROWS program (Gaining Relevant and Outstanding Work Skills) is currently in its second year. Each year, five young adults participate in the program, leading to a total of 15 employees working on the farm by the end of this growing season. These employees receive stipends for their hours worked. CCE Monroe collaborates with partnering nonprofits and agencies to address broader challenges faced by the workers, including housing and financial insecurity, inconsistent access to internet, childcare, and transportation.\n\nAside from gaining tangible skills in farm maintenance and crop cultivation, the farm employees begin to envision new career paths for themselves. Michael Kincaid, the urban agriculture educator at CCE Monroe and the farm manager for the South Lawn Project, along with Marci Muller, helped one current employee, Jordan Conyer, secure an additional part-time job and enroll in community college for the upcoming fall semester.\n\nThe farm, designed as an outdoor classroom, is situated on the south lawn of the CCE Monroe offices. In addition to the GROWS program, it serves as a platform for the community to learn about horticulture, urban farming, nutrition, and more. Currently, there are approximately 80 to 90 crop varieties being cultivated, and the harvested food is donated to food pantries in low-income neighborhoods. The first delivery, made in late June, consisted of 36 pounds of food.\n\nMarci Muller expressed her desire to expand the program's reach by establishing satellite gardens in the neighborhoods where the program participants reside. She believes that having a presence in those communities, with access to more funding and vacant lots, along with a mobile crew, would significantly benefit both the communities and the program. There is a growing movement to empower people to grow their own food, reclaim underutilized city properties, and enhance and beautify communities.\n\nSome of the program's current and past employees have discovered a newfound interest in horticulture as a potential career path. Walker, for instance, briefly left the program but was astounded by the remarkable transformation in the garden upon his return. Michael Kincaid noted that there are numerous moments where he and the employees experience a childlike curiosity, finding joy and surprise in their work. They recall delightful surprises such as weeds that smell like peanut butter, the black licorice flavor of fennel, and encounters with groundhogs and baby raccoons, which were promptly released.\n\nOverall, this program not only equips young adults with valuable skills but also fosters a sense of wonder and excitement about agriculture."}]}

Researchers at Cornell University and Google Research have developed an algorithm called DynIBAR that synthesizes new views using pixel information from the original video, even accommodating moving objects and unstable camerawork. This advancement surpasses previous efforts, which only produced a few seconds of video and often resulted in blurry or glitchy moving subjects. The code for this research is freely available, although it is not yet integrated into commercial video editing tools. Noah Snavely, a research scientist at Google Research and associate professor of computer science at Cornell Tech, expressed enthusiasm for the potential applications of this research in both personal and professional use. Snavely noted that while significant progress has been made in view synthesis methods, most of these methods struggle with scenes involving movement. Existing methods for rendering new views of still scenes, such as creating a 3D effect from a photo, reconstruct the appearance and shape of objects based on the 2D grid of pixels. DynIBAR goes further by estimating the movement of objects over time, presenting a complex mathematical problem. To simplify this problem, the researchers used image-based rendering, a computer graphics approach developed in the 1990s. This method allows for the alteration and recombination of parts from multiple images to generate new images, making it suitable for complex scenes and longer videos. However, despite the advancement, these features may not be available on smartphones in the near future due to the significant processing time required. The software currently takes several hours to process just a few seconds of video, even on powerful computers. In the short term, this technology may be more appropriate for use in offline video editing software. The next challenge will be finding a solution for rendering new images when pixel information is lacking, such as when the subject moves too quickly or the user wants to rotate the viewpoint. Snavely and Wang suggest incorporating generative AI techniques, such as text-to-image generators, to fill in these gaps. The research also involved contributions from Forrester Cole and Richard Tucker from Google Research."}]}

However, recent research conducted by Cornell University has shown that it can also be a valuable resource for enhancing predictive algorithms in the financial industry. In their recent publication, titled \"News-Based Sparse Machine Learning Models for Adaptive Asset Pricing,\" the researchers combine principles from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and finance to develop a new and interpretable machine learning framework. This framework effectively captures stock- and industry-specific information, resulting in more accurate predictions of financial returns compared to traditional models.\n\nLead author Liao Zhu, Ph.D. '20, who now works in the finance industry, explains that the research aims to bring order to the chaotic results often produced by algorithms. By \"clustering the data,\" the researchers provide valuable insight into the relationship between financial news and tradable assets. The authors propose that financial news can offer a deeper understanding of the stocks related to specific tradable assets.\n\nThis research builds upon earlier work by Zhu during his doctoral studies, supervised by Wells and Robert Jarrow, the Ronald P. & Susan E. Lynch Professor of Investment Management at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management. Co-author Peter (Haoxuan) Wu, Ph.D. '23, also contributes to this paper.\n\nWhile applying traditional statistical methods to market data and using sentiment analysis for text data are not new concepts, this research introduces a flexible prediction framework that seamlessly combines market and text data without relying on sentiment analysis. By utilizing interpretability and new machine learning algorithms, the researchers propose a more comprehensive approach.\n\nThe researchers incorporate the concept of \"word embeddings\" from natural language processing and utilize an algorithm to create \"asset embeddings\" for a specific set of tradable assets using financial news. By converting both text and market data into numerical values, the researchers employ custom-designed algorithms to analyze the data. Importantly, the algorithm does not rely on sentiment from the news, but rather utilizes the news as a guide to identify relevant assets and words for each specific stock or industry. This approach reveals valuable stock- and industry-specific information.\n\nTo develop their models, the researchers gathered a substantial corpus of online financial news articles from 2013 to 2019. This data was fed into their algorithm, which mapped particular assets and words associated with specific stocks and industries. By creating an AI-optimized language map, the researchers gained valuable insights into specific assets and words to consider.\n\nUsing this methodology, the team developed two separate models. The first model, named the News Embedding UMAP Sparse Selection (NEUSS) model, predicts returns for individual stocks. The second model, named the News Sparse Encoder with Rationale (INSER) model, identifies important words for each specific industry and utilizes them to predict industry returns with greater accuracy.\n\nFor instance, the NEUSS model may conclude from financial news articles that an exchange-traded fund tracking the semiconductor manufacturing sector is useful in predicting the stock returns of a specific tech company. However, it may not be applicable for predicting returns of other stocks in retail or wholesale sectors. Similarly, the INSER model may identify the word \"plant\" as important for the energy industry, but this word may not hold relevance for industries like social media.\n\nIn summary, this research highlights the potential of financial news as a valuable resource for enhancing predictive models in the financial industry. By bridging market data and text data without relying on sentiment analysis, the researchers have developed a comprehensive and interpretable machine learning framework. Their findings provide valuable insights into specific assets and industry-related words, resulting in more accurate predictions of financial returns."}]}

NFT transaction processing, which has seen a fourfold increase over the past five years, was previously energy-intensive but has become more sustainable with the adoption of a more efficient algorithm. However, the researchers believe that the anticipated surge in yearly NFT activity will offset these savings. Due to the lack of storage capability, excess renewable energy forces grid operators to curtail production. Our proposal aims to utilize this unused energy production potential effectively. It is similar to someone lending their unused car for carsharing. In this case, untapped wind, solar, and hydro power sources can be used for a beneficial purpose. However, the implementation of this idea would require the involvement of industry and policymakers. From a technological standpoint, it is highly feasible as these power sources already exist. Our key finding suggests that the increased processing activity of NFTs could be partly powered by un- or underutilized existing power sources. For example, fifty megawatts of potential hydropower from existing U.S. dams that are currently not generating power, or a 15% utilization of wind and solar energy in Texas that cannot be used or stored, could power a significant increase in NFT transactions. Blockchain technologies, including NFTs, offer a high level of security in various applications. However, the energy consumption associated with each transaction poses a problem in the context of climate change. Without sustainable efforts, the annual emissions caused by NFT transactions could reach the equivalent of 0.37 megatons of carbon dioxide, similar to the CO2 emissions from 1 million single-trip flights from New York to London. In September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain responded to the need for more sustainable trading by transitioning from an energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) algorithm to a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, resulting in reduced energy consumption. Nonetheless, the authors caution that an exponential rise in recorded NFT transactions would lead to more validators operating on the network. By the end of this decade, the energy consumed by such transactions could be equivalent to that of 100,000 U.S. households. Despite the lower energy consumption per individual transaction, the cumulative effect of increased validators operating on fossil fuel-dominant grids will contribute to a further rise in associated carbon emissions. By the end of this decade, the carbon footprint generated by NFT transactions could be comparable to that of a 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant in a year. The authors also evaluated the viability of two hydroelectric energy carriers, green hydrogen and green ammonia (which is more energy-dense than hydrogen), highlighting that their cost savings depend on factors such as transportation distances and utilization levels of renewable energy sources. Retrofitting these existing power sources may pose challenges, but it would be beneficial for both energy carriers and the environment. \"NFT processing is highly energy-intensive, so using these curtailments is a favorable approach,\" mentioned one of the researchers.

Researchers have found that by using a probabilistic finite automaton, a well-known model with limited computational power, they were able to simulate human behaviors. These automatons were programmed to compete in a wildlife poaching game as either a rhino poacher or a ranger trying to stop the poaching.\n\nWhen the automatons had the ability to remember everything, they settled into an optimal game strategy. However, when their memories were limited, they took shortcuts in decision-making, similar to actual humans playing the game. This research supports the concept of bounded rationality, suggesting that we sometimes make mistakes not because we are irrational, but because we have limited resources.\n\nThe first author, Xinming Liu '20, explains, \"Often, we cannot remember everything or we don't have enough time to make fully rational decisions.\" This work, titled \"Strategic Play by Resource-Bounded Agents in Security Games,\" was presented by Liu at the 2023 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. The senior author, Joseph Halpern, is a professor of computer science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science.\n\nIn the poaching game, there are different sites with varying probabilities of containing a rhino. In each round, the poacher and ranger choose a site to visit based on data from previous rounds. The poacher gains points by catching a rhino, while the ranger gains points by catching the poacher. Automatons and humans alike showed similar strategies in the game, focusing on visiting sites with a higher likelihood of encountering a rhino.\n\nAnother interesting finding was that both automatons and humans exhibited the behavior of overweighting significant results. This means that important or traumatic incidents had a greater impact on decision-making. For example, a person might drive slowly down a road where they received a speeding ticket years ago. When the poachers were programmed to overweight previous encounters with the ranger, it proved advantageous in the game as they avoided high-risk sites.\n\nTo compare these results with actual humans, Liu recruited around 100 participants to play as the poacher on an online platform. Some participants chose the same site repeatedly or picked randomly just to finish the game and receive payment. Others used probability matching, while a third group assumed the ranger was probability matching and adjusted their site choices accordingly.\n\nThe similarities in gameplay between humans and automatons demonstrate that the model successfully replicates human behaviors that improve performance. Rather than being irrational, these behaviors can be seen as individuals doing their best given their computational limitations. As Halpern concludes, \"You're doing the best you can within your limitations, and that strikes me as pretty rational.\""}]}

The research was led by postdoctoral researcher Qiangqiang Gu, alongside Joe Carroll of University College Cork and Shuqiu Wang of Oxford University.\n\nTopological superconductors, which have the potential to serve as the foundation for highly stable quantum computers, are of great interest to physicists. However, identifying bulk materials that exhibit the required characteristics has proven challenging. UTE2 has emerged as a promising candidate, but its superconductive order parameter has remained elusive. Theoretical physicists proposed in 2021 that UTE2 may actually exist in a topological pair-density-wave (PDW) state, a form of quantum matter that had never been detected before.\n\nIn simple terms, a PDW can be visualized as a stationary dance of paired electrons within a superconductor, with the pairs forming regular crystalline patterns in space. Cornell's team previously discovered the first PDW in 2016 using their own invention, the superconductive-tip scanned Josephson tunnelling microscope. For the UTE2 project, they directly visualized the spatial modulations of the superconducting pairing potential at the atomic scale and confirmed that they aligned with the predicted PDW state.\n\nThis groundbreaking discovery showcases a new quantum matter state, specifically a topological pair density wave composed of spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Cooper-pair density waves represent a distinct electronic quantum matter state in which pairs of electrons freeze into a superconductive PDW state, rather than forming a conventional freely moving fluid state. Gu emphasizes the significance of this finding, stating that it is the first PDW observed in spin-triplet superconductors. Uranium-based heavy fermion superconducting compounds, like UTE2, offer an exciting platform for the realization of topological superconductivity.\n\nFurthermore, this discovery suggests that PDW states may be more widespread than previously thought, existing in a range of superconductors with different symmetry types. It opens up new possibilities for identifying such states in various materials."}]}

This valuable insight provides potential indications of deployment patterns. The study revealed trends in police presence based on factors such as time of day, neighborhood demographics, proximity to police stations, and commercial districts.\n\nOne notable finding was that Gramercy Park in Midtown Manhattan had the highest number of police vehicles visible in dashcam images, nearly 20 times more than Arden Heights/Rossville in Southern Staten Island, which had the fewest. Notably, areas with higher numbers of police vehicle images included both affluent commercial zones and low-income neighborhoods with larger populations of Black and Latino residents.\n\nThe senior authors of this study are Wendy Ju, Associate Professor of Information Science at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech, and Emma Pierson, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech. Both authors are field members in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science.\n\nWhile data on police stops, use of force, searches, criminal incidents, and arrests is publicly available, information regarding officer deployment is generally not provided by police departments due to security concerns. The researchers noted that deployment disparities can lead to downstream biases, such as increased arrests. It is important to note that a neighborhood with a heavier police presence may not necessarily experience higher crime rates, but rather a higher number of arrests.\n\nIn 2020, the research team, which included J.D. Zamfirescu-Pereira, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, obtained 24.8 million dashcam images from Nexar, a company that offers dashboard cameras to rideshare drivers. Companies like Uber, for instance, recommend installing cameras for driver protection. Nexar made their proprietary images, taken between March 4, 2020, and November 15, 2020, available for research purposes. Initially, the Cornell team used these images to gather information on social distancing practices in New York City during the pandemic. Subsequently, they utilized thousands of annotated images to train a deep learning model in identifying marked police vehicles. It is important to note that the model could identify police vehicles but could not determine the reasons behind their presence.\n\nThe researchers identified over 233,000 images containing marked police vehicles. These pictures were taken across all five boroughs of New York City at various times of the day. The team then analyzed the geo-tagged images in relation to specific factors such as neighborhood, borough, and zone type, as well as whether the images were taken in busy commercial areas, manufacturing areas, or primary residential locations. Additionally, the researchers examined census data for each area, including population density, median household income, and racial demographics (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian).\n\nThe researchers believe that this work offers two significant benefits: it is a step towards increased transparency in policing and has the potential to facilitate audits of all government agencies for efficiency and equity. Wendy Ju emphasized that this method of training a model to identify objects, such as garbage piles, using computer vision can be applied in various ways to assist city governments and urban planners. The adaptability of this method in detecting a wide range of phenomena, including marked police vehicles, is particularly exciting.\n\nThis research received support from an Amazon Research Award, a Google Research Scholar Award, and the National Science Foundation."}]}

This grant aims to address cancer disparities caused by persistent poverty. Our collaborative effort will involve faculty members from Weill Cornell Medicine, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University School of Nursing, and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University.\n\nWith this funding, we will establish a specialized research center and lead two major projects in four communities of persistent poverty in New York City. The NCI sought to support centers that propose innovative ways to bridge health equity gaps, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this important work. While we cannot eliminate persistent poverty, we can certainly mitigate its impact on cancer outcomes.\n\nThe overall center will be led by a team of principal investigators, including Dr. Erica Phillips from Weill Cornell Medicine, Mary Beth Terry, and Phoenix Matthews from Columbia. This initiative builds upon our existing collaborations between Columbia and Weill Cornell Medicine in public health initiatives to reduce the cancer burden. It is particularly crucial as cancer remains the leading cause of premature mortality in New York City.\n\nWeill Cornell Medicine's Center for Social Capital (SoCA) will utilize this grant to undertake two complementary projects. These projects will focus on promoting multi-generational cancer awareness and health in South Bronx, North-Central Brooklyn, Washington Heights, and Western Queens, working closely with community partners.\n\nThe first project, led by Dr. Phillips, will evaluate the effectiveness of a six-week cancer education and social justice curriculum among middle school students in 10 New York City public schools. The curriculum will cover various aspects of cancer prevention and control, including social justice, media literacy, tobacco advertising, nutrition, cancer genetics, biotechnology, and risk reduction. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Columbia investigators and the national nonprofit Math for America, which aims to enhance STEM instruction in NYC public schools.\n\nDr. Phillips added that poverty is often multi-generational and linked to unemployment. By increasing exposure to STEM-based careers, this project also aims to enhance the future employment prospects and leadership potential of these students.\n\nThe second project, led by Dr. Matthews from Columbia's School of Nursing, will implement an innovative tobacco cessation trial using federally qualified health centers and patient portal technology. The team will work directly with safety-net healthcare clinics to raise patient awareness about free smoking cessation treatments offered by the New York State Tobacco Quitline. Through an established patient portal, investigators will communicate directly with patients regarding changes they make to their smoking behaviors.\n\nAddressing smoking-related health inequalities among economically disadvantaged patients remains a critical public health priority. Low-income patients face numerous barriers to accessing affordable and effective smoking cessation treatments. Our approach seeks to equip safety-net clinics with the capacity to support providers in delivering evidence-based smoking cessation counseling, while minimizing costs and provider burden.\n\nIn addition to these projects, our team will develop a capacity-building program that accelerates the research funding and academic promotion of pre-faculty investigators committed to addressing cancer health disparities in impoverished communities. This program aims to empower and strengthen their position within the academic community.\n\nWe are honored to have received this grant from the NCI and are excited to embark on this transformative journey towards combating cancer disparities fueled by poverty. Together, we can make a significant impact on the lives of those affected by cancer in our community."}]}

The formation, growth, and evolution of Earth's inner core have remained a mystery, but a team of researchers is determined to unravel its secrets using seismic waves generated by natural earthquakes.\n\nDespite comprising less than 1% of Earth's total volume, this 2,442-kilometer-diameter sphere holds significant importance. It is responsible for Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for maintaining our planet's current conditions. Contrary to previous assumptions, the inner core is not a homogeneous mass but rather a complex network of different materials. This groundbreaking discovery was made by Guanning Pang, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Engineering, who recently published a study in Nature.\n\nMapping and understanding Earth's surface have been extensively studied, but exploring its interior poses a more significant challenge due to limited accessibility. Earthquakes' seismic waves offer valuable insights into this hidden realm. These waves travel through Earth's thin crust, rocky mantle, and metallic core, providing scientists with an opportunity to study its composition.\n\nThe process of Earth's formation involved the accretion of asteroids in space, resulting in the generation of substantial energy. As the planet formed, the heavier iron sank to the middle, forming the core, while the liquid rock surrounded it. Over time, this molten metal cooled, creating the solid inner core. The planet's protective magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid outer core, which extends 2,260 kilometers above the solid core.\n\nIn their study, Pang and their colleague, Koper, analyzed seismic data recorded by 20 arrays of seismometers placed worldwide. These instruments were inserted into boreholes drilled into granite formations, allowing for concentrated signal reception. By examining seismic waves from over 2,455 earthquakes, the researchers were able to map the internal structure of the inner core.\n\nThe discovery of Earth's solid inner core was first made in 1936, challenging the previous belief that the core was entirely liquid due to its extreme temperatures, comparable to the surface of the sun.

The study found that female applicants for scholarships or jobs were viewed less favorably than males when decision-makers were shown \"sexy\" social media photos of the applicants. This highlights a \"sexual double standard\" rooted in traditional gender norms that perceive men's sexual assertiveness as a sign of strength, while women exhibiting the same behavior are seen negatively.\n\nThis research raises concerns for young people, particularly those in college or just entering the job market, who are managing both their professional and social outcomes. While social media is often used to communicate with friends, it is important to consider the potential negative effects these posts may have on other domains, such as academic and professional success.\n\nThe study also revealed that women are more likely than men to post photos on social media. While this may be a way for women to seek validation, there is also a potential penalty associated with this behavior. With over 4 billion people on social media, recruiters and hiring managers are increasingly using these platforms to gather information about prospective candidates. In fact, a national survey conducted in 2018 found that 70% of recruiters used social media sites to research job candidates, and more than half of them discovered content that led them to decide not to hire someone.\n\nThe researchers conducted four separate experiments to explore this phenomenon. Two experiments involved college-age participants acting as decision-makers for scholarship recipients, while the other two experiments involved older professionals with hiring experience acting as job recruiters. In all four experiments, participants were shown photos of candidates in both semi-professional and sexualized attire. The results consistently showed that the female candidates received more favorable evaluations in the semi-professional images but were less preferred in the sexualized images.\n\nThese findings emphasize the importance of considering how one's social media presence may impact professional opportunities. It is crucial to be mindful of the content shared online, as potential employers and others who can influence professional lives are increasingly relying on social media to learn about candidates. This research sheds light on the need to challenge societal norms and biases that contribute to the sexual double standard identified in the study.\n\nThis work was supported by Cornell University and the National Science Foundation."}]}

They have found the first evidence of gravitational waves, which are ripples in space-time likely caused by merging pairs of supermassive black holes. Previously, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center had hinted at the existence of low-frequency waves predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, but the signal was too faint to confirm. However, in a recent publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, the team of nearly 200 scientists and 80 partner institutions announced compelling evidence of gravitational waves with oscillations lasting years to decades. These findings are a result of observations made with radio telescopes and a collection of rapidly spinning pulsars, known as cosmic clocks.\n\nThe Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, which tragically collapsed in 2020, was instrumental in NANOGrav's gravitational wave sensitivity, accounting for about half of it. These detections and ongoing measurements are expected to enhance our understanding of the universe's evolution on both large and small scales. Experts at Cornell believe that they will provide insights into how frequently galaxies collide, what drives black hole mergers, and even the fundamental nature of gravity itself.\n\nIt is important to note that the newly detected gravitational waves differ from the high-frequency ones detected in 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The high-frequency waves were generated by the collision of black holes that were 30 times more massive than the sun. In contrast, the low-frequency waves are believed to be a result of orbiting pairs of the universe's most massive black holes, which are millions or billions of times more massive than the sun and have sizes larger than the distance between the Earth and the sun.\n\nSupported by the National Science Foundation, NANOGrav collected data using various observatories, including the Arecibo Observatory, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. These ground-based observatories measured pulses of radio waves emitted by a network of 68 pulsars located within a few thousand light years of Earth. Millisecond pulsars, which are ultra-dense remnants of massive stars, spin hundreds of times per second and emit highly precise beams of radio waves, similar to a lighthouse beacon.\n\nNANOGrav's pulsar timing working group, led by Thankful Cromartie, a NASA Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow at CCAPS, played a significant role in producing the 15-year data set. Cromartie highlights the importance of millisecond pulsars, not just as exciting astrophysical objects but also as valuable tools for studying various physics phenomena, including gravitational waves and supranuclear-density matter in neutron star cores. The ability to measure pulses from an object rotating hundreds of times per second with atomic-clock precision is truly remarkable.\n\nThanks to 15 years of pulsar observations, the NANOGrav collaboration has discovered evidence of low-frequency gravitational waves throughout the cosmos. These waves cause the space between the pulsars and Earth to stretch and compress, resulting in slight variations in the arrival time of the beams at telescopes. The researchers have observed correlations in timing deviations between pulsars consistent with predicted gravitational waves. Although the waves do not originate from a single source, they have been detected as a background \"hum,\" similar to overlapping voices in a crowd or instruments in an orchestra. As measurements continue to improve, the project expects to identify individual pairs of supermassive black holes for further investigation, akin to picking out notes from a cosmic orchestra.\n\nWhile this announcement marks a significant milestone, Professor Cordes emphasizes that it is just the beginning of what is to come. The ongoing work of NANOGrav holds great promise for further discoveries and advancements in our understanding of the universe. Some of the Cornell researchers involved in NANOGrav include Stella Ocker, a Ph.D. candidate, and Sasha Baw Niedbalski, a doctoral student in the field of astronomy, along with several former undergraduate, doctoral, and postdoctoral researchers."}]}

Recognizing the demand from enterprise retailers for access to these innovations, we have made our technology available to the largest brands globally. We already power well-known names such as Glossier, Alo Yoga, Figs, and Staples. Earlier this year, we introduced Commerce Components by Shopify, enabling more enterprise retailers to utilize the same components that support 10% of ecommerce in the U.S. By leveraging Shopify, these retailers can stay at the forefront of industry trends by harnessing our unparalleled scale and choosing the components they need to create exceptional customer experiences.\n\nIn response to the strong demand from enterprise retailers who have witnessed the success and scale of the Shop Pay buyer network, we are opening access to our accelerated checkout feature to even the biggest brands, regardless of whether they are on Shopify or not. By transforming Shop Pay into a commerce component, we are empowering enterprise customers to enhance their customer experience without the need to completely revamp their commerce infrastructure. For enterprises based in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, this means easy access to a reliable accelerated checkout system, utilized by over 100 million highly engaged and valuable buyers. Available through Shopify Payments, Shop Pay has been proven to increase conversion rates by up to 50% compared to guest checkouts, surpassing all other accelerated checkout options by at least 10%, as verified by a recent study from a leading consulting firm. Moreover, the data reveals that the mere presence of Shop Pay, even if not used by a buyer, results in a 5% higher conversion rate.\n\nKaz Nejatian, VP Product and Chief Operating Officer of Shopify, states, \"Enterprises that fail to take advantage of Shop Pay are hindering their own success and leaving potential revenue on the table. In this fiercely competitive retail landscape, this optionality is crucial. In an economy where big brands are vying intensely for customer acquisition, they need the ability to select and implement the tools necessary to boost their top line without the need for a complete platform overhaul.\"\n\nSo, what makes Shop Pay so powerful? We have been able to develop the world's most effective checkout process thanks to four key advantages: Shopify's extensive identity network, unmatched scalability, consumer trust, and rapid pace of innovation. When a customer with a Shop Pay account visits an online store, Shopify can instantly recognize them with just one click. If they have recently used Shop Pay, our checkout automatically identifies most customers without requiring any user action. This enables Shop Pay to pre-fill all relevant information, resulting in a seamless one-click checkout experience that is four times faster than a guest checkout.\n\nWe understand that different businesses have distinct payment requirements, and that's why Shopify currently offers over 1,000 payment gateways. One of our long-standing gateways is Adyen, and we are now taking our integration to the next level specifically for enterprise retailers. Adyen simplifies the acceptance of various payment methods in markets worldwide, including credit cards, popular digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, international payment methods such as iDEAL in the Netherlands and Cartes Bancaires in France, and many more. This enhanced integration is scheduled to be rolled out later this year."}]}

While there are several consequences that come with this decision, we are excited about the opportunities it will bring. As a result of these changes, Shopify will be reducing its size by approximately 20%, and Flexport will be acquiring Shopify Logistics. We understand that this decision will impact some of you, and we want to assure you that it was not made lightly. In the next five minutes, you will receive a follow-up communication to let you know if you are affected.\n\nWe recognize the immense impact this news has on individuals, and we have designed a comprehensive package to support you during this transition. Although we cannot turn this into good news, we have created the best possible version of a difficult day. Details on the support we will provide can be found below.\n\nAt Shopify, we often refer to our main quests and side quests internally. Our main quest is our mission, the driving force behind our company's existence. Side quests, on the other hand, encompass everything else and can be distracting as they divert our focus. While engaging in side quests can sometimes be beneficial, allowing the main quest to flourish, larger companies often become burdened by these distractions. This is not due to their size, but rather the accumulation of side quests over time. Larger companies can afford to be inefficient during stable economic times, but when they need to adapt to new paradigms, they often struggle and face competition from more focused competitors.\n\nOver the past year, we have been removing any obstacles that hinder our ability to create the best possible product. This is crucial as we enter a decade of rapid change and high velocity. To thrive in this environment, we must prioritize speed, agility, and innovation. Shopify's main quest is to simplify, democratize, and make commerce more accessible to all. We firmly believe that we have built the world's best commerce platform to achieve this. However, with the rise of artificial intelligence, we now have the opportunity to unlock unprecedented capabilities. Shopify is privileged to be among the companies with the greatest potential to utilize AI to assist our customers. We can now envision a copilot for entrepreneurship. Our main quest now requires us to build the best solution that is currently possible, and this has completely transformed our approach.\n\nFor those who will be leaving Shopify today, we understand that everyone will process this news in their own way, and it will be challenging for all those affected. We want to assure you that we have a comprehensive severance package in place. This package includes a minimum of 16 weeks of severance pay, with an additional week for each year of tenure at Shopify. Furthermore, your medical benefits and access to our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will be covered during this period. If desired, we will also provide outplacement services, and you are welcome to keep any office furniture we have provided. While we legally require the return of your work laptop, we are happy to contribute towards the purchase of a new one. Additionally, you will have continued free access to the advanced Shopify plan should you decide to pursue an entrepreneurial path in the future. You will have an opportunity to discuss these details further during your meeting with a leader later today. \n\nThroughout this process, we will keep Slack and internal email open, allowing everyone to share farewell messages. I want to express my sincere gratitude to each and every one of you for your contributions to Shopify and our merchants."}]}

Particularly for enterprise businesses with extensive product inventories, having a reliable and efficient search function is not just a luxury but a necessity. In light of this, we are thrilled to announce our expanded partnership with Google to introduce Google Cloud's search and discovery tooling to enterprise brands using Shopify's commerce components.\n\nThrough this collaboration, the largest brands in the world will now have access to Discovery AI solutions, seamlessly integrated with their online stores via Shopify's commerce components. Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify, states, \"Our partnership with Google Cloud combines the best of commerce and search, creating a tremendous opportunity for brands.\" Finkelstein further adds, \"We recognize that a store's search is the primary way consumers shop, yet only a small percentage receive consistently accurate search results. This presents an immense challenge that we are excited to address through our ongoing work with Google.\"\n\nGoogle Cloud's Discovery AI solutions encompass various capabilities. Firstly, Retail Search provides advanced comprehension and more precise results, even for extensive queries, including non-product and semantic searches. This ensures swift and relevant product discovery by effectively matching product attributes with store content. Additionally, AI-powered personalization optimizes product display and ordering by leveraging consumer behavior patterns, such as clicks, cart additions, purchases, and other information, to determine individual preferences.\n\nThomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, emphasizes that \"Google Cloud's integration with Shopify empowers brands to swiftly harness the power of AI.\" By simplifying the implementation of exceptional product discovery experiences, shoppers can now find precisely what they desire in less time.\n\nRainbow Shops, an apparel brand with a widespread presence across the US and an extensive product range, is one of the first Shopify retailers to benefit from this integration. David Cost, Vice President of Ecommerce and Marketing at Rainbow Shops, attests to the positive outcomes, stating, \"For a retailer of our size, working with a commerce platform that offers agility and flexibility across all aspects of our business is crucial. Thanks to Shopify and their partnership with Google Cloud, we seamlessly integrated Google-quality search directly into our online store, resulting in a 48% increase in search volume.\"\n\nCommerce Components by Shopify, a modern and adaptable stack for enterprise retail, was launched earlier this year. Notable existing enterprise retailers on Shopify include renowned brands such as Mattel, Glossier, JB Hi-Fi, Coty, Steve Madden, Spanx, and Staples.\n\nFor more information about Commerce Components by Shopify, please visit our website.

Women play a vital role in driving economies around the world, and at Shopify, 53% of our global entrepreneurs are women. It is inspiring to see that there are now over 413 million women entrepreneurs worldwide, despite the historical barriers they have faced.\n\nWhile it is true that women still face challenges in raising venture capital and wage inequality persists, data shows that businesses led by women generate higher returns on investment than those led by men. Shopify actively supports women-led businesses every month, and we are proud to introduce you to three remarkable companies led by women who are dedicated to driving positive change in their industries and beyond.\n\nOne of these incredible entrepreneurs is Sandra Velasquez, who launched Nopalera, a beauty brand that celebrates her Mexican heritage, in 2020. Today, Nopalera products can be found on the shelves of major retailers such as Credo Beauty, Nordstrom, and Free People. Velasquez's vision was to disrupt the historically Euro-centric beauty space and highlight the richness and beauty of her culture. Raised in California as the daughter of Mexican immigrants, Velasquez found inspiration in the nopales cacti that lined her hometown streets. After a successful career in music and sales, she took a leap of faith and pursued her dream of creating her own brand. Velasquez's dedication and passion have led to the growth and success of Nopalera, and she hopes to inspire future Latina entrepreneurs to follow in her footsteps.\n\nAnother remarkable entrepreneur we want to showcase is Kathryn Shah, who drew inspiration from her travels across the Middle East and India. She noticed how these cultures presented fruit, nuts, and dates as luxurious and indulgent treats, a contrast to the bulk bins found in the US. When Shah was diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age, she realized the importance of healthy and wholesome foods. Motivated by her own experience, she set out to create delicious and nutritious treats. Shah's company, which now offers six bars of date-sweetened chocolate, continues to experiment with new recipes, using leftover ingredients to create additional products such as muesli. Her commitment to providing delicious and healthy alternatives has gained recognition and popularity.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the extraordinary women entrepreneurs making a difference in their industries and beyond. Shopify is proud to support and champion women-led businesses, not only during Women's History Month but every month. We look forward to cheering on these inspiring women as they continue to transform their corners of the world."}]}

Over the past decade, the Shopify partner program has grown into the largest commerce ecosystem globally, providing valuable support to merchants in their growth journey. As Shopify enters its next phase of expansion, it is introducing the first phase of a multi-year engagement in the partner program. The enhancements focus on three key areas: exceptional rewards, skills development, and a simplified, engaging partner experience.\n\nTo make it easier for partners to build their businesses, Shopify is significantly expanding program incentives. Partners now have the opportunity to earn double or more in 2023 through revenue share and promotions from referrals, allowing them to reinvest in their own growth. Additionally, Shopify is committed to helping partners close more deals through joint marketing and co-selling initiatives.\n\nThe investment Shopify is making in its partner program provides immediate opportunities for partners to grow their businesses. The partnership team prioritizes long-term, mutually beneficial relationships and values partner feedback. The new rewards and incentives demonstrate Shopify's responsiveness to the voice of its partners, as noted by Mary Krause, Strategic Alliances Manager at CQL.\n\nThe partner program investments exemplify Shopify's innovation and strength as a platform, according to Isaac Newton, Co-Founder of Pattern. The transformation of the partner program, especially the increased earning potential, will fuel growth and support customers' goals.\n\nTo ensure partners can effectively bring Shopify's innovations to their clients, Shopify is launching its first-ever certification program for partners. This program includes both business foundation and technical certifications, along with specialization badges that demonstrate product expertise. Partners will also have access to an expanded resource library and live webinars to support their growth.\n\nShopify is reimagining how partners engage with the platform and build relationships within the ecosystem. Education and earnings potential are being prioritized through expanded virtual and in-person events, starting with Partner Education Day on April 4th. Additionally, an in-person event in the fall will recognize and celebrate top-performing commercial partners.\n\nShopify's continued innovation in the program has played a crucial role in the success of many companies, such as We Make Websites. The program's readiness for enterprise-scale commerce has enabled agencies to build exceptional websites for top brands. Like Shopify, We Make Websites is committed to constant iteration and welcomes the updates to rewards, education, and networking.\n\nAt Imag/nary, they invest in iconic brands and the technology solutions that empower them. They have had a positive experience working alongside Shopify in building out the partner program. Shopify's team has consistently gone above and beyond to provide the necessary resources and attention for their portfolio companies to scale successfully. Imag/nary is excited to see Shopify evolve the program and further invest in the partner experience.\n\nThe evolving consumer expectations, rapid commerce innovation, and changing economic landscape greatly increase the value that Shopify partners bring to merchants.

The study reveals that 81% of black entrepreneurs acknowledge the need to overcome the obstacles of racism and stigma to succeed. Additionally, 61% of them find difficulty in obtaining access to capital, while 83% believe that now is their time to shine despite systemic barriers.\n\nAt Shopify, we understand the importance of a diverse range of voices in commerce, benefiting both businesses and consumers. However, we acknowledge that current commerce systems are not equitable for all. Imagine the potential for generational wealth creation and transformation if businesses had the necessary resources to thrive without barriers. Our quest at Shopify involves raising awareness about the impact of inequity on entrepreneurship.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the barriers faced by black-owned businesses, we recently conducted a survey and interviews with over 500 aspiring and established black entrepreneurs across North America. The results of this research study, titled \"In Pursuit of Equitable Commerce: Insights on Black Entrepreneurship in 2023 and Beyond,\" have been published.\n\nOne crucial finding is the critical importance of access to capital on favorable terms. While public support for black businesses has increased due to racial and social justice movements, securing capital remains a significant challenge for 61% of black entrepreneurs. Even accessing grants specifically meant for black businesses proves challenging for nearly 60% of them. Many resort to unfavorable finance options, such as personal savings, costly credit cards, and hard-to-access grants, to sustain their businesses. Easier access to financing and better terms for capital emerged as top priorities for their success.\n\nThe economic cost of inequity is substantial, amounting to billions of dollars. By providing more financial resources and mentorship to black entrepreneurs, we can unlock new selling opportunities and boost the economy by an estimated $190 billion. Shopify's data also reveals that 78% of black business owners struggle to attract customers who are not black. Empowering them with access to digital platforms and service providers would expand their advertising reach.\n\nIn line with our commitment to equity, Shopify has partnered with nonprofit organization Operation HOPE to establish one million new black-owned businesses (1MBB) by 2030. Black entrepreneurs demonstrate their determination and resilience by working harder and smarter to overcome the challenges they face. Despite knowing they are operating on an uneven playing field, 83% of black entrepreneurs believe that now is their time to shine. Furthermore, 68% feel optimistic about their business growth potential.\n\nAt Shopify, we firmly believe in making entrepreneurship more inclusive for everyone while injecting billions into the economy.

Even if we were to completely halt emissions right now, the amount of carbon already present in the atmosphere is still too high. It is clear that no single solution can solve this problem alone. When it comes to scaling carbon removal technologies, there is much more work to be done.\n\nSince the launch of our sustainability fund in 2019, Shopify has been actively investing in carbon removal, aiming to support and develop an emerging industry. Today, we are thrilled to announce that, in collaboration with Stripe, we are purchasing $11 million worth of carbon removal from six new companies: Arbor, Captura, Carbon to Stone, Cella, Crew, and Inplanet. This is an exciting development in our ongoing efforts to reverse climate change. We are truly inspired by the caliber and speed at which new companies are entering the market.\n\nThrough these purchases, we are providing these six new companies with the opportunity to demonstrate their impact and scale their operations. With the addition of these partners, Shopify has now backed a total of 28 companies in this endeavor. This investment is just one aspect of the significant work Shopify has undertaken this year to accelerate the growth of the carbon removal market.\n\nIn 2022, Shopify's sustainability fund expanded its portfolio by adding nine new businesses. Our investments have helped these companies bring their innovative solutions to market and increase the adoption of their offerings. Through our fund activities, we have also played a crucial role in helping multiple companies raise over $50 million in capital and expand their workforce by more than fivefold. This growth has enabled them to increase their carbon removal capacity by over 1000 times.\n\nFurthermore, in partnership with Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability, we launched Frontier, an advance market commitment (AMC). As the founders of Frontier, we have committed to investing a combined total of $925 million in carbon removal by the end of 2030. This commitment serves as a signal to innovators, investors, and project developers that there is a viable market for carbon removal and that we must all work together to scale the industry.\n\nIn June, we introduced Planet, an app designed specifically for Shopify merchants to offset their shipping emissions. Planet calculates the estimated shipping emissions for each order, and merchants can then fund the same carbon removal companies supported by Shopify to neutralize these emissions. Since its launch, more than 8,000 Shopify merchants have utilized Planet to offset the shipping emissions of over six million orders, resulting in a total carbon removal of over 5,000 tonnes. Merchants can easily install Planet from the Shopify app store.\n\nLastly, we published \"Buying Carbon Removal, Explained,\" a comprehensive guide for individuals and organizations seeking to support carbon removal but facing challenges along the way. This guide covers everything from researching suppliers to negotiating carbon removal contracts, and provides advice on how to address concerns from finance teams. Our commitment is to generate demand for carbon removal, empower new companies to prove their impact and scale, and invest millions every year to drive down future prices.\n\nI had the privilege of speaking about these initiatives at the TED Countdown London session, and you can watch the talk at go.ted.com/stacykauk. This concludes our update for now. Please subscribe to our mailing list for further updates from us in 2023. We have many more exciting plans for the new year as our work continues."}]}

The survey revealed that shoppers are now seeking products that have a longer lifespan, while businesses are aiming to connect with customers through various channels. Climate-conscious shopping is also gaining popularity on a large scale, and brand loyalty is up for grabs.\n\nGiven the changing economic landscape, commerce is taking on a new form. It is transitioning from a focus on high volume and low prices to a focus on lasting value. As we prepare for the 2022 Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend, which saw over 47 million shoppers purchasing from independent brands powered by Shopify last year, we conducted a survey involving more than 24,000 consumers and 9,000 small and medium businesses worldwide. Our goal was to understand how the rising cost of living is influencing spending habits and retail globally.\n\nThe feedback we received was clear and resounding. Both businesses and shoppers intend to be more deliberate, conscious, and connected this holiday shopping season. We can expect more intentional spending, with an increased number of climate-conscious shoppers seeking out brands that prioritize sustainability. Additionally, businesses are planning for a significant BFCM weekend by selling their products across multiple platforms, including social media, in-store, and everywhere in between.\n\nAccording to Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify, Black Friday Cyber Monday is not just a weekend; it is a season. It is undoubtedly the most significant commerce event of the year. Finkelstein emphasizes that modern retailers need to sell wherever their customers spend time, whether it be online, offline, or anywhere else. Building a community and establishing a direct relationship with customers will also secure their loyalty. Consumers are actively supporting the brands they love, which align with their values.\n\nThis year, consumers are prioritizing quality over quantity. Our survey found that 76% of consumers want to invest in higher-quality products that will endure. Although 75% of consumers have reduced their spending in recent months, more than half (57%) stated that they plan to spend the same amount or more on BFCM compared to last year. This is a significant indication for businesses, as our data suggests that 75% of them plan to offer better deals during the BFCM weekend.\n\nNicholas Dellaportas, founder of Taylor Morris Eyewear in the UK, highlighted the importance of tailoring offers to suit customers' budgets. Dellaportas emphasized the exploration of budget-friendly options, such as offering prescription glasses on subscription or providing additional support services. By adapting existing lenses instead of customers purchasing new ones when their prescription changes, Taylor Morris Eyewear aims to make luxury eyewear more accessible.\n\nIn light of this year's financial constraints, consumers are cautious with their spending. The majority (84%) of shoppers in our survey indicated that they compare prices before making a purchase. Millennials, in particular, are keen bargain hunters, with 77% stating that they are more likely to shop sales to maximize their money. Additionally, 65% of Gen Z consumers plan to save more money this year in preparation for the holiday season.\n\nDespite the financial pinch, two-thirds of shoppers (67%) expressed their intention to treat themselves each month. Furthermore, 69% are looking to make smaller purchases that bring them joy. This presents an opportunity for businesses that offer products capable of providing everyday delight during uncertain times.\n\nOne aspect consumers are unwilling to compromise on, even in the face of financial constraints, is sustainability. Globally, 40% of the shoppers we surveyed are willing to pay extra for climate-conscious products. Additionally, 43% indicated a preference for purchasing from brands that prioritize sustainability practices, such as carbon-neutral shipping and minimizing waste. Retailers who offer climate-conscious items can also benefit from word-of-mouth recommendations, as three in five customers (63%) are more likely to recommend a product that is environmentally friendly.\n\nShoppers are now investing more effort into researching brands that uphold their promises regarding the climate crisis. They prioritize products with recyclable packaging and support local businesses to minimize their environmental impact.\n\nOverall, Shopify's survey has shed light on important trends and preferences among consumers and businesses. This holiday shopping season promises to be more deliberate, conscious, and connected. Shoppers are seeking lasting value and are willing to pay extra for sustainable products. Businesses have the opportunity to secure brand loyalty by aligning with consumer values and offering exceptional deals. The 2022 Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend holds great potential for success for those who adapt their strategies to these changing dynamics."}]}

However, this process has remained the same for decades, despite the changing world and people's needs.\n\nAt Shopify, we recognized an opportunity to reimagine this process and create a better story. We developed Flex Comp, an innovative approach to compensation that revolutionizes how we reward talent. Here's how it works:\n\nFlex Comp was designed to shape the future of compensation at Shopify and beyond. We focused on three key elements: agency, clarity, and impact.\n\nAgency: We believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose how their total reward is allocated. Why should a company decide how much of it should be in cash versus equity? With Flex Comp, our employees have the power to determine the allocation that suits their needs. Whether they're saving for a house or early in their career, they can choose more cash or opt for restricted stock units (RSUs) or options. We've also eliminated the one-year cliff on equity, so vesting begins right away. And to accommodate life's changes, we open allocation windows multiple times a year, allowing employees to adjust their choices as needed.\n\nClarity: Under the old industry structure, understanding your earnings was a complex and time-consuming task. Base salary, equity, vesting schedules, stock-market fluctuations, and unpredictable bonuses tied to company performance all added to the confusion. Flex Comp simplifies this process. Our user experience design presents all aspects of total rewards in one place, providing employees with a clear and comprehensive view of their pay.\n\nImpact: As a mission-driven company, everything we do, including our new compensation system, aligns with our mission. We link rewards to the impact individuals have on our mission, rather than market fluctuations or external events. As employees progress in their careers and contribute positively to our mission, their compensation will grow without any limits.\n\nBuilding Flex Comp was no small feat, considering the challenges we faced in the industry. Market-dependent compensation, salary disparities across different locations, and a few decision-makers determining rewards for the majority were just a few of the complexities. However, at Shopify, we thrive on tackling challenges head-on. We set a bold vision for what can be achieved and then work tirelessly to make it a reality.\n\nOur dedicated team, consisting of individuals from various departments, worked collaboratively to bring this ambitious overhaul to life. They passionately embraced the project, even going so far as to engage in intense coding sessions, led by our founder and CEO, late into the night. The commitment to building the best possible system that caters to the diverse needs of our employees, regardless of their job, location, or level, was evident. And it paid off, providing us with a solid foundation to continue developing and improving in the future."}]}

Our goal is to provide Australian merchants with easy and efficient funding options of up to $2.5 million AUD, enabling them to accelerate growth, expand into new markets, and prepare for the upcoming peak sales season.\n\nIn today's challenging business landscape, concerns surrounding inflation, consumer spending, cash flow, and supply chain issues have made it imperative for businesses to remain agile and explore new revenue and growth opportunities. Australian merchants are currently in the process of preparing their businesses for the peak sales season, which involves ordering inventory, planning campaigns, arranging shipping logistics, and hiring additional talent. However, one of the biggest challenges they face is accessing timely funding to make these necessary investments.\n\nAccording to Shopify research, while 62% of Australian merchants are comfortable seeking funds to invest in their businesses, two-thirds (67%) are discouraged by high interest rates, and over half (53%) are deterred by lengthy application processes and timeframes. Traditional lenders often require entrepreneurs to navigate complex and time-consuming application procedures.\n\nHowever, Shopify Capital is not your typical financing solution. We offer a streamlined application process without personal credit checks or the need for cash flow projections from merchants. Using the same Shopify platform they already utilize to run their online stores, merchants can receive funding offers of up to $2.5 million AUD. Our team of experts reviews data-informed and machine learning models to ensure merchants receive the funding they require to grow their businesses.\n\nOnce approved, funds are deposited in as little as two business days, giving merchants the freedom to invest in talent, inventory, and marketing strategies that maximize growth or bridge cash flow gaps during seasonal downturns. Shopify Capital fills the gap that traditional lenders often cannot meet, providing businesses with the funding they need when they need it most, without delays.\n\nRepayment terms are flexible and based on an agreed fixed percentage of daily sales. This approach eliminates the uncertainty of compounding interest rates and hidden fees, reducing cash flow risks for merchants. There is no specific time limit for repayment; rather, merchants pay back funding based on their sales, allowing payments to align with their business performance.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Shopify Capital has provided over $3.8 billion USD in funding to tens of thousands of entrepreneurs in the US, UK, and Canada. Over the past 15 months, there has been a 90% increase in total funding, demonstrating the vital role it plays in accelerating business growth. Merchants who have received funding through Shopify Capital have seen an average increase of 36% in sales within the following six months, outperforming their peers.\n\nTracey Jewel, manager at Batherapy, is a prime example of the growth achieved through Shopify Capital. With two rounds of funding, Tracey expanded her business from selling online-only DIY bath kits to establishing in-studio bath and body product workshops across Perth. She commends the ease of accessing funding through the Shopify platform, as repayments are automatically deducted from each sale. The initial funding round helped boost supplies for the opening of their first studio space in inner-city Perth, and subsequent funding rounds enabled the fast-tracked opening of three additional studios across the city.\n\nAt Shopify Capital, we are committed to supporting entrepreneurs and empowering them to achieve their business goals. With our easy and efficient funding options, Australian merchants can navigate the challenges of today's business environment and seize opportunities for growth and success."}]}

With the launch of YouTube Shopping on Shopify, merchants can easily integrate their online store with one of the world's largest entertainment platforms, reaching over 2 billion monthly logged-in users.\n\nYouTube Shopping offers three ways for Shopify merchants to sell their full range of products: live streams, videos, and the store tab. During live streams, merchants can tag and pin products at key points, allowing consumers to watch and make purchases simultaneously. In on-demand videos, a curated list of products is displayed in a product shelf below. Additionally, a new store tab will be added to a merchant's YouTube channel, showcasing their entire selection of products.\n\nThis partnership is particularly significant in today's market, where meaningful engagement with consumers is essential. Content has become central to brand interactions, blurring the line between merchant and creator. Content creators are now selling goods and building brands, while direct-to-consumer (D2C) merchants are using content to find and engage with new customers.\n\nBy partnering with YouTube, Shopify provides merchants and creators with a powerful way to connect with consumers, grow their businesses, and share their stories. With YouTube Shopping on Shopify, merchants can reach over 2 billion monthly logged-in users, meeting their consumers and viewers where they are.\n\nShopify acts as a merchant's retail operating system, seamlessly keeping product details up-to-date across channels. If a product sells out, it is automatically removed from YouTube. Merchants can also track the performance of live and on-demand videos directly from their Shopify admin, gaining a full view of multichannel sales.\n\nFor eligible merchants in the U.S., the onsite checkout feature on YouTube allows consumers to make purchases without leaving the platform. This multichannel approach is vital in today's commerce landscape, and YouTube is one of the most influential channels available.\n\nWe are thrilled to expand our long-term partnership with Google to push the boundaries of direct-to-consumer commerce on YouTube. This integration will fundamentally change the opportunities available to independent brands in the creator economy. Creators have long built businesses around their YouTube content, often extending their entrepreneurship into building their own brands. However, it hasn't always been seamless to reach their audience with these products directly on YouTube. Through our partnership with Shopify, we aim to help creators bring their stores front and center for their communities on YouTube, where more and more people are turning to shop.\n\nOverall, this collaboration between YouTube and Shopify opens up new possibilities for creators and merchants, enabling them to connect with consumers, grow their businesses, and provide a seamless shopping experience."}]}

These options were costly and only accessible to a select few. However, Shopify was created to break down barriers and make entrepreneurship achievable for all. With our first product, the online store, we revolutionized the industry and made it accessible to everyone. Our internet-based approach gave rise to the global direct-to-consumer (D2C) phenomenon and disrupted online shopping as we know it.\n\nNow, we are excited to announce Shopify Editions, our new semi-annual product showcase that highlights new launches and improvements across our entire platform. With our Summer '22 edition, we are entering a new era of commerce called connect-to-consumer (C2C), which expands the possibilities even further. Shopify pioneered the D2C movement by providing entrepreneurs with a direct line to consumers, and now we are paving endless pathways for merchants to build their businesses.\n\nIn our Summer '22 edition, we have introduced over 100 product updates that demonstrate the speed of innovation and the breadth and depth of our offerings. These updates span across online storefronts, offline experiences, web3, social commerce, checkout, and more. From selling wholesale to leveraging social commerce, strengthening community, and expanding offline presence, we have a range of exciting new releases featured in Shopify Editions.\n\nConnecting with consumers is not limited to one-to-one interactions. There is a vast opportunity for merchants to connect with other businesses and sell wholesale. This opportunity represents billions of untapped revenue, surpassing even the potential of D2C. That's why we are introducing B2B on Shopify. With B2B on Shopify, our Shopify Plus merchants can seamlessly sell to other businesses on the same platform they use for D2C. This eliminates the need for spreadsheets, one-off invoices, and manual data entry. Additionally, we have partnered with ERP providers such as Netsuite, Brightpearl, and Acumatica to integrate merchants' essential data with our B2B solution. For wholesale customers, B2B on Shopify provides a similar online store experience tailored for business buyers, complete with tools that simplify bulk product purchases. Our checkout process offers the necessary payment flexibility for B2B, allowing merchants to set customer-specific prices at fixed rates or discounted retail prices for all their products. It's the same beloved Shopify experience, but specifically designed for wholesale.\n\nTokenGated Commerce - Everyone is currently discussing NFTs, but we believe the most exciting aspect is not just selling NFTs, but activating them. That's where TokenGated Commerce on Shopify comes in. Shopify merchants have already built passionate communities and loyal fans around their brands, and now TokenGated Commerce offers a new way to deepen those connections and reward true fans and VIPs. NFT holders can connect their crypto wallets to a Shopify online store and use their NFTs to gain exclusive access to products, perks, and experiences. Best of all, merchants can activate TokenGated Commerce experiences across various channels, including online, mobile, and physical retail through POS.\n\nIn summary, Shopify is continually pushing boundaries and providing new opportunities for entrepreneurs. With our Summer '22 edition and the introduction of C2C, B2B on Shopify, and TokenGated Commerce, we are transforming the face of commerce once again. Whether it's expanding online storefronts, enhancing offline experiences, or embracing the latest trends like NFTs, Shopify is committed to empowering merchants and driving innovation in the industry."}]}

Since the establishment of our sustainability fund in 2019, we have been vocal about the need to combat this global challenge together. While reducing emissions is crucial, simply stopping emissions will not suffice as there is still an excessive amount of carbon in our atmosphere. It is imperative that we invest in climate-saving technologies to safeguard our future.\n\nWith this in mind, we are excited to announce the launch of Frontier, an advanced market commitment (AMC) in collaboration with Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, and McKinsey Sustainability. The AMC model, previously successful in expediting the development of pneumococcal vaccines for low-income countries, which saved an estimated 700,000 lives, will now be applied to carbon removal at scale for the first time. As the founders of Frontier, we are collectively committing $925 million over the next nine years, starting in 2022, to purchase permanent carbon removal from companies working on promising solutions. Our combined demand will provide the market with the impetus it needs to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies.\n\nFrontier aims to become the largest financial commitment to buy carbon removal worldwide, and I am honored to be part of its founder advisory board. Let me provide more details on how the AMC will operate and how you can participate. The commitment is designed to incentivize new technologies and support those with the greatest long-term potential by facilitating their scalability. Although this may entail paying high prices per tonne presently, it will enable us to expedite the growth of promising technologies that meet specific criteria. These criteria include carbon permanence (lasting over 1,000 years), a physical footprint that leverages carbon sinks with fewer constraints on arable land, cost-effectiveness at scale (below $100 per tonne), a capacity to significantly remove carbon (over 0.5 gigatons per year), and a commitment to ensuring environmental justice through robust local public engagement processes.\n\nThis AMC represents Shopify's next major step in our fight against climate change. Since the inception of our fund in 2019, we have achieved considerable progress by supporting carbon removal solutions through partnerships with 22 entrepreneurial tech-driven companies, committing over $32 million to climate entrepreneurs. Our investments have empowered our climate-forward partners, such as Carbon Engineering, Charm Industrial, Heirloom Carbon, Planetary Hydrogen, and Running Tide, to secure tens of millions of dollars, significantly increase their carbon removal capacity (up to 80 times), and expand their customer bases (up to 40 times). While these pioneering agreements have demonstrated voluntary market demand, we recognize that our efforts alone are insufficient. Therefore, we are highly enthusiastic about the potential impact of Frontier in the carbon removal market.\n\nOur mission with Frontier is to eliminate barriers and facilitate the purchase of carbon removal for other companies, establish high-quality standards, and assume a leadership role in scaling the carbon removal companies selected by Frontier. If you are interested in joining us, please visit frontierclimate.com to learn more about becoming an early Frontier buyer and contributing to this historic carbon removal initiative.\n\nThank you for your attention to this crucial matter.\n\nSincerely,\nStacy Kauk\nHead of Sustainability, Shopify"}]}

The scientific term for it is \"acne mechanica,\" which refers to a type of acne caused by excessive friction, heat, and rubbing on the skin. While athletes typically experience it due to masks and straps worn for prolonged periods, the arrival of COVID-19 has made maskne more common as face coverings have become essential in our everyday lives.\n\nWhy does your mask cause breakouts? Acne bacteria, known as Propionibacterium acnes or P. acnes, naturally resides on all human skin. Although it may not be pleasant to hear, it is a part of our body's natural microbiome. Most of the time, acne bacteria coexists harmoniously with other bacteria, but when it starts colonizing in the pores and hair follicles, feeding on dead skin and oil, it manifests as an acne breakout. Sweat and the humidity generated by breathing into your mask provide an ideal environment for P. acnes bacteria to thrive. Masks can increase the risk of clogged pores and breakouts because they act as occlusives, not allowing the skin to \"breathe,\" thereby trapping oil, sweat, dirt, and makeup in the pores. Prolonged mask-wearing causes friction on the skin, leading to inflammation and irritation, making it more susceptible to infection. This combination can be detrimental to clear skin.\n\nSo, what can you do to prevent maskne? Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Follow CDC guidelines and wear cloth face coverings to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Opt for 100% cotton masks as they are both effective and breathable, reducing sweat and moisture on the skin.\n\n2. Wash your masks frequently to remove sweat, oil, and dirt buildup.\n\n3. Reevaluate your skincare routine and products. Due to the occlusion caused by masks, active ingredients like retinols and acids can penetrate deeper into the skin, increasing the risk of compromising your moisture barrier, which can lead to irritation and breakouts. Apply actives only at night and reduce or discontinue usage if irritation occurs. Consider simplifying your skincare routine if you need to wear a mask for extended periods.\n\n4. Keep your skin well-moisturized to minimize friction from the mask.\n\n5. Take a break from makeup. Since the lower half of your face will be covered by the mask, consider skipping foundation and concealer in that area to prevent clogged pores. If needed, try using a tinted moisturizer for light coverage.\n\n6. Cleanse your face with a mild cleanser every night to remove makeup, oil, and dirt accumulated throughout the day. Follow with a hydrating moisturizer.\n\n7. When required to wear a mask for extended periods, carry multiple clean masks and switch them out periodically.\n\n8. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Hydration is essential for healthy skin.\n\n9. Reduce stress whenever possible. Stress is a significant trigger for acne, and acne itself can cause additional stress, creating a vicious cycle. Finding ways to decompress is crucial, especially during these challenging times, not only for your skin but also for your overall well-being.\n\n10. Consult a dermatologist if you experience rashes, allergic reactions, or severe acne.\n\nBy following these measures, you can minimize the occurrence of maskne and maintain healthy skin."}]}

During the treatment, pulses of light are emitted by the laser and absorbed by the ink particles in the tattoo, causing them to break down into smaller pieces. These smaller particles can then be eliminated by the body's immune system.\n\nIf you are interested in finding a laser tattoo removal service near you, there are several options to consider. Dermatologists and plastic surgeons, who are skilled in treating various skin conditions, often offer tattoo removal services. These professionals have access to a range of tattoo removal devices and can customize the treatment based on your specific needs.\n\nTattoo removal clinics specialize in removing tattoos using dedicated tattoo removal devices, such as the Lutronic Hollywood Spectra. These clinics have experienced providers who solely focus on tattoo removal, which many people find advantageous. They typically offer a variety of laser tattoo removal services and can assist you in selecting the most suitable treatment plan.\n\nMed spas, on the other hand, are wellness centers that often provide laser tattoo removal services. Choosing a med spa can provide a relaxing and comfortable environment for your tattoo removal experience, and you may also discover other aesthetic offerings that align with your interests.\n\nThe cost of laser tattoo removal can vary significantly based on several factors, including the size and location of the tattoo, the ink color, the type of laser used, and the expertise of the professional performing the procedure. On average, a laser tattoo removal session can cost between $200 and $500 or more per session. Multiple sessions are typically required over 6-10 week intervals to achieve complete removal. The overall cost will depend on the size, depth, and color of the tattoo, as well as the number of treatments needed.\n\nThe number of treatments necessary for tattoo removal varies depending on factors such as the color and size of the tattoo. Larger tattoos with multiple colors generally require more treatments than smaller, single-color tattoos, often black ink. The age of the tattoo also plays a role, as older tattoos may require fewer treatments due to natural fading. The depth of the ink is another factor, with deeply and densely placed tattoos usually requiring more treatments. The type of ink used, especially amateur or homemade tattoos, can also affect the removal process. Additionally, skin type can influence the number of treatments needed, with darker skin often requiring more caution during the procedure.\n\nOn average, most individuals require between 5 and 10 treatments for complete tattoo removal (defined as over 90% reduction in the appearance of tattoo ink). However, some individuals may need more or fewer treatments depending on the factors mentioned above. It is important to note that complete removal of a tattoo is not always possible, and there may be residual ink or discoloration after treatment.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that laser tattoo removal does not guarantee complete removal and some residual ink or discoloration may persist. The success of the procedure also depends on the patient's skin type, tattoo location, and age. Nevertheless, laser tattoo removal is generally considered safe and effective, and has become a popular alternative to traditional methods like surgical excision or dermabrasion."}]}

Originating from the Greek language, the term \"melasma\" loosely translates to \"black spot,\" reflecting the stubborn nature of this condition. Melasma typically appears on the forehead, cheeks, and upper lip, setting it apart from other forms of hyperpigmentation. What makes it particularly challenging to successfully treat is that it is not only worsened by exposure to ultraviolet light, but it is also hormonally-induced.\n\nWho is at risk of developing melasma? While melasma can affect up to 33% of the population, women are at a significantly higher risk than men, with men accounting for only 10% of the affected population. Approximately 15% to 50% of pregnant women experience melasma, commonly known as \"pregnancy mask,\" which typically fades after giving birth. Melasma is most prevalent during a woman's reproductive years, typically appearing between the ages of 20 and 40. The use of oral contraceptives can also increase the risk of melasma due to the elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone, which are believed to contribute to the condition. Individuals with darker skin tones are also more susceptible to melasma due to higher melanin levels. Moreover, those with hypothyroidism face an increased risk due to hormonal imbalances caused by an underactive thyroid.\n\nWhy does melasma seem to fade and reappear? Those who have witnessed their melasma improve, only to have it resurface, understand the frustration of managing this condition. Given the multitude of contributing factors and the significant influence of hormonal fluctuations, it is notoriously challenging to control and maintain. While melasma can occur throughout the year, most individuals experience a resurgence in the summer months when heat and sunlight exacerbate the condition. Conversely, they may observe fading in the winter months. Regardless of the season or weather, it is vital to wear broad-spectrum SPF daily to minimize the harmful effects of UV radiation.\n\nIs there anything else one can do to improve melasma besides using SPF? As we bid farewell to the last days of summer and approach the holiday season, many individuals are considering laser treatments to fade melasma and enhance their overall complexion. The Lutronic Hollywood Spectra is the first short-pulse laser to receive FDA clearance for melasma treatment and is suitable for all skin types. Alongside visible improvement in melasma, a series of Hollywood Spectra treatments will leave your skin looking brighter and clearer, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles thanks to its collagen-stimulating properties.\n\nIf you are grappling with melasma, it is important to remember that you are not alone. Although there is no cure, this condition is treatable and manageable."}]}

Canadian Nuclear Labs, situated in Chalk River, Ontario, has been at the forefront of designing, building, and experimenting with nuclear reactors since World War II. Over the years, Canada has harnessed and refined its nuclear fleet, cultivating a robust industry with highly skilled professionals.\n\nWith an unwavering enthusiasm, Canadian Nuclear Labs continues to conduct world-class research leveraging our nuclear science and technology to enhance lives worldwide. Our current energy mix relies on the combined power of nuclear energy from our 19 reactors and renewable sources such as hydroelectricity, which together generate more than three-quarters of Canada's carbon emission-free electricity grid.\n\nNuclear energy, characterized by its cleanliness, reliability, and affordability, plays a vital role in forging a clean, low-carbon future. Esteemed scientists and environmentalists concur that nuclear power stands among the few dependable energy sources capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By avoiding the use of fossil fuels, nuclear power already curtails carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 2.5 billion tonnes each year on a global scale. As nuclear power further integrates with other low-carbon sources, it will continue to diminish the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nNuclear power stations serve as the workhorses of the power grid, delivering consistent and reliable electricity production. This stability allows for the expansion of intermittent power generation methods. Moreover, nuclear energy maintains cost competitiveness with other electricity generation forms due to its low and stable fuel costs, which constitute a small proportion of the overall expense.\n\nIn collaboration with wind and solar energy, nuclear power enables the creation of clean, carbon-free electricity grids. Given that electricity on the grid must be consumed immediately, this partnership ensures our power needs are met even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Canada's nuclear reactors provide baseload power, guaranteeing a steady electricity supply to the grid and providing flexibility for renewables to adapt to changing demand. Furthermore, upcoming nuclear reactor designs boast improved load following capabilities, meaning they can respond to fluctuating electricity demands throughout the day. This enhanced efficiency of nuclear power in conjunction with renewables negates the necessity to rely on fossil fuels as a backup power source.\n\nThese exciting advancements are crucial in our fight against climate change. Canada, with its longstanding leadership in nuclear science and technology, is excellently positioned to maintain its global prominence in the development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs). With over 60 years of innovation, a world-class regulator, and a robust domestic supply chain, Canada's nuclear industry is poised to capture a substantial market share in the estimated $150 billion global market by 2040."}]}

As the only expandable, low-carbon energy source that can offer reliable and affordable electricity, nuclear power is well-equipped to meet our climate goals.\n\nTo combat climate change, it is crucial for humanity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, which has a carbon budget limit. In order to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming below 1.5\u00b0C, we can emit up to 580 gigatonnes more of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, the burning of fossil fuels currently results in approximately 37 gigatonnes per year. We must act quickly to increase our supply of carbon-free energy, including nuclear, solar, and wind power.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries worldwide have committed to limiting their total carbon emissions, which should help us stay within the carbon budget. However, some countries are struggling to meet these commitments. For example, Germany had to increase its fossil fuel use due to the closure of nuclear power plants, and China is significantly expanding its coal-fired electricity generation. Even Canada is not on track to achieve its target of reducing carbon emissions by 30% between 2005 and 2030.\n\nTo stay within the carbon budget, there are three main strategies to pursue. The first is reducing energy consumption, which has seen some success. The second is carbon capture, exemplified by ongoing efforts in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. However, neither of these strategies alone can lead us to a carbon-neutral future. We must also prioritize greening our energy mix, maximizing energy efficiency, and capturing carbon dioxide. Replacing fossil fuels with low- and zero-emission energy sources is crucial.\n\nSolar, wind, and tidal power have made significant progress in the past decade, reducing prices. However, they still account for only two percent of Canada's total power generation. Hydroelectric power is a zero-emission option that Canada has extensively utilized, but it is limited to specific geographic locations and has almost reached its maximum capacity at 90%. On the other hand, nuclear power produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, requires less land than hydroelectric power or renewable sources, and Canada has an abundant supply of uranium. There are numerous potential sites for nuclear power plants, making it a promising tool in the fight against climate change.\n\nTo assess carbon emissions accurately, it is essential to consider the entire life cycle, including construction, supply chain, operation, decommissioning, and disposal. When all these factors are taken into account, nuclear power compares favorably to renewable energy sources and outperforms fossil fuels. According to the World Nuclear Association, the world's 445 reactors save 2.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Future reactors have the potential to save even more.\n\nThe success of utilizing nuclear power to transition to greener electricity grids can be seen in Ontario, Canada. Until the 1990s, the province relied heavily on coal for electricity, resulting in significant emissions. However, with the presence of 18 nuclear power reactors, Ontario was able to eliminate coal from its energy mix by 2014. This transition not only improved air quality but also significantly reduced carbon emissions. Despite a 30% population growth since 1990, emissions in the province were 161 megatonnes in 2016, according to the Ontario Auditor General."}]}

However, the CTA urges the Canadian government to take further action, specifically targeting employers in the trucking sector who engage in the deceptive practice known as \"driver inc,\" which denies truck drivers their rights under the labor code.\n\nThe three-year pilot program, announced by Minister Randy Boissonnault, will commence in September. The CTA, which has advocated for a similar shift in the TFW program, sees the REP as a positive step towards addressing labor shortages and reducing administrative burdens for recognized employers. However, the success of the pilot in safeguarding foreign workers in the trucking sector depends on the criteria for becoming a recognized employer and must be supported by a thorough audit and oversight system to ensure desired outcomes.\n\nStephen Laskowski, President of the CTA, emphasizes the labor shortage in the trucking industry and the need to recruit more Canadian and foreign workers. He believes that the announcement will help stabilize distribution networks in various sectors of the domestic economy. Laskowski also stresses the importance of restricting access to foreign labor through the TFW program or other immigration programs to recognized employers that strictly adhere to labor compliance. To establish the credibility and effectiveness of the program, the Canadian government must implement a robust auditing system to ensure compliance with the law and protect workers from scams like \"driver inc.\"\n\nParticipation in the REP will offer streamlined application processes for employers, a 36-month validity for the labor market impact assessment (LMIA), and recognition on Canada's job bank to facilitate the recruitment of potential workers. The agricultural sector will reportedly be included in the pilot program starting in September 2023, with other sectors following in the new year. While the CTA awaits complete details on employers' qualification for the REP, preliminary information suggests that employers must have received at least three positive LMIAs for the same occupation within the past five years, based on designated occupations supported by the Canadian Occupational Projection System (COPS) data.\n\nThe CTA has already submitted a plan to collaborate with the federal government in establishing a recognized employer program for the trucking sector, which includes labor compliance audits to protect both foreign and domestic workers from the \"driver inc.\" scam. The CTA views this pilot program as an excellent opportunity to introduce these measures to our sector.\n\nOverall, the REP is a positive development in addressing labor shortages and protecting workers in the trucking sector. The CTA is enthusiastic about the potential of this pilot and looks forward to working with the government to ensure the program's success."}]}

As the pandemic prompts increased infrastructure spending, there is a growing emphasis on building back better and greener. This raises the question of how public procurement can contribute to both our economic recovery and environmental objectives. To explore this, the C.D. Howe Institute recently hosted a policy seminar involving leaders from various sectors. While consensus can be challenging, we hope this collaboration demonstrates that viable solutions are available and underscores the need for political leadership.\n\nOne such solution is green procurement, which involves sourcing goods and services with a smaller carbon footprint. Governments worldwide now have an opportunity to include this approach in their plans for post-pandemic economic recovery. Given that many Canadian commodities, including steel, have low carbon emissions, it is worth considering a system that prioritizes and normalizes green public procurement. This would not only significantly reduce emissions and help Canada achieve its net-zero goals but also strengthen the economic and environmental partnerships between Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Biden administration has explicitly linked climate action to the creation of good union jobs. Given the steel sector's low carbon emissions and the quality unionized jobs it provides, Canadian-made steel should enjoy a clear advantage in U.S. plans. As each other's most important trading partners, Canada and the U.S. share a common vision for climate action. There is a consensus among us that more must be done to seize the significant opportunity before us. This is a central focus of the roadmap for a renewed U.S.-Canada partnership launched by Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden earlier this year.\n\nWhile a greening government initiative was initiated in April, Canadian officials must engage in deeper dialogue with their American counterparts regarding green procurement.

Canada possesses the necessary resources and expertise to become a global leader in low-carbon transportation fuels, with robust energy infrastructure and sustainable feedstocks. However, our competitive investment climate lags behind that of the United States, with which we compete for investment in the North American fuels market.\n\nOver the past two decades, the US has implemented successful programs, including tax credits, to attract investment in clean fuels. As a result, they have developed a strong capacity for clean fuels production, while Canada has become increasingly reliant on clean fuel imports. Members of the Canadian Fuels Association (CFA) are currently among the largest producers of clean fuels, and since 2020, they have remained committed to producing more clean fuels within Canada.\n\nHowever, the US IRA, introduced last summer, has changed the game by offering generous production tax credits (PTC) for low-carbon transportation fuels and sustainable aviation fuel. This PTC has significantly tilted project economics in favor of clean fuel projects in the US. Unfortunately, this development threatens to result in the export of Canadian-grown feedstocks to the US, leading to significant economic losses for Canada and undermining our energy self-sufficiency.\n\nThis situation is particularly concerning as CFA members have planned large-scale renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, and ethanol projects, worth $8 billion, with the potential to deliver 10 million metric tons of greenhouse gas reductions across the country. However, these projects are now at risk of being delayed or relocated to the US due to the lack of investment parity.\n\nParkland's recent decision to discontinue plans for a renewable diesel facility in Burnaby, BC, citing the IRA as a key factor, highlights the urgency for a response from the Canadian government. Therefore, we call for the introduction of a clean fuel production tax credit in Budget 2023. This credit would apply to all clean fuels produced in Canada, including ethanol, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and hydrogen, providing the necessary investment certainty. Similar to the US, the credit rate would vary based on carbon intensity, incentivizing greater greenhouse gas reductions.\n\nImplementing a clean fuel production tax credit would yield economic and climate benefits throughout the value chain, from feedstock providers to distribution, while reducing our dependence on imports and creating numerous direct and indirect jobs for Canadians. We cannot risk losing these additional economic and climate benefits for Canada.\n\nAs Environment and Climate Change Minister Stephen Guilbeault recently stated, the Inflation Reduction Act has made innovation in clean tech more competitive than ever, leaving no room to stick with the status quo. Canada's transportation energy sector has played a vital role in our economic success for over a century. We now have a unique opportunity to become a global leader in clean fuel production while meeting the evolving energy needs and climate goals of Canadians.\n\nBudget 2023 is a critical juncture. We must respond to the IRA or risk being left behind, jeopardizing our economy, energy security, and climate goals."}]}

This exciting development reflects Canada Post's commitment to electrify its last mile fleet and contribute to a sustainable future for Canadians. The Nanaimo depot will employ 14 fully electric cargo vans for collection and delivery services, replacing traditional internal combustion vehicles.\n\nAligned with Canada Post's goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the company has pledged to electrify 50% of its national fleet, consisting of approximately 14,000 vehicles, by 2030. By 2040, the entire fleet will be fully electric. President and CEO of Canada Post, Doug Ettinger, and Chair of the Board of Directors, Suromitra Sanatani, were present at the depot's official launch to announce the introduction of these electric delivery vehicles.\n\nMs. Sanatani emphasized the corporation's commitment to sustainability, stating, \"Last year, Canada Post allocated more than $1 billion towards emissions reduction and the electrification of our last mile fleet. This significant investment has propelled us forward in our aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Canadians expect their postal service to lead the way in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and Canada Post embraces this responsibility.\"\n\nMr. Ettinger acknowledged Canada Post's history of adaptability and expressed enthusiasm for the corporation's transformation plan, which includes substantial investments in service, capacity, and environmentally-friendly operations. He stated, \"We are dedicated to meeting the evolving needs of Canadians and businesses alike. Our transformation plan involves billions of dollars to bolster our services, increase capacity, and prioritize sustainability. With our extensive network, this depot may mark a small initial step, but it is a crucial one as we begin to gain momentum.\"\n\nCanada Post's commitment to sustainable delivery extends beyond fleet electrification. The company has adopted science-based targets to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It is retrofitting existing facilities, constructing new net-zero carbon buildings, and sourcing renewable energy for its real estate and operations. The Albert Jackson processing centre in Scarborough, Ontario, represents a pinnacle of these efforts, functioning as a net-zero facility with the capacity to process over a million packages daily.\n\nHaving already experimented with electric and low-emission vehicles over the years, Canada Post is now in the preliminary stages of fleet electrification. The corporation is introducing electric vehicles at select plants and depots to assess the most suitable equipment, charging infrastructure, and operational approaches. Additionally, Canada Post has been testing innovative and sustainable delivery options, such as e-cargo trikes for bike path travel and compact, low-speed electric cargo vehicles designed for neighborhood delivery routes. The company also intends to participate in the market to acquire new vehicles across various classes.\n\nCanada Post's introduction of battery-electric corporate delivery vehicles in Nanaimo represents a significant step towards achieving its sustainability goals. By prioritizing electrification, investing in green infrastructure, and exploring innovative delivery options, Canada Post is paving the way for a stronger, greener Canada."}]}

The country's healthcare infrastructure is severely under-resourced, particularly in underserved areas, which are vulnerable due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Afghanistan has faced decades of instability, including severe droughts and natural disasters. As a result, millions of people lack access to healthcare and proper nutrition, placing them at risk of malnutrition and disease outbreaks. The situation is especially dire for women and girls, who face additional obstacles to healthcare due to education and workforce restrictions.\n\nThe revised Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan for 2023 reveals a concerning increase in the number of people in need of aid, with 28.8 million individuals requiring immediate assistance compared to 18.4 million in August 2021. The plan aims to provide health assistance to 14 million people, including 7.5 million children and 3.1 million women. While progress has been made in reaching 8.4 million individuals in the first half of 2023 and providing a total of 25.7 million healthcare services between 2022 and 2023, insufficient funding threatens to cut off essential health assistance to 8 million people. Additionally, 450,000 patients may lose access to life-saving trauma care services, and 1.6 million individuals with mental health conditions may lack necessary consultation and support.\n\nThe WHO's alert highlights the dire consequences of continued underfunding for Afghanistan's healthcare system. Barriers to delivering comprehensive services, especially for women and children, pose a significant challenge and increase vulnerability, particularly in underserved areas. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, emphasizes the gravity of the situation, as the lack of resources and funding endangers countless lives, with women and children suffering the most. He calls on donors to generously support life-saving work.\n\nDr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, urges the international community to unite with the WHO in addressing the ongoing humanitarian health crisis in Afghanistan. He stresses the collective responsibility to act now and warns of catastrophic consequences if no action is taken. Dr. Luo Dapeng, WHO Representative to Afghanistan, expresses concern about the underfunding of the health system and calls for immediate action while expressing gratitude to current partners.\n\nIn the second half of 2023, the WHO will continue to work with its partners to address critical health emergencies, provide life-saving interventions, and build upon the successes of 2022. The organization remains committed to its strategic areas of protecting people every day, reaching everyone everywhere, and prioritizing the health of mothers and children, while also coordinating health partners and delivering effective health services in Afghanistan.\n\nFor more information about the alert and the WHO's response to Afghanistan's humanitarian health emergency, please follow the hashtag #afgemergalert on @whoafghanistan or view the alert here."}]}

It is clear that more effort, from implementation to investment in health, is needed to reach this globally agreed goal.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that low- and middle-income countries would need to significantly increase their health spending to achieve the health-related SDGs. This would require an additional $371 billion annually by 2030. This funding would not only improve access to health services but also contribute to building new facilities and training and placing health workers where they are needed. \n\nIn addition to the pre-existing challenges, recent disruptions to health services caused by conflict, climate change, and economic instability have further increased the need for additional funding to achieve universal health coverage. Furthermore, preparing for future pandemics would require a massive investment of approximately $31.1 billion annually, with approximately one-third of that amount coming from international financing.\n\nTemporary increases in government spending driven by the pandemic response led to a rise in global health spending, reaching approximately $9 trillion in 2020, which is nearly 11% of the gross domestic product. Public spending accounted for about 63% of this amount. However, it will be challenging for countries to find the necessary funds to meet the ambitious goal of universal health coverage, especially as national budgets are strained due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\n\nTo address this challenge, new sources of funding and innovative products that can mobilize the resources of the private sector are needed. It is clear that individual countries cannot solve the health care conundrum on their own; global solidarity and collective efforts are necessary. In light of this, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the World Health Organization are launching a new investment platform. This platform aims to mobilize impactful and coherent investments in primary health care (PHC) systems in individual countries to improve their resilience. Resources from partners like the European Commission are being channeled to remove investment risks and make the conditions highly attractive for beneficiary countries. The inter-American Development Bank is also considering joining this partnership to extend the initiative to the Latin American and Caribbean region.\n\nThe focus on primary health care is crucial because approximately 90% of essential health services can be delivered through quality primary health care. By bringing health professionals, doctors, and nurses closer to communities in local clinics, primary health care promotes health, prevents diseases, and reduces the need for costly secondary and tertiary services. It ensures that even the most rural and remote locations have access to essential health services and plays a vital role in a country's overall health system.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis have taught us the importance of investing in health services that can reach all individuals. It has revealed that health services are central to national security, development, and prosperity. Solidarity and equity must be integral parts of any health service solution. Cooperation between multilateral organizations and development banks is crucial in addressing these challenges.\n\nWe will focus on driving measurable impact in people's health outcomes by using innovative finance mechanisms to encourage domestic funding and contribute to our shared goal of health for all, without burdening countries with unsustainable debt. The launch of this new investment platform will take place in Paris at the Summit on a New Global Financing Pact, which will be held on June 22-23, 2023. At this summit, we will call for the generation of necessary finances to fight inequalities in health and other areas and to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, including the climate transition.\n\nGood health and well-being are goals shared by the entire world. However, achieving these goals will require collaboration between countries and institutions. As we strengthen our cooperation, we firmly believe that collaboration between nations and between governments and the private sector is critical to achieving universal health coverage. We invite our partners to join us in this global investment platform."}]}

We are proud to join the campaign led by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), our trusted partner, to pay tribute to these humanitarian heroes.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) launched an appeal for $2.54 billion in February to address the urgent needs of the most vulnerable populations facing intersecting emergencies. Our contributors have made it possible for WHO to respond to these challenges and alleviate suffering, enabling people to thrive. From responding to cholera outbreaks in Haiti and delivering COVID-19 vaccines in Sierra Leone and the Solomon Islands to providing earthquake relief in Turkey and improving healthcare access in the occupied Palestinian territory, our work has made a tangible impact.\n\nIn Haiti, after the resurgence of cholera in the west department, which became the epicenter of the outbreak in October 2022, PAHO/WHO collaborated with local authorities and NGOs to coordinate a logistical operation and enhance patient care facilities on La Gon\u00e2ve Island.

Despite being one of the first West African nations to receive COVID-19 vaccines, only 14% of the population was vaccinated by March 2022. Our community nurses and mobilizers worked tirelessly to reach these remote communities, traveling long distances and overcoming obstacles to deliver vaccines.\n\nIn the Solomon Islands, reaching the mountain village of Kuvamiti to provide healthcare and immunizations was a daunting task. Nurse Rosemary Raikekeni, stationed at the Totongo health clinic on the coast of Guadalcanal, made a six-hour journey over bumpy roads to be the nearest permanent healthcare provider for many villages in the far interior. The journey to Kuvamiti village involved crossing rivers and navigating treacherous terrain, requiring significant effort and dedication.\n\nTo further support COVID-19 vaccine delivery, WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi established the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership in January 2022. This partnership aims to intensify support and ensure the efficient delivery of vaccines to communities in need.\n\nWe extend our deepest gratitude to all our contributors who have made it possible for WHO to respond to humanitarian emergencies, alleviate suffering, and empower communities to thrive. Together, we can continue making a positive impact and honoring the humanitarian heroes who selflessly serve those in need."}]}

The campaign aims to raise awareness about the importance of testing and treatment for viral hepatitis, as the disease has the potential to surpass malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV in terms of fatalities by 2040 if current infection rates continue. Hepatitis causes liver damage and cancer, resulting in over a million deaths each year.\n\nAmong the five types of hepatitis infections, hepatitis B and C are responsible for the majority of cases and deaths. While hepatitis C can be cured, only 21% of those infected have been diagnosed and merely 13% have received curative treatment. Similarly, only 10% of people living with chronic hepatitis B are diagnosed, and a mere 2% of those infected are receiving life-saving medication.\n\nUnder the theme of \"One Life, One Liver,\" the World Health Organization's World Hepatitis Day campaign emphasizes the significance of safeguarding the liver against hepatitis for a prolonged and healthy life. Maintaining good liver health also benefits other vital organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, which rely on the liver's proper functioning.\n\nDespite the availability of better tools than ever to prevent, diagnose, and treat hepatitis, millions of people worldwide are living with undiagnosed and untreated cases. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO, highlights the organization's commitment to supporting countries in expanding the utilization of these tools, including cost-effective curative medications, to save lives and eradicate hepatitis.\n\nThe WHO will provide new guidance to track countries' progress towards eliminating hepatitis by 2030. To reduce new infections and deaths from hepatitis B and C, countries must ensure access to treatment for all pregnant women with hepatitis B, provide hepatitis B vaccines for newborns, diagnose 90% of people with hepatitis B and/or C, and offer treatment to 80% of all diagnosed individuals. Additionally, countries must prioritize optimal blood transfusion, safe injections, and harm reduction practices.\n\nVaccination, testing, and treatment are vital opportunities to protect the liver from hepatitis. The reduction of hepatitis B infections in children through vaccination is a crucial intervention in limiting overall viral hepatitis infections. The target for hepatitis B incidence is the only Sustainable Development Goals' (SDG) health target that was achieved in 2020 and is on track for 2030. However, many African countries still lack access to birth dose hepatitis B vaccines. Gavi's recent restart of its vaccine investment strategy, which includes the birth dose hepatitis B vaccine, will kickstart vaccination programs for newborns in West and Central Africa, where mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission rates remain high.\n\nTo eliminate mother-to-child transmission, the WHO recommends testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B during their pregnancy. If positive, they should receive treatment, and vaccines should be provided to their newborns. However, a recent WHO report reveals that out of the 64 countries with a policy, only 32 have implemented activities to screen for and manage hepatitis B in antenatal clinics. Similarly, 80% of the 103 countries surveyed have policies in place to screen and manage hepatitis B in HIV clinics, with 65% doing the same for hepatitis C. Enhancing hepatitis testing and treatment within HIV programs will protect people living with HIV from developing liver cirrhosis and cancer.\n\nAlthough treatment rates for hepatitis C have been increasing for years, the progress in accessing curative treatment is now slowing down. The WHO urges taking advantage of price reductions in medication to accelerate the expansion of treatment. A 12-week course of medication to cure hepatitis C now costs $60 in low-income countries, significantly reduced from the original cost of over $90,000 when first introduced in high-income countries. Treatment for hepatitis B costs less than $30 per year ($2.4 per month).\n\nFor individuals seeking to maintain liver health, the WHO recommends hepatitis testing, treatment if diagnosed, and vaccination against hepatitis B. Reducing alcohol consumption, achieving a healthy weight, and managing diabetes or hypertension also contribute to liver health."}]}

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe economic crisis, undoing progress towards ensuring decent work for everyone. Although global economies have shown signs of recovery since 2021, the improvement in employment opportunities remains challenging and fragile. \n\nAs we reach the midpoint-review of the 2030 agenda, it is evident that multiple crises are putting immense pressure on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. According to the 2023 UN World Economic Situations and Prospect Report (WESP), the growth momentum in the United States, European Union, and other developed economies has weakened, causing ripple effects worldwide. The projected world output growth is expected to decelerate from an estimated 3.0% in 2022 to 1.9% in 2023, marking one of the slowest rates in recent decades. \n\nGrowth in real GDP per capita, which averaged 1.8% from 2015 to 2019, experienced a sharp decline of 4.1% in 2020. While it slowly increased by 5.2% in 2022, the growth in 2023 is estimated to be slower, falling short of the SDG target of 7%. The global employment opportunities have also been significantly impacted, particularly for women and youth. The UN Secretary General's 2023 SDGs report emphasizes a significant decline in unemployment rates in 2022, resulting in a total global unemployment estimate of 192 million. However, job recovery in developing countries has been slower, with rates higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAdditional challenges, such as the impacts of climate change, have also hindered countries' efforts to achieve productive employment and decent work for all. To address these issues, it is crucial to focus on implementing a financial system that not only addresses rising debt and economic uncertainty but also promotes equitable pay and decent work opportunities for young people. This is especially important considering the disproportionate effects of the pandemic on women and young individuals in the labor market. While some recovery has been observed, young people aged 15-24 still face difficulties in finding decent employment. Furthermore, many young individuals, particularly young women, were not in education, employment, or training in 2022, particularly in regions such as Central, Southern, and Western Asia, and Northern Africa.\n\nEnsuring the achievement of SDG 8 requires a comprehensive approach that addresses financial challenges, promotes economic stability, and focuses on providing equitable opportunities for all young people to secure decent work."}]}

On August 8, 2023, interest rate hikes implemented by global central banks to combat the largest inflation outbreak in four decades placed strain on banks in the United States and Europe. While rate hikes typically benefit lenders by increasing lending revenues, this time was different. Some banks suffered losses on bond holdings, including safe US treasuries, which caused concern among customers who swiftly withdrew their funds. This issue was magnified by technological advancements and social media. As a result, several banks experienced failures.\n\nOur financial sector assessment program is a crucial component of our surveillance efforts, closely monitoring financial stability risks within individual countries and assessing their resilience. We also evaluate the adherence of financial sector supervision, regulation, crisis management tools, and safety nets, such as emergency liquidity support and deposit insurance, to international best practices. In addition, our program conducts stress tests to identify potential risks to banks and has recently enhanced risk assessments for nonbank financial intermediaries, including pension managers, insurers, and asset managers.\n\nOur work is conducted against the backdrop of ongoing central bank interest rate increases and the potential for borrowing costs to remain elevated for longer than anticipated by investors, businesses, and households. This situation has the potential to increase financial stability risks and dampen economic growth, as we highlighted in July. The tightening of monetary policy could also lead to market volatility and rapid changes in bond and interest-rate derivatives markets. Even safe US treasury securities could experience a decline in value, possibly up to 30%, when yields rise by 400 basis points\u2014an actual shock that has occurred since 2020 in 10-year treasury note yields.\n\nPrior to March, our focus was primarily on the risks posed to nonbank financial institutions from shifts in bond markets. Many of these institutions have substantial investments in bonds and are vulnerable to valuation losses. Investment funds, in particular, may face rapid redemptions as customers swiftly withdraw from unprofitable funds. While pension and life insurance companies are less prone to runs due to penalties associated with early withdrawal, companies that employ derivatives and other complex transactions to enhance returns may face margin calls if the value of these instruments decreases. This was exemplified by some UK pension funds last year.\n\nThe events in March served as a reminder of the importance of bank runs. Regulatory reforms implemented after the global financial crisis aimed to enhance the resilience of banks by increasing their cash and bond holdings. Additionally, many countries established mechanisms for banks to borrow more easily from central banks to avoid selling bonds during periods of declining markets. However, in the case of Silicon Valley Bank, these safeguards did not effectively mitigate the impact of rapid monetary tightening. The value of the bank's bond holdings decreased, which affected its earnings, capital, and cash buffers. Depositors observed these strains and withdrew their funds. Unfortunately, the bank was not adequately prepared to access central bank liquidity in a timely manner and subsequently failed, along with other US lenders."}]}

This cautious approach is driven by investors' optimistic view of low inflation and the anticipation of a soft landing. However, this strategy could introduce financial stability risks and hinder economic growth.\n\nIn July 27, 2023, overall inflation in the United States and the Euro area has significantly decreased due to notable declines in energy and food prices. Year-on-year headline inflation currently stands at around 3 percent in the United States and below 5.5 percent in the Euro area. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has declined at a slower pace, particularly in services inflation.\n\nMarket expectations suggest that headline inflation will continue to decline rapidly in the coming quarters, although some participants still foresee potential risks leading to higher inflation. This sentiment may be influenced by recent stickiness in core inflation. Market pricing data reveals that such upside risks are particularly prominent in Europe, where investors assign similar probabilities to inflation reaching the European Central Bank's 2 percent target or remaining around 4 percent. In the United States, investors appear to anticipate inflation above the target at around 3 percent.\n\nDespite ongoing monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, financial conditions, as measured by our index reflecting financing costs faced by households and firms in housing, credit, and equity markets, have eased considerably in both the United States and the Euro area. This easing has occurred due to investors' relatively optimistic outlook on price pressures, which has contributed to increased market valuations.\n\nThis recent easing presents a challenge for central banks in their endeavors to bring inflation back to their 2 percent targets. Traditionally, tighter monetary policy has been transmitted to the real economy and subsequently to inflation through a tightening of financial conditions. Although financial conditions are currently tighter compared to the extremely loose levels observed in mid-2021, the recent easing could complicate the fight against inflation by preventing the necessary slowdown in aggregate demand to mitigate inflationary pressures.\n\nAdditionally, the combination of an extended period of loose financial conditions and a tightening monetary policy cycle in advanced economies, which began when inflation was already elevated, further complicates the transmission of monetary policy to financial conditions. For instance, a significant proportion of fixed-rate mortgages with low rates, resulting from refinancing in recent years, exists in the United States. Similarly, corporations have taken advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs and sufficient liquidity to extend their debt maturities. These factors may have reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, as many mortgage holders and companies are only now experiencing higher borrowing costs. Consequently, this contributes to the ongoing strength in labor markets and aggregate demand. It is worth noting that other factors, such as structural changes in the labor market or housing markets following the pandemic, could also have played a role.\n\nWhile financial condition indices based on financing costs in capital markets have improved, monetary policy transmission also occurs through credit extension, particularly for borrowers reliant on bank lending. Bank credit growth remains positive in both the United States and the Euro area, although the pace of growth has slowed significantly, especially in the latter. Recent surveys of loan officers in both regions indicate a considerably slower demand for credit and tightening of underwriting standards by banks, suggesting a potential further deceleration in bank credit provision.\n\nRecent earnings reports from large banks have shown strength, with higher interest rates charged on loans boosting earnings while deposit remuneration continues to lag behind policy tightening. However, lending survey results suggest that profitability could moderate in the future."}]}

While domestic policies can support growth in the coming years, the long-term prospects of Tuvalu rely heavily on the global community's ability to prevent destructive global warming outcomes.\n\nDespite experiencing limited health consequences from the pandemic due to prompt containment and widespread vaccination, Tuvalu has suffered significant economic fallout. Economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels, climate adaptation projects have been delayed, fiscal pressures have increased, and outbound migration threatens Tuvalu's growth potential. Addressing these risks, ranging from climate change to fiscal sustainability, becomes more challenging in light of this setback.\n\nDuring our recent visit to Tuvalu as part of our regular economic review and consultation with the authorities, we emphasized the importance of comprehensive policies to reduce uncertainty and foster private-sector activity. Enhancing revenue generation and optimizing government spending efficiency will promote fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, fiscal reforms, such as strengthening spending oversight, can facilitate access to climate finance from donors. Given the enormous climate adaptation needs relative to the size of the economy, securing this financing remains critical.\n\nIn addition, reforms to strengthen the connectivity of the domestic banking industry to the global payments system, deepen trade integration, and enhance human capital through initiatives like designing scholarships for overseas study are essential for Tuvalu's development. A more diversified economy that builds resilience will also incentivize Tuvaluans to utilize their skills within the country, thereby reducing migration pressures.\n\nHowever, while domestic policies can contribute significantly to fostering growth in the coming years, Tuvalu's long-term prospects are contingent upon the collective ability of the world to prevent destructive global warming scenarios. Without urgent action, under a high global emissions scenario and with its existing infrastructure, Tuvalu could become uninhabitable by the end of this century due to rising sea levels. This existential threat faced by Tuvalu mirrors the situation of hundreds of millions worldwide who reside in coastal areas.\n\nIn conclusion, the plight of Tuvalu due to climate change underscores the responsibility of the global community to intensify efforts in reducing global emissions. Tuvalu's future resilience depends on our collective determination to address this global challenge and safeguard the existence of vulnerable nations."}]}

In 1993, the Declaration of the Elimination of Violence Against Women recognized that violence against women is a violation of their rights and called on states to work towards eradicating it. Unfortunately, even after thirty years, women still face the risk of violence in various settings such as their homes, on the streets, in schools, and at work. It is estimated that one in three women worldwide have experienced intimate partner violence and/or sexual violence from a non-partner in their lifetime. Additionally, gender-based violence includes the millions of girls who are married before the age of 18 and those who have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\nThe negative impacts of gender-based violence are significant, affecting not only the survivors but also their children and society as a whole. It hinders the well-being of survivors and their ability to form human capital by subjecting them to negative life experiences. The fear of sexual harassment also limits the mobility and productivity of women and girls, resulting in economic consequences. In fact, a study conducted by the International Finance Corporation in Fiji revealed that perceived threats to safety and reduced productivity at work lead to an average of almost 10 days of lost work per employee each year.\n\nRecognizing the importance of addressing gender-based violence, the World Bank has significantly increased its efforts in prevention and response. Our project work spans across countries, regions, and sectors, often involving partnerships with local, regional, and international governmental and non-governmental organizations. For instance, in Bangladesh, our health project focuses on providing immediate response services and safe spaces for women and girls from the displaced Rohingya population and their host communities. The same program also works towards changing community attitudes and behaviors that perpetuate gender-based violence by adapting the Sasa! program, which aims to transform unequal gender norms.\n\nIn Haiti, we collaborate with women-led local civil society organizations to improve the quality and reach of essential services for survivors and women at risk of violence. This project also promotes the social and economic empowerment of women and girls through community-based activities. Similarly, in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, our education sector project establishes girls' and boys' clubs that empower girls, enhance their socio-emotional skills, and promote positive masculinity to foster safe schools. In India, our transport projects support the government in enhancing the safety of public spaces by mapping and assessing perception of safety and developing policy guidelines that prioritize women's safety in the design of transport networks. Furthermore, in Uzbekistan, our policy financing operation helps survivors of gender-based violence by establishing referral pathways as part of reforms to create inclusive labor markets and encourage female labor force participation.\n\nOur social inclusion and sustainability operations aim to ensure inclusion and empowerment for all individuals, mobilizing collective action to prevent gender-based violence at the community level. For example, in Nigeria, our project focuses on improving economic opportunities for women through building social capital and livelihood support for nearly 20,000 women's groups. The project utilizes the social norms exploratory tool to identify and address the social norms that perpetuate gender inequality.\n\nTo further our efforts, we have released a new report, \"Gender-Based Violence Prevention and Response in World Bank Operations: Taking Stock After a Decade of Engagement.\" This report distills the lessons learned over the past ten years and highlights the most promising operational examples from various regions. We have actively engaged with key actors, including ministries of finance, education, health, transport, and social affairs, to prioritize the gender-based violence prevention and response agenda. Our discussions have been informed by global knowledge and consultations with stakeholders such as local women's groups.\n\nIn the upcoming discussion, we will delve into these initiatives in greater detail."}]}

This declaration aims to reduce learning poverty by at least 25% and improve literacy rates to 75% by 2030. While progress has been made, Africa still faces challenges in human capital development. Nearly 100 million children are out of school and lacking proper nutrition and stimulation, and a large percentage of students attending school are not learning effectively.\n\nThe continent's Human Capital Index score is only 0.40, indicating that young people are not reaching their full productivity potential. To harness the energy and capabilities of Africa's youth, increased investments in education and job creation are essential. This requires both financial resources and political commitment.\n\nDuring the summit, participants acknowledged the challenges of prioritizing human capital in the face of fiscal constraints and other difficulties. However, they unanimously recognized the importance of education and health as the foundation of human capital. The discussions emphasized the need to improve the quality of instruction, especially in reading and numeracy, as well as teacher training and secondary school completion, particularly for female students. Strengthening the connection between education and the labor market was also highlighted. Investments in healthcare, nutrition, and stimulation were seen as crucial in preparing children to learn effectively.\n\nTo achieve the goals of the Dar es Salaam declaration and unlock Africa's potential, everyone must play a role. Governments must show leadership and make bold policy choices, the private sector should provide skills and create jobs, civil society must drive momentum for change and ensure accountability, and donors and partners need to mobilize resources and offer technical support.

The lessons learned from the Ebola crisis, including the importance of swift detection, early testing, and rapid response, have emphasized the need for cross-border collaboration and solidarity among neighboring countries and the international community. Investing in resilient health systems and effective surveillance mechanisms is crucial for combating infectious diseases, as has been shown by the response to the Ebola crisis.\n\nHealth experts in Nigeria and Senegal have shared their strategies to curb the spread of the pandemic and prepare for its impacts. Following the West Africa Ebola crisis, the World Bank launched the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement (REDISSE) project, which leveraged over $600 million to strengthen health systems and support disease surveillance in 16 West and Central African countries. The Institut Pasteur in Dakar, accredited by the World Health Organization, played a vital role in testing for COVID-19. The institute, which had been preparing since January, trained multiple laboratories in the region, resulting in over 30 laboratories now equipped to test for the coronavirus. The REDISSE program enabled the Institut Pasteur to enhance its surveillance system and procure additional laboratory equipment to increase its testing capacity while ensuring safety and quality protocols.\n\nCoordination among all partners, both within countries and across boundaries, is crucial to prevent the spread of outbreaks.

Madelyne Castillo, a psychology student at the Public University of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, faces numerous challenges due to the lack of elevators or ramps on campus. Unfortunately, her situation is not unique. Throughout the region, many systems and infrastructure are not designed to accommodate persons with disabilities. This becomes even more problematic when natural disasters strike, as they are occurring more frequently and with increased severity each year.\n\nWhile early warning systems and preparedness plans can provide assistance, they often overlook the needs of individuals with hearing or vision disabilities. Additionally, the lack of wheelchair accessibility and restrictions on service animals in shelters further exacerbate the difficulties faced by persons with disabilities during disasters. Even after a disaster, the consultation of persons with disabilities is often disregarded when reconstructing infrastructure, resulting in inaccessible environments for them.\n\nConsidering that approximately 85 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean live with a disability, it is crucial to address these issues. Globally, 15% of the world's population experiences some form of disability, as defined by the United Nations. Disabilities encompass long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that, when coupled with attitudinal and environmental barriers, hinder full and equal participation in society.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, it is imperative to focus on changing the environment to be more accessible and inclusive. This perspective emphasizes the interaction between individuals and their surroundings, allowing for modifications that accommodate persons with disabilities. In the region, disabilities can result from various causes, including car accidents, chronic diseases like diabetes, labor-related injuries, and violence such as gun violence and gender-based violence. Women with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, which can further lead to disabilities.\n\nPersons with disabilities face several disadvantages, including limited access to education, poorer health outcomes, lower employment levels, and higher poverty rates. Efforts to increase employment opportunities for persons with disabilities have been made, but the existing barriers to education hinder progress. For instance, in Santo Domingo, only five buses out of many have wheelchair ramps, requiring individuals to rely on others for assistance, thereby compromising their dignity and independence.\n\nHowever, positive developments are occurring. The Dominican Republic, along with other countries in the region, is demonstrating political will to improve employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. Disabled people's groups are actively engaged and organized, collaborating with their governments to promote inclusion. Strong leadership and commitments from governments have been witnessed in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Ecuador.\n\nIt is essential to foster an inclusive and accessible environment for persons with disabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean. By addressing the barriers they face and promoting their full participation in society, we can create a more equitable and just region."}]}

These crises can be triggered by conflicts, economic shocks, natural disasters, and rising fertilizer and food prices. Unfortunately, the poorest people are the ones who suffer the most from these crises. In 2023, the situation is expected to worsen, with both acute and chronic levels deteriorating further.\n\nThe Global Report on Food Crises 2022 Mid-Year Update indicates that the number of people requiring urgent humanitarian assistance is projected to reach up to 205 million in 45 countries/territories covered in the report. This necessitates immediate action to protect lives and livelihoods and prevent the erosion of hard-earned development progress. Time is of the essence in responding to such crises, as delays can amplify their severity and prolong vulnerabilities, undermining resilience to future shocks.\n\nCrisis preparedness, which involves the ability to anticipate, respond to, and recover from major shocks, is crucial in addressing these issues. To promote better preparedness for food and nutrition security crises, the World Bank, in collaboration with the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS), the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), UNICEF, WFP, and the UN Famine Prevention and Response Coordinator, is supporting countries in developing and implementing Food Security Crisis Preparedness Plans (FSCPPs).\n\nAn FSCPP is a national operational plan that outlines the criteria for identifying a major food and nutrition security crisis in a country. It also outlines protocols, roles, and timelines for mobilizing additional funding and scaling up early action. By bringing together various elements of crisis preparedness into a coherent framework, FSCPPs facilitate the timely recognition of emerging crises and prompt coordinated responses across government, humanitarian, and development partners to prevent and mitigate their impacts.\n\nThe FSCPP draws on the strengths of over 60 multilateral and bilateral partners involved in GAFS, the Global Food and Nutrition Security Dashboard, and GNAFC. It is guided by seven key principles:\n\n1. Government ownership and leadership: Whenever possible, the government takes the lead in developing and managing the FSCPP, involving relevant national and local institutions and agencies. In cases where the government's operational capacity is limited, the international community supports these functions until the government can effectively take over.\n\n2. Focus on major food and nutrition security crises: The FSCPP prioritizes shocks that have widespread and severe consequences across the country, extending beyond existing chronic issues. It ensures that responses are mobilized through government, humanitarian, and development channels.\n\n3. Evidence-based: The FSCPP relies on rigorous, well-vetted, and timely food and nutrition security information from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of emerging risks.\n\n4. Holistic approach: In the event of a major crisis, the FSCPP calls for swift scaling up and coordination of activities across government, humanitarian, and development partners. It leverages the unique strengths of each partner to save lives, protect livelihoods, and enhance resilience to future shocks.\n\n5. Do no harm: The FSCPP takes into account country and local contexts, considering how responses may interact with and impact existing economic, political, and social dynamics, particularly for vulnerable populations."}]}

On behalf of the 34 Anishnaabe and Dakota nations in southern Manitoba, SCO is pleased to share new details and images regarding the transformation of this iconic structure, located at the corner of Portage Avenue and Memorial Boulevard in Treaty One territory.\n\n\"The formal transfer of the HBC building to SCO on the Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn project is a momentous occasion for Southern First Nations,\" stated SCO Grand Chief Jerry Daniels. \"Although there is still much work to be done in order to transform the space, this building will become a home to hundreds of families, providing childcare services, a health and healing center, a remarkable museum, restaurants, a place of commemoration to honor survivors, and much more. This journey signifies a vital step towards reconciliation.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2022, SCO welcomed HBC Governor Richard Baker and Prime Minister Trudeau to our territory. Together with the Southern Chiefs, the Premier, the Mayor, and community leaders, we announced plans to transform the HBC heritage building into a venue that promotes economic and social reconciliation. Since the announcement, SCO and HBC have worked closely to ensure a smooth transfer. Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn, which means 'it is visible,' will revitalize the HBC building while preserving its rich heritage and contributing to the revitalization of downtown Winnipeg.\n\n\"HBC is immensely proud to further our partnership with SCO and achieve this milestone by officially transferring ownership of the building,\" said Richard Baker, Governor of HBC. \"We remain committed allies to SCO as they work to realize their incredible vision for this new space, and we hope that others will be inspired to take meaningful action towards reconciliation in their own way.\"\n\nSCO has issued a request for qualifications to initiate the redevelopment process using a competitive approach, ensuring the best value for the project. This redevelopment marks the largest transformation of a historic building in Manitoba and is one of the most significant projects of its kind in Canada. Our aim is to reopen the building in November 2026, coinciding with its 100th anniversary.\n\nNearly a century ago, the construction of the HBC building at 450 Portage Avenue involved 300 men, 120 teams of horses, 20 trucks, and two steam shovels to excavate 150,000 tons of earth for the foundation of the store. Upon its opening in 1926, the structure, designed by Canadian architect Ernest Isbell Barrott, became the largest reinforced concrete building in Canada, boasting over six hectares of floor space.\n\nThe Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn project includes plans for over 300 affordable housing units for families and post-secondary students, as well as culturally safe assisted living units for First Nation elders. Residents and employees of the building will also have access to much-needed, high-quality licensed childcare services and a rooftop garden. The project prioritizes the improvement of First Nation peoples' health and wellness, with a health and healing center that combines both Western and traditional practices.\n\nMoreover, this historic building will serve as the future governance house for the chiefs of the Southern First Nations, representing the voice of the 34 Anishinaabe and Dakota nations in the territory now known as Manitoba. The main floor will be dedicated public space, welcoming Manitobans, Canadians, and tourists from around the world to come together and experience a world-class museum that shares the history of the Anishinaabe and Dakota peoples, partly through artifacts reclaimed from the Vatican vaults. The building will also provide essential space for ceremonies and commemorations, including a memorial to honor the survivors of residential and day schools, as well as the children who never returned home."}]}

This update includes new regional poverty aggregates for Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia, and the group of advanced countries. We now have sufficient survey data available for these regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a total of 113 new country-years added, bringing the total number of surveys to over 2,100.\n\nIn addition to the new data, this update incorporates the usual changes to input data, such as revisions to existing welfare distributions, the inclusion of new welfare distributions, and revisions to price, national accounts, and population data used for global poverty monitoring. However, these changes have resulted in only minor revisions to global and regional poverty estimates.\n\nTable 1 provides a summary of the revisions to the regional and global poverty estimates between the September 2022 and March 2023 data vintages for the reference year 2019, at all three poverty lines. At a poverty line of $2.15, the global poverty headcount ratio has been revised slightly upward by 0.1 percentage points to 8.5 percent, resulting in a revision in the number of poor people from 648 to 659 million. This revision represents an increase of 11 million people living in extreme poverty, largely driven by South Asia (5 million) and the Middle East and North Africa (4 million).\n\nSimilar limited changes in poverty estimates are observed at the higher poverty lines of $3.65 and $6.85, which are typically used for measuring poverty in lower-middle and upper-middle-income countries respectively. At $3.65, the global poverty headcount ratio increases by 0.1 percentage points to 23.6 percent, representing 28 million more people living in poverty. At $6.85, the global poverty rate increases by 0.2 percentage points to 46.9 percent, representing 44 million people living in poverty. The upward revisions in poverty estimates at the higher lines are largely driven by South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThis March 2023 Global Poverty Update from the World Bank revises previously published global and regional estimates from 1981 to 2019. Regional poverty estimates are now reported up to 2021, depending on sufficient data coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. For Europe and Central Asia, poverty data are reported until 2020, and for Latin America and the Caribbean until 2021. For all other developing regions, poverty data are reported for pre-pandemic years.\n\nIt's important to note that the data published in this PIP update, while incorporating more recent input data, do not change the overall perceptions about global poverty trends and the regional distribution of poverty. Global poverty has been declining since the 1990s, albeit at a slower rate since 2014. Extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions, except the Middle East and North Africa due to conflict and fragility. In 2019, approximately 60% of the world's extreme poor lived in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, while 81% of the global poor at the poverty line of $3.65 lived in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia."}]}

All 24 schools located in the areas affected by the February 2023 earthquakes and aftershocks remained intact. Fortunately, the earthquakes occurred outside of school hours, ensuring the safety of students and educators. Murat \u00c7i\u00e7ekdal, the school manager for Martyr Ercan Sanca Primary School, expressed, \"Most parents came to inspect the school and noticed there was not even the slightest crack or plaster damage. We have seamlessly resumed our educational activities from where we left off before the earthquake.\"\n\nFour schools in Kahramanmara\u015f province have been used by the Turkish government as temporary shelters and for providing essential services to affected populations. Across Turkey, it is estimated that over 40,000 individuals now have access to safer and more resilient schools due to the Ministry of National Education's Safe Schools initiative, supported by the Education Infrastructure for Resilience Project. Approximately half of these beneficiaries are female. In addition to seismic safety, each of the 57 schools constructed under this project adheres to Turkish codes and regulations on land use planning, energy efficiency, fire protection, workplace safety, and accessibility for people with disabilities. The outcome has been a safer and enhanced learning environment for students and trainees.\n\nTurkey has been at the forefront of promoting the agenda for safer schools, recognizing the need for resilient education infrastructure in one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. Since 2015, Turkey has partnered with the World Bank and GFDRR, including through the Global Program for Safer Schools (GPSS), to ensure the safety and resilience of schools nationwide. GFDRR, in particular, has facilitated the exchange of international experiences on safer schools, established a program for reducing seismic risk, and supported the expansion of disaster-resilient education infrastructure through initiatives like the Education Infrastructure for Resilience Project and the Disaster Risk Management in Schools Project.\n\nMoving forward, the World Bank and GFDRR remain committed to assisting Turkey in its recovery and rebuilding efforts following the devastating earthquakes. Additionally, they will continue to lay the foundation for a more resilient future by supporting Turkey's efforts to enhance disaster resilience."}]}

As the challenges of environmental degradation become more urgent, it is crucial to equip young people with the tools to promote sustainable development. One of the key ways to achieve this is through media and information literacy (MIL), which empowers youth with the knowledge and critical thinking skills needed to navigate complex environmental issues and develop green skills for a more sustainable future.\n\nAs we celebrate International Youth Day, it is important to recognize the role of media and information literacy in fostering green skills among young individuals. By providing youth with the ability to critically engage with media content and make informed decisions, we empower them to become leaders in sustainable development. MIL not only enhances their understanding of environmental issues but also enables them to drive change, promote eco-friendly practices, and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come.\n\nGreen skills encompass a range of competencies and knowledge aimed at environmental sustainability. These skills enable individuals to contribute to eco-friendly practices, develop innovative solutions for environmental challenges, and actively participate in the transition to a greener and more sustainable economy. They cover areas such as renewable energy, waste reduction, conservation, sustainable agriculture, and more. By acquiring these skills, young people can play a vital role in driving sustainable development and mitigating the impacts of climate change.\n\nMIL serves as a catalyst for the development and promotion of green skills among youth. In a world flooded with information, misinformation, and rapidly evolving technologies, MIL equips young individuals with the ability to critically assess and analyze media content, discern credible sources, and make informed decisions. It empowers them to filter through the noise, identify reliable information, and gain a deep understanding of environmental issues and solutions. MIL enables young people to access a wealth of information on environmental conservation, climate change, and sustainable practices through various media channels, including websites, documentaries, podcasts, and social media. They can learn about successful green initiatives, cutting-edge technologies, and inspiring stories of environmental stewardship. By developing media and information literacy skills, youth can amplify their impact by sharing accurate and impactful information with their peers, communities, and the wider world.\n\nMIL encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for tackling complex environmental challenges. Young people with MIL skills can analyze data, evaluate policy proposals, and think creatively about sustainable solutions. By critically engaging with information, they can contribute to informed discussions and decision-making processes related to environmental issues, advocating for policies that prioritize sustainability. MIL empowers young individuals to become agents of change by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Equipped with accurate information and critical thinking abilities, youth can identify gaps in the market for sustainable products and services. They can develop and launch green start-ups, creating solutions that address environmental challenges while generating economic opportunities. MIL enables them to navigate the business landscape, connect with mentors, and access resources that support their entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nUNESCO, as the leading organization promoting media and information literacy, empowers people to think critically about information and the use of digital tools. It helps individuals make informed choices about their participation in peacebuilding, equality, freedom of expression, dialogue, access to information, and sustainable development. UNESCO supports and champions media and information literacy initiatives worldwide."}]}
