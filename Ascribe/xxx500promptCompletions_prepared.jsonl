Representing a diverse range of backgrounds, nearly 1,000 young Canadians from across the nation have provided insight for this report.\\n\\nCanadian youth are actively engaged, resourceful, and resilient. They are not only the leaders of tomorrow but also of today. Well-acquainted with the pressing issues facing our country, they possess the ideas and solutions necessary for addressing them. The report focuses on their highest priorities, such as truth and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, environmental sustainability and climate action, health and wellness, leadership and impact, employment, and innovation, skills, and learning. It conveys their perspectives on these matters and introduces their vision for constructing a more inclusive Canada that benefits all.\\n\\nThe past year has indeed been challenging for everyone as we have grappled with a global pandemic, and Canadian youth have been particularly affected. They have made tremendous sacrifices to protect their loved ones. As we undertake the process of reconstruction, it is imperative that we place them at the forefront of our recovery efforts. In response to this crisis, the Government of Canada has made investments to support vulnerable youth, particularly those facing barriers to employment. Furthermore, we are facilitating a smoother path for young individuals to pursue and complete their education, reduce their student debt burdens, and discover training and employment opportunities. By investing in our youth, we are investing in the success and long-term prosperity of our nation.\\n\\nMy deepest appreciation goes to the countless young individuals who contributed to the creation of this report, as well as to all those involved in its preparation. As the former Minister of Youth, I am eager to advance this vital work through both my youth council and the ongoing implementation of Canada's groundbreaking youth policy. The government remains committed to attentively listening to the voices of Canadian youth, collaborating with them, and taking decisive action to empower them to instigate change within their communities and bring their aspirations to fruition.\\n\\nCanada's inaugural State of Youth Report is truly remarkable, serving as a reminder that young people throughout our country are brimming with innovative approaches for addressing complex issues. The recommendations found within this report stem from engagement sessions with approximately 1,000 young Canadians, including those from First Nations, M\\u00e9tis, Inuit, Black and racialized communities, and LGBTQ2 youth. Many of these individuals encounter barriers that impede their meaningful participation in society. In my role as Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, I have had the privilege of meeting countless youth who exhibit unwavering commitment to building a better nation. Like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I firmly believe in the power of youth. This is precisely why ensuring that this report was developed \\\"for youth, with youth, and by youth\\\" was of utmost importance.\\n\\nWhile this report might be the first of its kind, it closely aligns with our government's longstanding dedication to forging a brighter future for Canadian youth. Additionally, it is crucial to acknowledge that youth in Canada represent a mosaic of society, each with unique circumstances influenced, in part, by their geographic location, life stage, and background. These intersecting identities contribute to the vibrant diversity of our nation but can also hinder the realization of youth's full potential. Bearing this significant context in mind, I invite you to peruse this report, reflect upon its recommendations, and gain further insight into the experiences of young people in our country, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. I firmly believe that listening to and heeding the voices of our young leaders is the only path to realizing a better future for all Canadians.\"}"}

But what does it mean to have a feminist approach to international assistance? It certainly does not mean neglecting the needs of men and boys in favor of prioritizing women. Instead, the feminist international assistance policy (FIAP) is feminist because it addresses the underlying causes of poverty through an intersectional, human rights-based, and feminist lens. This means recognizing and considering the various forms of discrimination that individuals and groups face.\\n\\nBy adopting this approach, we can identify and assist those who are experiencing extreme poverty, vulnerability, and marginalization. The FIAP aims to promote equality by addressing the key barriers that prevent it. This is crucial because we cannot eradicate poverty without taking into account the diverse needs of different groups of people. Approximately 55% of the global population faces instability and poverty, with gender inequalities disproportionately affecting women and girls in both Canada and around the world. This is especially true for marginalized women and groups on the fringes of society.\\n\\nTo create a more peaceful and prosperous world for everyone, we must tackle these inequalities to ensure that people, regardless of their gender identity, expression, sex characteristics, or other identity factors, can fully enjoy their human rights. The goal of the feminist policy is to reduce poverty worldwide, and interventions that advance gender equality have been proven to make significant progress towards this goal.\\n\\nFor instance, a United Nations study found that closing the gender gap in farming and agrifood systems could increase global gross domestic product by almost a trillion US dollars, benefiting 45 million food-insecure individuals. By empowering women through development interventions, such as those implemented by projects like SeedChange, we can significantly improve incomes for an additional 58 million people and enhance the resilience of 235 million more.\\n\\nSeedChange, as an example, focused on the Central American dry corridor, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Ethiopia. It ensured that women held 50% of leadership positions in farming cooperatives and increased their participation in traditionally male-dominated areas. This initiative resulted in improved seed, food, and economic security for 26,046 small-scale farm households. Over five years, the data collected demonstrated that the project led to healthier diets, better livelihoods, improved climate resilience, and increased autonomy within each community. Furthermore, over 100 women's groups and nearly 40 youth-run cooperatives successfully overcame the obstacles they faced in entering the marketplace.\\n\\nIn Gaza, female-headed households were particularly susceptible to poverty and pronounced inequality due to traditional gender roles. Through the Canada-funded Salalem Leadership Institute, Sarah, a single parent of two, joined an eight-week entrepreneurship training program and received support for her agricultural startup. Sarah, who had been involved in farming since childhood with the help of her mother and brothers, fulfilled her dream and established a business that would secure a future for her children. With the guidance of Salalem, she improved her farming practices and expanded her business. Sarah has now successfully completed six consecutive farming seasons and, after one year of running her business, was able to rent a larger plot of land and diversify her farming production. She also ventured into animal breeding and production by purchasing goats.\\n\\nThese examples highlight the positive impact that focused interventions can have in breaking down barriers, empowering women, and fostering economic and social development. By supporting initiatives that promote gender equality, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world for all.\"}"}

You need to consider the size, layout, location, and appearance of the building while also adhering to zoning and environmental regulations.\\n\\nCommercial buildings come in various shapes, locations, and prices, so it's important to understand your needs and budget. If you have a business plan, you should have an idea of how much you can allocate for rent or a mortgage, utilities, and taxes. Conducting a cash-flow analysis can help determine whether purchasing a property is feasible or if renting is a more viable option. Renting may allow you to retain more working capital for your business, but don't forget to factor in possible rent increases. Owning a property offers the advantage of predictable monthly mortgage payments and the opportunity to build equity for your business.\\n\\nWhen making the decision to buy or lease a commercial space, carefully evaluate your options. Meanwhile, here are five tips to help you find the right location for your business:\\n\\n1. Tailor your selection to your business's needs: If you're a retailer, consider factors such as ample parking, pedestrian traffic, and attractive decor. Locating your business near a popular store can attract walk-by customers. For high-end clothing retailers, it's best to stay away from discount malls and instead be close to other similar high-end retailers. Wholesale or manufacturing businesses should prioritize compliance with zoning regulations. Additionally, assess employee availability within a half-hour commute. For personal, professional, or creative services, prioritize closed offices in pleasant surroundings with high-speed networking and easy access to public transit. The ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical for such businesses, making a centrally-located building advantageous. When assessing a loading dock, consider its location, condition, and number within the facility.\\n\\n2. Evaluate necessary modifications: If you have found a suitable building in a good location, consider the modifications needed and who will bear the costs. If you are renting premises that require modifications, negotiate with the owner and ensure the terms are specified in the lease, including clear deadlines and penalties for non-completion. If you plan to purchase, hire an accredited inspection company to assess the building for defects and the property for environmental contamination. Defects can be used for negotiation or avoided altogether to prevent future issues. Keep in mind that some modifications may require approval from local boards due to zoning or heritage regulations. Even minor changes may need municipal approval and can result in delays and uncertain outcomes.\\n\\n3.

They not only shape the geography of our country, but also play a significant role in our history and the experiences of those who live and visit here. These parks are established to safeguard and showcase exceptional examples of natural landscapes and phenomena found in each of Canada's distinct natural regions, as outlined in the national parks' system plan. When creating new parks, we also consider ecological connectivity with other regions and whether an area is adequately represented in the system plan.\\n\\nThese pristine locations, found in every province and territory, encompass a diverse range of environments, from mountains and forests to tundra and glaciers, among others. National parks safeguard the habitats, wildlife, and ecosystem diversity that characterize these natural regions. They can be found along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts, as well as within the interior mountains, plains, and great lakes. National parks vary in size, with the smallest being 14 km\\u00b2 (Georgian Bay Islands National Park of Canada) and the largest covering almost 45,000 km\\u00b2 (Wood Buffalo National Park of Canada). Famous parks like Banff and Jasper, as well as more recent additions like Ivvavik and Vuntut, contribute to Canada's natural heritage.\\n\\nParks Canada is dedicated to preserving the ecological integrity of these remarkable natural areas while also managing them for the benefit of visitors. By appreciating the awe-inspiring landscapes and surroundings of national parks, visitors can develop a deeper connection with nature, respect it, and make a commitment to its protection. Each national park serves as a sanctuary for the human spirit, simultaneously telling the stories of these lands' natural origins and ongoing processes. Floods, fires, and species migration showcase the ever-evolving nature of these environments. National parks provide opportunities to connect with nature, people, and the defining events of these lands' history.\\n\\nVisitors can paddle through canyons formed over thousands of years, observe migrating birds resting along traditional routes, and walk through vibrant forests transformed by fire. These experiences are indelible, and Parks Canada enriches them further with a range of offerings. Ensuring the ecological integrity of national parks is a priority for Parks Canada, as it involves maintaining or restoring the health and wholeness of ecosystems. This includes preserving biodiversity, structures, and functions so that they remain unimpaired and likely to endure.\\n\\nNational parks are a source of great pride for Canadians and an essential part of our national identity.

This seemingly impossible task is successfully accomplished by the resilient monarch butterflies. These remarkable creatures not only journey across the Great Lakes, but also traverse entire countries during migration. However, the migration of this endangered species is becoming increasingly challenging each year.\\n\\nIn the autumn, monarch butterflies escape the cold through migration. They travel from southern Canada all the way down to Mexico to spend the winter. Come spring, a new generation of butterflies embarks on a journey of thousands of kilometers from Mexico. They cross the United States, spanning fields, mountains, and even the great lakes, to return to Canada and begin the cycle anew.\\n\\nConsider the consequences if the butterflies arrived in Canada only to find asphalt and manicured lawns. They would have no sustenance or shelter. Parks Canada is taking action to prevent this by ensuring the availability of vital resources, and we need your assistance! Thankfully, when monarchs cross Lake Erie from the United States, they are greeted by Point Pelee National Park. Point Pelee, the southernmost point of mainland Canada, boasts the highest ecological diversity amongst national parks in the country. Here, the butterflies can find plentiful food and rest, much-needed after their arduous journey.\\n\\nSome butterflies then continue their migration northward and eastward through Ontario. They may find residence in Parks Canada-administered locations such as Bruce Peninsula National Park, Rouge National Urban Park, Georgian Bay Islands National Park, and others. However, these are only temporary stops along their migration route. Beyond national parks, the butterflies face landscape fragmentation caused by urbanization, roads, industrial agriculture, and other factors. The loss and fragmentation of their habitat make their already challenging journey even more difficult.\\n\\nTo support endangered species like the monarch butterfly, Parks Canada is restoring ecosystems to create stepping stones of habitat. These stops allow species to move more freely within their natural environment. By planting native trees, grasses, and wildflowers in protected areas, Parks Canada is establishing food and habitat where migrating birds and butterflies can rest and replenish before continuing their lengthy journey. In collaboration with Indigenous communities, partners, and volunteers, Parks Canada has restored over 40 hectares (98.8 acres) of meadow, coastal sand dune, and savannah habitat in Ontario's national parks. These habitats are essential for pollinators.\\n\\nIn the past five years, together, we have planted over 145,000 native shrubs and trees, as well as nearly 18,000 native grasses and wildflowers. While Parks Canada's efforts to conserve and restore healthy ecosystems are crucial, they are just one component of a larger puzzle. You, too, can contribute by providing habitat \\\"stepping stones.\\\" Imagine if, after leaving a national park, a monarch butterfly discovered your yard, garden box, or balcony filled with native plants. There, it could rest and refuel before continuing its journey to another protected area.\\n\\nEven a small garden or a few native plants on your balcony can make a significant impact, especially in urban areas. If space does not allow for planting at home, consider joining a community garden in your neighborhood. To aid pollinators, we recommend planting a variety of native plants and wildflowers. Milkweed is particularly important for monarchs, as it is the only plant monarch caterpillars eat. Consult the ecoregional planting guides or the \\\"Find Your Roots\\\" native plant finder tool provided by Pollinator Partnership Canada for recommended plants in your area.

Reasons for this lack of attention can be attributed to the fact that wetlands do not fit neatly into the categories of terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, according to Dr. Chantal Vis, an expert in aquatic ecosystems at Parks Canada. Consequently, research efforts are limited due to the challenges of studying wetlands from both land and water. Furthermore, wetlands suffer from a lack of appreciation, with many regarding them as wastelands. Throughout history, wetlands have been drained for the sake of agricultural and urban development, a trend that persists even today. In Southern Ontario, up to 68 percent of wetlands have been lost, while urban areas in the prairies have seen a staggering depletion of up to 96 percent.\\n\\nIn popular culture, wetlands are often depicted as ominous and eerie places, associated with snakes, monsters, and various ominous forces, as Jim Stafford's song \\\"Swamp Witch\\\" from 1973 suggests. However, Stafford's portrayal fails to capture the truth about wetlands, which provide invaluable ecosystem services that work in our favor. Wetlands serve as effective biofilters, with sediment settling at the bottom as water passes through them. Microbes in the sediment breakdown pollutants, while wetland vegetation, such as cattails and bulrushes, absorb toxic substances like heavy metals and fertilizer residues. This impressive purification process has earned wetlands the nickname \\\"nature's kidneys.\\\" Moreover, wetlands are crucial for flood and erosion control, effectively slowing down and absorbing water during periods of excessive rainfall, and gradually releasing stored water during dry seasons. Their benefits extend beyond their immediate surroundings, as wetlands absorb carbon dioxide, a significant greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Bogs, in particular, play a key role due to their high peat content.\\n\\nBiological richness is another aspect of wetlands that should not be overlooked. Scientists estimate that approximately one-third of North American species at risk depend on wetlands. These ecosystems also provide essential resources like fuel and building materials in many parts of the world.\\n\\nRecognizing the value of wetlands, Rouge National Urban Park in Ontario has collaborated with Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, schools, community groups, and indigenous partners to restore over 60 hectares of wetland, stream, and riverbank habitats since 2015. Restoration efforts often involve the recreation of wetlands in areas where they have historically existed. According to Julia Phillips, an ecologist at Rouge, this process is more than simply digging a hole and filling it with water. Careful consideration is given to drainage lines and the placement of berms to retain water on the landscape, all while thinking like beavers. The collaboration between Phillips' team and the conservation authority has successfully created or restored several wetlands in the park, some of which are adjacent to agricultural areas. These wetlands not only filter agricultural runoff but also mitigate flooding on farmers' fields, providing a designated outlet for excess water. In essence, the restoration and creation of wetlands aim to revive the original spongy landscape present in these regions.\\n\\nThe ongoing efforts at Rouge National Urban Park and other national parks highlight the vital role played by wetlands as natural engineering systems essential for maintaining the health of our environment. \\\"It's the habitat we've lost the most of,\\\" states Dr. Chantal Vis, emphasizing the tremendous contributions of wetlands, which often go unappreciated. Perhaps it is time for someone to compose a song acknowledging their significance.\"}"}

However, this despised crustacean may hold the key to tackling the global issue of plastic pollution. Parks Canada has teamed up with Dr. Audrey Moores, a chemistry professor at McGill University, to explore the potential of using the shells of European green crabs to create biodegradable plastic. This partnership, described by Chris McCarthy, the Resource Conservation Manager for Parks Canada's Mainland Nova Scotia Field Unit, as a \\\"marriage made in heaven,\\\" presents an ironic twist - a harmful pest supporting the cause of \\\"green chemistry.\\\"\\n\\nThe collaboration began after Dr. Moores published a paper on using chitin, the material found in the shells of insects and crustaceans, to produce biodegradable plastic. Gabrielle Beaulieu, the Coastal Restoration Project Manager at Kejimkujik National Park and Historic Site in Nova Scotia, noticed this research and reached out to Dr. Moores. Kejimkujik was dealing with its own green crab invasion, a common problem in Atlantic North America. Ms. Beaulieu and Mr. McCarthy saw an opportunity to turn their challenge into a solution, or at the very least, the raw material for a solution. Mr. McCarthy stated that Dr. Moores was truly inspired by their initiative.\\n\\nThe partnership has already achieved success through a crowdfunding campaign organized by the Fathom Fund, a project of the Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network (MEOPAR). Parks Canada is contributing $20,000 to the project, allowing for the employment of a full-time researcher near Kejimkujik. This support will aid in tackling the green crab invasion.\\n\\nKejimkujik's battle against the green crab began in 2007, as conservation staff noticed a concerning decline in eelgrass, a vital marine plant that serves as a nursery for various undersea species, including commercially fished species. By 2010, eelgrass coverage in the port joli estuary had plummeted to just 2% of 1987 levels. The disappearance of eelgrass had devastating consequences, affecting not only marine life but also the birds that rely on these species for sustenance. Adult green crabs tear out eelgrass to access their food sources, such as clams, mussels, oysters, smaller crabs, and even small fish.\\n\\nTo combat this issue, Kejimkujik started trapping and removing green crabs using rowboats and canoes. They also implemented a citizen science activity called \\\"Gone Crabbin'\\\" that allows park visitors to participate in the control program. As a result, over 2 million green crabs have been removed from the estuary locations within the park, leading to the return of nearly 40% of the original eelgrass beds and an improvement in overall estuary biodiversity. Kejimkujik has already made progress in creating a demand for green crabs as lobster bait and an edible resource. This new partnership ensures a year-round demand for the crustacean, benefiting both coastal communities and ecosystems, and potentially contributing to the overall health of the ocean.\\n\\nConventional plastic poses a significant threat to the world's oceans, as it does not degrade and can easily enter the food chain. Approximately one-third of the world's plastic ends up in the ocean. Although biodegradable plastic made from chitin already exists, it is currently produced on a small scale and may have harmful environmental effects. Dr. Moores' green chemistry approach aims to produce clean, large-scale biodegradable plastic from European green crab shells. This groundbreaking research demonstrates how a despised creature like the European green crab may eventually contribute to ocean health. It is both satisfying and promising when a notorious offender becomes a valuable resource for important work.\"}"}

However, it is essential to approach this matter with enthusiasm and a clear understanding of the situation.\\n\\nIt is true that the CERB program was swiftly implemented with limited safeguards, which inadvertently allowed some individuals to take advantage of the generosity of Canadians. The design of the program inadvertently encouraged people to stop working, leading to reluctance in returning to work when employers called them back. As a result, they now seek to retain the funds they knowingly obtained without meeting the eligibility criteria.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is crucial to consider the context in which pandemic programs like the CERB were introduced. The government actively encouraged individuals to apply for and collect these benefits in order to ensure their safety during the pandemic. However, the rules and regulations surrounding these benefits frequently changed, causing confusion. Even today, the online resources that provide information on legacy rules contradict each other.\\n\\nIn fact, recipients of social assistance, who represent approximately 5% of Canada's population or 1 in 20 people, were legally obligated to apply for the CERB and faced penalties and sanctions if they failed to do so. Despite this requirement, pandemic benefits were generally deducted from other forms of assistance.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of these events, significant changes have been made to the rules governing pandemic benefits. Firstly, the $5,000 income threshold was limited to specific income sources outlined in the legislation, which is stricter than what had been communicated on websites. For instance, honorariums were initially considered qualifying income online, but they were not covered in the CERB legislation.\\n\\nSecondly, the requirement for individuals to receive the $5,000 rather than merely earn it has made many people ineligible, as they earned income but did not receive it due to pandemic-related business difficulties and closures. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) does not accept explanations regarding challenges in obtaining documentation of earnings, unless they are brought to tax court. Consequently, individuals who worked but did not receive income are retroactively deemed ineligible for the CERB. This rule lacks logical coherence.\\n\\nThirdly, the tax court now expects CERB claimants to provide meticulous accounting records to prove their eligibility. Failure to produce such detail often results in the denial of benefits.\\n\\nFourthly, there are no exceptions or room for judges to determine eligibility for claimants who narrowly miss meeting the criteria. Unlike other programs, pandemic benefits do not allow for flexibility or exceptional circumstances to be taken into account.\\n\\nFifthly, the hardship rules that typically apply to payment terms are being greatly restricted, leaving individuals with less leniency when facing financial challenges.\\n\\nLastly, the federal budget has allocated over $50 million to pursue low-income individuals who were found ineligible for benefits, despite the contradictory communication materials and administrative processes.\\n\\nIt is unfortunate that these challenges overshadow the noteworthy accomplishment of Canada reaching its poverty goals nine years ahead of schedule. Instead of celebrating this significant achievement, some incorrectly perceive it as a failed experiment in safeguarding our most vulnerable residents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is important to approach the issue of ineligible CERB recipients with professionalism and a commitment to readability. While it is necessary to address the misuse of funds, it is equally crucial to acknowledge the complexity and confusion surrounding the program's implementation. We must strive for fairness and thoughtfulness in evaluating the situation, ensuring that we recognize both the accomplishments and challenges faced by Canada during this unprecedented time.\"}"}

We have consistently heard that citizen engagement by the government of Canada must be genuine and meaningful. To meet this objective, we have developed a set of principles and guidelines to ensure that our engagement on policy matters is transparent, relevant, inclusive, accountable, and adaptable.\\n\\nOur journey towards establishing these principles began in 2013 when we conducted a large-scale engagement process to support the development of Canada's second action plan on open government. Through extensive conversations with Canadians, their concerns regarding meaningful engagement led us to commit to \\\"develop a set of principles and standards for public consultations in discussion with citizens and civil society.\\\" To fulfill this commitment, we first conducted an environmental scan to study global best practices. Furthermore, we organized workshops with the federal government's regulatory community, who are legally required to consult on proposed revisions or changes. We also raised the issue for discussion within the academic community at the Congress of Humanities and Social Sciences in June 2015.\\n\\nThe subsequent step involved the Canadian Open Dialogue Forum, during which we collaboratively created a set of principles with the participation of over 200 individuals from civil society, government, academia, and business. Through a two-day conference in March 2016, we engaged in lively discussions and gathered ideas and reactions, ultimately resulting in a preliminary list of 16 principles. We continued to consult, refine, and edit to ensure that both the government and our community were satisfied with a document exemplifying openness. \\n\\nThroughout the process, we recognized the importance of course correction. For instance, during the Govmaker event in 2016, we initially proposed the principle that \\\"participants should know what's on and off the table\\\" to maximize relevancy. However, upon receiving feedback from the attendees, it became evident that if the process is genuinely \\\"open,\\\" then nothing should be entirely off the table. We also acknowledged feedback regarding the perception that the principles were solely developed by the government of Canada and that the responsibility for decision-making should be shared, leading us to incorporate co-creation of engagement processes and shared accountability into the principles.\\n\\nAs a result of our collective efforts, we have established principles for engagement between the government and citizens. We are currently experimenting with their implementation in public consultations and are actively working to develop more specific guidance on implementing these principles. Additionally, we are utilizing these principles as a foundation for measuring the effectiveness of various types of public engagement activities conducted by the government of Canada.\\n\\nEnsuring effective relationships and engagement with indigenous peoples and nations remains a critical priority. In our future blog posts, we will delve into measuring the effectiveness of the principles and exploring the relationship between engagement and trust in government.\\n\\nThank you for your support, and we eagerly anticipate our continued learning journey together.\\n\\nThom Kearney\\nOn behalf of the Open Government Team\"}"}

I aim to provide insight into our role, goals, and daily activities, which extend beyond our visible work of tracking progress on mandate letter commitments and reporting outcomes.\\n\\nFirstly, we focus on assembling materials for the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Committee on Agenda, Results, and Communications. These materials, typically presented in the form of dashboards, heat maps, and concise progress reports, outline advancements in key priorities and flag areas that require attention. For instance, our reports have highlighted progress in gender-based budgeting and analysis across the system, as well as improved recruitment of underrepresented groups in Canada's uniformed and security agencies. However, we also identify areas that require further progress. Conducting stock take meetings with the Prime Minister and key leaders, supported by data, has proven instrumental in accelerating progress. As a result, there is now a clearer understanding within the public service that the Prime Minister expects the achievement of targets and rigorous gender-based analysis and budgeting for all new proposals. Our approach to publicly sharing these reports on results will be finalized soon.\\n\\nSecondly, we assist departments in developing new policy and program submissions. Our focus revolves around three fundamental questions: What are the desired outcomes? How will they be achieved? How will success be evaluated and adjustments made if needed? Typically, this involves providing guidance to departments regarding their submissions to the Cabinet, but it may also entail further examination of their programs. Recently, we have collaborated with departments as they refine their policy goals and evaluation strategies on various issues, such as homelessness reduction, expanding broadband coverage in remote and rural areas, addressing the opioid crisis, improving outcomes for job training programs, and reducing the federal government's carbon footprint.\\n\\nThirdly, we work closely with departments on a day-to-day basis to help ministers overcome obstacles to successful implementation of their initiatives within the system. Rather than allowing issues to persist, we address them promptly, directing them to the appropriate decision-making forums, and endeavor to expedite progress. In certain cases, we conduct in-depth analyses of high-priority issues that are experiencing slower progress than anticipated. This entails scrutinizing the overall delivery process, considering all partners and policies that may support or impede successful implementation. Factors may include the federal government's own procurement and contracting regulations, sluggish decision-making, or capacity constraints in partner organizations. An example of our recent involvement is the long-standing issue of boil water advisories on reserves. Through a collaborative team effort involving representatives from departments, the PCO, and communities, we are mapping out the delivery process and identifying challenges.\\n\\nThese three functions were not previously conducted systematically across the federal government. While they were occasionally undertaken in response to specific circumstances, they lacked ongoing systematic implementation. All these endeavors contribute to our larger objective of shifting the culture of the federal government towards one that prioritizes implementation issues and focuses on achieving desired outcomes. This entails investing more in individuals capable of delivering programs and projects and expanding investments in data and evaluation to determine the results achieved. Hence, \\\"Results & Delivery\\\" is not merely the name of our unit; it encapsulates our daily mission. In this blog, I will describe our activities and address the challenges encountered by the public service as we transition towards an outcomes-focused organization. In my next post, I will discuss our approach to public reporting and what the future holds.\"}"}

The development of technology and communication, along with increased public expectations, now make transparency not just a possibility, but a necessity. Open government leads to greater efficiency, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens' needs. Open data plays a significant role in this, presenting governments with a valuable opportunity to meet the growing demand for this vital resource in the 21st century. Over the next decade, data will fundamentally change the way we live, work, and think. For instance, real-time transport data apps have become commonplace in showing train and bus arrival times, and data on school and doctor performance have given citizens a greater voice and choice in public services. Just recently, Minister Francis Maude expanded the family and friends test to include the National Health Service and other public services, enabling people to provide feedback on their experiences. The potential applications of open data are limitless. The Ordnance Survey, a mapping authority, demonstrated the educational possibilities of this data by creating a map of Great Britain for the Minecraft computer game, using freely available map data from Ordnance Survey OpenData. The UK government aims to be a global leader in transparency and is already a frontrunner in open data, with over 10,000 datasets available on http:\/\/www.data.gov.uk\/. However, releasing data alone is not sufficient; it must also be accessible, user-friendly, and shareable. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of data, we must prioritize what will be of the greatest value. To achieve this, we have engaged with citizens, businesses, and civil society to identify the core data for our national information infrastructure and ensure its availability to developers and entrepreneurs, stimulating economic growth through information-led businesses. Our partnership with Canada and other international allies supports the transformative power of transparency and open government, as evidenced by the signing of the Open Data Charter during the G8 summit in Northern Ireland. The charter commits member states to make their data widely accessible in a user-friendly format and establishes the expectation that all government data be published openly by default. Both the UK and Canada are participants in the Open Government Partnership (OGP), a global initiative involving 60 countries, aimed at promoting transparency, empowering citizens, combating corruption, and harnessing new technologies. In line with this commitment, the UK and Canada will be publishing OGP national action plans in support of the Open Data Charter. We also intend to collaborate on expanding the release and utilization of open data, encouraging more countries to adopt the G8 charter and facilitating greater public sector engagement to foster innovation and growth. The theme of open data will be central to the OGP annual summit, which the UK will be hosting in the coming weeks. This event will bring together world leaders and representatives from civil society to share success stories, evaluate progress on previous transparency promises, and establish ambitious new commitments to openness. The international collaboration, exchange of best practices, and open evaluation of government progress enabled by the OGP are crucial in establishing transparency as a reliable catalyst for change. Events like the recent Google Hangout with Minister Clement provide valuable opportunities to promote transparency and open data and gather ideas and insights from a wide range of individuals. I hope that this is just the beginning and that there will be more such events to come.\"}"}

This question is not only pertinent to my role, but also to the everyday lives of all Canadian citizens. To address this, I have outlined our approach in the Government of Canada's Information Technology Strategic Plan, published in the August 2017 edition of the Public Sector Digest.\\n\\nIn this new digital era, characterized by interconnectivity, it is crucial that we completely reimagine the government's operating model. Rather than perceiving public services as solely provided by government employees linearly, we must view the government as an exponential platform where third parties can utilize available information to deliver services on behalf of the government. Currently, the government operates in an environment where information is not readily shared, partnerships are not easily cultivated, and traditional engagement approaches significantly limit our ability to serve citizens effectively.\\n\\nTo address these challenges, we released our Information Technology Strategic Plan for 2016-2020, which marks a fundamental shift in our digital approach. This plan aims to harness the potential of technology by focusing on the management of technological assets, the development of our workforce, and the governance of the enterprise across all levels of government operations. We must adapt quickly to the rapidly changing needs of our society.\\n\\nWhile we will continue investing federal funds in areas like superclusters and artificial intelligence, we must expedite the realization of these investments' benefits. We must also foster a mindset that prioritizes open government and service agendas, creating the conditions for government to operate as a platform. In the article, I suggested several ways forward, including focusing on modern engagement tools, establishing a robust technology architecture that meets citizens' expectations, adopting innovative procurement approaches, and enhancing collaboration with an expanding network of partners. All of these efforts aim to achieve a more open government.\\n\\nMost importantly, throughout the coming years, we must place people at the center of our initiatives. Our public service must embrace new approaches and digital thinking. This requires a fundamental change in our operations to adapt to both traditional needs and new realities. As the Government of Canada's CIO, I am committed to tackling this challenge and working alongside my team at the Chief Information Office to modernize the public service technology landscape for the benefit of all Canadian citizens.\"}"}

We have made significant progress in fulfilling this promise. It is essential for Canadians, as well as their elected representatives, to have access to information about the allocation and utilization of public funds. Transparency in financial matters is fundamental for representative democracy. Therefore, our government has recently implemented crucial changes to enhance clarity, transparency, and accountability in government spending.\\n\\nEvery year, the government presents its spending plans for the upcoming year through the main estimates in Parliament. Unfortunately, the main estimates have historically been prepared and presented in the House of Commons before the federal budget announcements, resulting in discrepancies and confusion. This left parliamentarians with limited information, a situation that The Globe and Mail once described as \\\"bad to the point of absurdity.\\\" However, we have effectively resolved this issue by rearranging the order in which the main estimates and the budget are presented. We have also included a budget implementation vote in the main estimates. For the first time in recent history, the main estimates, which I presented on April 16th, include 100% of the measures announced in this year's budget. This change provides parliamentarians with more accurate and detailed information, empowering them to hold the government accountable for its use of taxpayers' money. It marks a significant advancement in government accountability.\\n\\nTo achieve this, we have added a new centrally managed budget implementation vote to the existing list of centrally managed votes in the main estimates. By law, the Treasury Board, the cabinet committee responsible for allocating funds to different departments, can only assign these funds to specific new budget measures, based on the budget's comprehensive list of funding for each new spending initiative. Any use of public money beyond this framework would be unauthorized. Economists Scott Clark and Peter Devries praised Budget 2018 for its fiscal credibility, noting that it provides more detailed financial analysis and information than any budget they can recall. They suggested that critics who found the information lacking should explore the annexes for more in-depth data. Auditor General Michael Ferguson also emphasized the importance of allocating funds according to the budget's guidelines, highlighting the responsibility Parliament has entrusted to the Treasury Board.\\n\\nWith our new approach, we are showcasing to Parliament precisely where the funding for the new budget implementation vote originates in the budget and how it will be utilized. Parliamentarians can now directly trace the money from this central vote to a specific line in the budget and the main estimates. Additionally, for enhanced clarity, we will incorporate the allocations from annex 1 of the main estimates directly into the supply bill that will be voted on by parliamentarians this spring. This increased transparency is achievable due to the unprecedented level of detail provided in the budget regarding new spending measures by department. Throughout the year, we will also provide monthly online reporting and supplementary estimates to show how the Treasury Board allocates funds to departments for each specific budget measure.\\n\\nLet's consider the new women entrepreneurship strategy as an example. This initiative aims to support women entrepreneurs in growing their businesses and generating employment opportunities. Through our new monthly online reporting, Canadians can monitor the funds allocated to this strategy, broken down by federal agency, as we expand support for women in business.\\n\\nIn my ongoing efforts to reform estimates, I have engaged my fellow parliamentarians openly and constructively, participating in three previous committee appearances and another scheduled this week. These important changes to the process have significantly improved parliamentarians' oversight of government spending. I firmly believe that the result will be a more transparent and accountable government that benefits all Canadians.\"}"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" i have taught policy at the community level , to odsp and ow recipients , at foundations , for governments , agencies and volunteers . at most of these venues , i have also taught benefit design and just to make it easy on myself , i have written a deck on understanding benefit design and the 10 principles of good benefit design . the cerb and crb do not observe 4 of the ten principles and in many ways , i don\\u2019t blame the designers . i contend that all the best minds in benefit design would not have done any better . it is impossible to design such a large suite of programs without making mistakes and taking a lot of shortcuts . canada was justly lauded for the magnitude , the effective delivery and the speed at which its pandemic benefits were rolled out . when speed is one of the most important objectives , canvassing principles of effective delivery of benefits is not necessarily top of mind . but as i noted in my first entry , two wrongs don\\u2019t make a right . what you get wrong going out the door , you certainly have the opportunity to make right on appeal . that\\u2019s what the government has done for students , the self-employed and low-income seniors and that is at the heart of my objections in this series . so let\\u2019s look at the violations as the cerb and crb were blown out the door . my first principle is to align program objectives with design . the overriding program objective of pandemic benefits was to keep people safe and indoors during the early part of the pandemic . another objective was to help people who lost their jobs and who were unable to go back to work . the cerb and the crb used the $5 , 000 threshold of 2019 earnings as a proxy to provide pandemic benefits for people who suffered job loss . the cerb and crb do not meet the first principle as people whose earnings were less than $5 , 000 also suffered job loss and many were forced to keep working during the most dangerous part of the pandemic . but the amount of $5 , 000 \\u2013 at bottom -was arbitrary . the second principle is to align canadian values with design parameters . i don\\u2019t know where i would find a canadian value that stipulates that pandemic benefits should be restricted to people who earned over $5 , 000 . yes , canadians believe in helping people who have lost their jobs or we would not have ei or welfare programs . but the $5 , 000 threshold is nowhere to be found in the value ecosystem of canadians . therefore , the second design principle is not met mostly because the $5 , 000 threshold came from out of the blue . the third principle is to understand benefit structure . the cerb and crb were incredibly innovative and it\\u2019s difficult to know whether they were paid to the people who the government intended to pay . we do know that the rules kept changing after the benefit was in pay \\u2013 what counted as income \\u2013 to whom \\u2013 when and how . but it\\u2019s hard to say that the cerb and crb violate the principle of understanding benefit structure . there was simply too little time to study it . the fourth principle is perhaps the most important understanding the four elements of an income test . in the case of the cerb and crb \\u2013 the recovery or tax back rate on income is simply entirely missing . there is no on ramp or off ramp . you are either eligible or you are not . miss the threshold by even one cent and you are ineligible . add a cent and you are eligible . no other income tested benefit has no on and off ramps gis , the ccb , the cwb , all income assistance programs . the lack of on and off ramps \\u2013 even if you are designing in a hurry is a violation of a fundamental principle of design .\",\"completion\": \"I have extensive experience teaching policy at various levels, including community organizations, foundations, governments, agencies, and with volunteers. In addition to policy, I have also taught benefit design and have created a comprehensive deck outlining the 10 principles of good benefit design.\\n\\nWhile the CERB and CRB programs were commendable in terms of their scale, efficient delivery, and speed of implementation, they do fall short in adhering to four out of the ten principles of good benefit design. However, I do not blame the designers, as it is challenging to create such a large suite of programs without making mistakes or taking shortcuts.\\n\\nWhen speed is the primary objective, it is understandable that the principles of effective benefit delivery might not be the top priority. However, it is crucial to consider that correcting mistakes and addressing shortcomings is possible through appeals, as seen with the government providing support to students, self-employed individuals, and low-income seniors.\\n\\nNow, let us examine the violations present in the design of the CERB and CRB programs. The first principle involves aligning program objectives with design. In the case of pandemic benefits, the primary objective was to keep people safe and indoors during the early stages of the pandemic. Additionally, the objective was to aid those who had lost their jobs and were unable to return to work. Unfortunately, the CERB and CRB programas they do not meet this principle, as individuals who earned less than $5,000 also experienced job loss and many were forced to work during the most dangerous period of the pandemic. Moreover, the $5,000 threshold was arbitrary.\\n\\nThe second principle pertains to aligning Canadian values with design parameters. There is no Canadian value that dictates pandemic benefits should only be given to those who earned over $5,000. While Canadians believe in assisting individuals who have lost their jobs, the $5,000 threshold does not align with our values. Consequently, this principle is not met, primarily because the threshold was introduced without any justification.\\n\\nThe third principal concerns understanding benefit structure. Although the CERB and CRB programs were innovative, it is challenging to determine if they reached the intended recipients. The rules surrounding income eligibility were subject to frequent changes, making it difficult to comprehend the benefit structure. However, it is not accurate to claim that the CERB and CRB violate the principle of understanding benefit structure due to the lack of adequate time for examination.\\n\\nThe fourth principle, and arguably the most important, is understanding the four elements of an income test. This is where the CERB and CRB programs fall short, as they simply lack an on and off ramp in terms of the recovery or tax back rate on income. The eligibility for these programs is binary \\u2013 either you meet the threshold or you don't. Missing the threshold by even a cent renders one ineligible, while exceeding it by a cent makes one eligible. This absence of on and off ramps violates a fundamental principle of benefit design, even when taking into consideration the urgency with which the programs were developed.\"}"}
