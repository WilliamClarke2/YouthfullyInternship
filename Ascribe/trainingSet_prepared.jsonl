the cdc states that to fight stress during covid , young people need to recognize and address fear , stress , and behavioral changes during covid . health concerns are certainly a priority for young people as well , and excessive worry and sadness leads to trouble paying attention , trouble concentrating , and trouble focusing on activities . it is also important for young people to stay socially connected . staying socially connected through video chats , zoom , and phone calls is also a solution . but honestly , we’re all doing the best we can , and it’s very important to recognize that as we go through our days . whatever we’re going through is valid and reasonable , and above all , normal . for me , what’s helped my mental health is spending time with my girlfriend and my friends within reason , limiting how much i doomscroll , and\n\n###\n\n","completion":"  being thankful for every moment .”\n\nWhile the mental health of young adults has been impacted by covid-19 and the pandemic, the group that is suffering the most is 18- to 24-year-olds. A study recently published in Science Advances found that 62. 9 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds reported an anxiety or depressive disorder, and a quarter found they were using more than alcohol or drugs to cope with their pandemic stress. The researchers found that a quarter of the age group “seriously considered suicide” between mid-march to mid-april, and the conclusion from those findings is that young people are suffering most mentally from covid. Unfortunately, I don't find these findings that surprising. I know a lot of people struggle with covid. I'm struggling with covid, and I'm in that age range of 18- to 24-year-olds. However, claudia wallis at Scientific American Reports on More than Just the Mental Health of Youth reports that incidences of anxiety symptoms tripled and depression quadrupled in a representative sample. The most affected are people who had pre-existing mental health issues, people of color, and low-income individuals.\n\nInterestingly enough, Ettman et al. found that asian individuals saw an almost fivefold increase in depression, and some psychiatrists who talked to wallis attributed that to racism and slurs related to the asian-americans. As an asian-american, the pandemic is forcing me to confront anti-asian racism in a way I've never done so before.\n\nAccording to holman et al., young people may have been more depressed because “[they] may have had more disruption in life events during graduations, weddings, the senior year of college and of high school. all those transitions were disruptive, as well as school and social connections, which we know are very important for young people.” and the researchers also found that increased exposure to media coverage about the coronavirus led to more distress. sensationalist reports lead to more anxiety and depression, and clearly the lack of social connection also disproportionately affects young people.\n\n psychology logan jones stresses that much of the reporting these days keeps people hooked on the news cycle, and keeps people addicted to the news. As such, jones emphasizes the importance of keeping boundaries.\n\n“consuming too much of this kind of news, whether actively or passively, can be very toxic,” jones says. “the cdc also states that the mental health of young adults has been impacted socially, emotionally, and mentally. they attribute these mental health concerns to the trauma faced at a developmental age, and all hands are on deck for parents, caregivers, and other adults to support children and young people. part of that trauma is a result of changes in routines, employment, and educational challenges, a loss of security and safety, and missed significant life events. as a teacher during covid, almost all of my students say they want to return to the physical school building during covid. they report being more lonely and isolated, and can’t wait to return to see their friends and teachers again. my school is emphasizing more relationship-building activities and prioritizing mental health during lessons more than adhering to a curriculum as a result.” END"}

serotonin ( also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine ) is actually a neurotransmitter and is known as the natural ‘feel-good’ chemical . this is due to its role as a natural mood stabilizer and its ability to reduce the symptoms of depression . as such , by increasing the rate of serotonin production , sunlight acts as a natural mood booster , allowing one to feel happier while reducing the negative effects that are often associated with depression . in fact , in 2018 , a study conducted by chinese researchers found that moderate exposure to sunlight correlates to an improvement in memory and motor learning in mice . while humans might function differently from mice , this study suggests that a similar relation could be happening for us . additionally , results from another study also suggested that exposure to sunlight is associated with the cognitive decline one experiences . in this study , the researchers found that individuals with a decreased exposure of sunlight experienced a higher probability of cognitive decline . this was especially true for individuals with existing depression . sunlight and melatonin apart from serotonin , sunlight plays a key role in the release of another chemical — melatonin . however , instead of being produced when it is sunny , melatonin is produced when it is dark . the lower the light intensity , the more melatonin secreted . while serotonin is a feel-good chemical , melatonin is the natural hormone that promotes sleep in our bodies . as it becomes dark , our body secretes more melatonin in order to prepare us for sleep . this means that melatonin is essential to help us regulate our sleep cycles . however , there is evidence that suggests that shift workers who work through the night ( and as such , are less exposed to sunlight ) produce less melatonin . without this sleep producing hormone , one could possibly experience insomnia and low quality sleep from sleep disturbances . as quality sleep is key to maintaining a healthy mind , exposing yourself to sunlight can help encourage your body to create melatonin , allowing you to get a good night’s rest ( and an improved mental state ) . furthermore , normal melatonin secretion is key to maintaining our bodies’ natural circadian rhythm . as a disruption of the natural circadian rhythm is known to increase the risk of depression , going under the sun to maintain healthy levels of melatonin production could be key in helping you keep depression at bay . lack of sunlight leaves you sad with sunlight playing key roles in the creation of serotonin and melatonin , a lack of sunlight can actually lead to a condition called seasonal affective disorder ( sad ) . sad is actually a form of depression that typically affects individuals during the winter seasons ( explaining the lethargy and helplessness you might feel when winter comes ) . while sunlight is not the only factor , it is suggested that sad primarily affects individuals in winter as one is less likely to be exposed to strong sunlight . and this points to the importance of sunlight exposure . in order to help reduce the possibility of sad ( especially when it isn’t even winter yet ) , try your best to expose yourself to natural sunlight as much as possible . who knows , that might just be the key to helping you keep illnesses like sad at bay . sunlight and vitamin d apart from serotonin and melatonin , sunlight plays a key role in helping our bodies synthesize vitamin d . a fat-soluble vitamin , vitamin d promotes calcium absorption ( strengthening your bones ) while also supporting the immune\n\n###\n\n","completion":"  system . in addition . both serotonin and melatonin are important for cognitive function and mood . as both vitamins are synthesized during the day when it’s sunny outside,icker usually play a role in improved mental health . so, go outside and enjoy the sun as much as possible , it’s free, and you can do it easily .\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is no ignoring sunlight. It's the world's oldest natural supplement for our mental wellbeing, and with good reason. After all, it's citrus-iera No. 1,000 – one of the best products for your wellbeing that comes from sunshine.\n\nSunlight and serotonin experts often associate exposure to sunlight with the release of serotonin. And research has shown that sunlight is indeed linked with this neurotransmitter in an interesting way.\n\nA study conducted to find the relationship between serotonin, sunlight, and the season found that the rate of serotonin production is directly related to the prevailing duration of bright sunlight.\n\nAt the same time, as the luminosity of the sunlight increased, the rate of serotonin production also raised rapidly.\n\nMoreover, it has been reported in times that autopsy studies found higher levels of serotonin in individuals that passed away in summer than those who did in winter. This difference in serotonin level was attributed to the differing amounts of sunlight available between the two different seasons.\n\nSo… exposure to sunlight is associated with the release of serotonin.\n\nBut what does that have to do with mental health?\n\nSerotonin is actually a neurotransmitter and is known as the natural 'feel-good' chemical. This is due to its role as a natural mood stabilizer and its ability to reduce the symptoms of depression.\n\nAs such, by increasing the rate of serotonin production, sunlight acts as a natural mood booster, allowing one to feel happier while reducing the negative effects that are often associated with depression.\n\nIn fact, a study conducted by chinese researchers found that moderate exposure to sunlight correlates to an improvement in memory and motor learning in mice. While humans might function differently from mice, this study suggests that a similar relation could be happening for us. Additionally, results from another study also suggested that exposure to sunlight is associated with the cognitive decline one experiences. In this study, the researchers found that individuals with a decreased exposure of sunlight experienced a higher probability of cognitive decline.\n\nSunlight and melatonin apart from serotonin and melatonin, sunlight plays a key role in the release of another chemical — melatonin. However, instead of being produced when it is sunny, melatonin is produced when it is dark. The lower the light intensity, the more melatonin secreted.\n\nWhile serotonin is a feel-good chemical, melatonin is the natural hormone that promotes sleep. As it becomes dark, our body secretes more melatonin in order to prepare us for sleep. This means that melatonin is essential to help us regulate our sleep cycles.\n\nHowever, there is evidence that suggests thatshift workers who work through the night ( and as such, are less exposed to sunlight) produce less melatonin. Without this sleep producing hormone, one could possibly experience insomnia and low quality sleep. As quality sleep is key to maintaining a healthy mind, exposing yourself to sunlight can help encourage your body to create melatonin.\n\nFurthermore, normal melatonin secretion is key to maintaining our bodies' natural circadian rhythm. As a disruption of the natural circadian rhythm is known to increase the risk of depression, going under the sun to maintain healthy levels of melatonin production could be key in helping you keep depression at bay.\n\nSunlight and vitamin d apart from serotonin and melatonin, sunlight plays a key role in helping our bodies synthesize vitamin d. A fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin d promotes calcium absorption ( strengthening your bones) while also supporting the immune system. In addition, both serotonin and melatonin are important for cognitive function and mood. As both vitamins are synthesized during the day when it's sunny outside,icker usually play a role in improved mental health. So, go outside and enjoy the sun as much as possible, it's free, and you can do it easily. END"}

{"prompt":"as an architect and the author of a book about the psychology of creative space design , i have long wondered why contemporary creatives cluster so willingly in noisy coffee shops . granted , there’s scientific research that caffeine fuels the imagination , but doesn’t the surrounding din interfere with their ability to think creatively such that no amount of chemical stimulation can compensate for the distraction ? certainly , many eminent creatives from the past shunned clamor . consider marcel proust . to remark that the french writer was sensitive to auditory interference would be an understatement . the man was positively neurotic about it . he treated the bedroom in his paris apartment where he wrote like a sensory deprivation chamber — shutters closed , drapes drawn , the walls lined with sound-absorbing cork . it wasn’t enough . he wore earplugs too . anton chekhov was similarly beset by hypersensitivity to sound . so was fellow obsessive frank kafka , who described his condition in his signature surreal style by saying that “i need solitude for my writing not ‘like a hermit’ — that wouldn’t be enough — but like a dead man . ” sadly , by the time he got his wish , it was too late to do anything about it . the correlation between high-level inventiveness and difficulty in filtering out sensory inputs is understandable , given that open-mindedness is a hallmark of the creative personality . the problem for off-the-chart geniuses like proust , chekhov , and kafka was that their minds were a bit too open . everything got through . hence the extreme measures they took to avoid being immobilized by incoming stimuli . fig . 1 optimal noise levels for creative processing compared to other conditions . after ravi mehta , rui ( juliet ) zhu , and amar cheema ( 2012 ) . illustration by the author . from my creative space how to design your home to stimulate ideas and spark innovation . then again , most of us aren’t marcel proust . according to research data from 2012 , people generally reach peak performance under moderately noisy conditions — 70db ( decibels ) , to be precise . it just so happens that this is roughly equivalent to the chatter in a typical coffee shop or restaurant on a relatively busy day ( fig . 1 ) . as to why this is the case , the scientists who authored the study offer a theory we theorize that a moderate ( vs . low ) level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty , which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance . a high level of noise , however , reduces the extent of information processing , thus impairing creativity . translation silence isn’t as golden as it sounds . absolute noiselessness tends to focus our attention , which is helpful for tasks that entail accuracy , fine detail , and linear reasoning , such as balancing our checkbook or fixing a swiss watch . it’s less supportive of the broad , big-picture , abstract mind-wandering that leads to fresh perspectives and a creative work product . on the other hand , excessive noise overwhelms our sensory apparatus and hinders our ability to properly process information at all . in between lies the sweet spot — noise not so loud that we can’t hear ourselves think , and not so quiet that we can’t help but hear ourselves think . living room and fountain details . bellevue , washington . architecture by david coleman architecture . interior design by elizabeth stretch for stretch design . photography by paul warchol . there’s a caveat to the data , however the noise has to be white . for the record , the technical definition of white noise is noise containing multiple frequencies with equal intensities . more colloquially , the phrase refers to a constant background noise , especially one that drowns out other sounds , and which takes the form of meaningless or distracting commotion , hubbub , or chatter . why is it important that the noise be white ? because otherwise you’re prone to tune into and attempt to discern the source and meaning of the sound , which diverts too much of your conscious attention from your task to be a useful tool for diffuse thinking . how to make noise when there isn’t any how can we creative mortals who don’t care for the smell of coffee , lack the funds to construct an oceanside villa , or live in urban environments where trees are scant benefit from the finding that a particular type and level of noise can promote insights ? here are a few options to consider get the app . yes , virginia , there really is an app for everything . use the search term “noise” to bring up dozens of sound generating programs in your smartphone’s app store . you’ll also see a broad selection of metering apps for measuring decibel levels at home . some of the app companies operate websites that let you download audio files of white noise soundtracks onto your computer or play them directly through a browser . a couple of my favorite sites include raining . fm , which offers tracks simulating — what else\n\n###\n\n","completion":"  ?

( please note that links to books are affiliate links which means i’ll earn a small commission if you buy through the link with no extra cost to you . ) 1 . craft a one sentence synopsis when i begin working on a new writing project , the very first thing i do is write up a one-sentence synopsis of what my piece will be about . i do this no matter if i’m about to write a blog post , a personal essay , or even a short story . the one-sentence synopsis gives me a clear understanding of the main point of my piece and the message i’m trying to express to my readers . it acts as a guide so i don’t end up running off on tangents and going down rabbit trails . and often it can be tweaked to become a perfect title for the piece too . for example , for this article my synopsis was “my five-step process that will help readers craft captivating headlines . ” i tweaked that sentence to get my headline “a powerful five-step process for writing captivating headlines . ” now , as i said , i don’t only use the one-sentence synopsis for blog posts . i recently wrote a personal essay titled “what a museum security guard taught me about art . ” that title came straight from a one-sentence synopsis i’d crafted too . in my article here , i dive deeper into how to craft a one-sentence synopsis and share five different formulas that can help you write yours . let’s now see how to go about tweaking your synopsis in order to turn it into a powerful headline . 2 . identify your seo keyword my second step when crafting a headline for a blog post is to identify the keyword that i want my blog post to be categorized under in google searches . in blogging parlance , this is called “search engine optimization” or seo . if you have a blog and don’t bother at all about seo , you probably won’t end up reaching readers who might have found you through google . even if you’re not worried about seo , choosing a clear keyword will help people better understand what your piece is about and help you avoid titles that sound like clickbait . for example , compare the difference between titling your piece “this one habit changed my life” ( sounds a bit like clickbait ) or “how journaling in the morning changed my life” . “journaling” would be your keyword for that title . here’s how to figure out what keyword to use for your piece take a look at your one-sentence synopsis . what is your piece about ? is there a word you use multiple times in your piece to refer to your topic ? what terms might someone be searching for in google to find your piece ? search for blog posts similar to yours . what keywords are used in the titles ? 3 . tweak your headline to include specificity , curiosity , and power words once i’ve crafted my one-sentence synopsis , written my blog post , and then pinpointed my keyword , i write up a quick first draft of a headline to work with . let’s take , for example , the blog post i wrote about my two different journaling methods . a rough draft of a title might have looked like this “a peek at my two journaling methods . ” that’s not very compelling , right ? it’s time to tweak that headline to make sure it stands out and entices people to click to read the article . there are three ingredients that copywriters use to write effective headlines specificity , curiosity , and power words . first , specificity makes your headline focused and compelling . in his classic book scientific advertising , copywriter claude c . hopkins explained why “specificity” is persuasive “…[a] man who makes a specific claim is either telling the truth or a lie . people do not expect an advertiser to lie … the weight of\n\n###\n\n","completion":"  such a claim effects the reader’s decision to act on theadvertise . we’ll return to the example of the professor’s remark later on .\n\nHow to Write Captivating Headlines END"}
{"prompt":"loss aversion — how fear influences customer choice why the possibility of loss is one of the most potent psychological principles in marketing photo by kristina tripkovic on unsplash have you ever experienced fomo — the “fear of missing out” ? it’s a form of social anxiety that makes people scared they’re being left out of exciting or interesting events . it’s usually triggered by posts on social media , where it looks like the whole world is having fun without you . if you suffer from fomo , you’re not alone . a recent study found that 70% of millennials experience the fear of missing out regularly . there’s a profound psychological principle behind why people experience fomo . it’s called loss aversion , and it can be a powerful design mechanism for guiding customer choice . photo by noah silliman on unsplash what is loss aversion ? first identified by nobel prize-winner daniel kahneman , loss aversion is a psychological principle that says people will go to great lengths to avoid losing . in fact , the psychological pain of losing is twice as powerful as the pleasure of winning . because it’s so powerful , loss aversion features heavily in cognitive psychology and decision theory . it’s also one of the most effective tactics for getting customers to buy ( the other being social proof ) . a customer’s hatred of losing can take lots of forms , each with fascinating applications . how information is presented can dramatically impact what decisions people make “losses loom larger than gains . ” — daniel kahneman photo by jc gellidon on unsplash for example , a study was conducted to see if framing cancer treatments using loss aversion could improve surgery opt-in rates . the research team hypothesized that opt-in rates were related to how the options were framed . to test this hypothesis , doctors presented patients with two options . each framed surgery as a potential gain or a possible loss — the results were staggering . surgery framed as a gain “the one-month survival rate of surgery is 90% . ” surgery framed as a loss “there is a 10% chance of death in the month post-surgery . ” when framed as a gain , 84% of people chose surgery . but when framed as a loss , only 50% opted in . this simple application of loss aversion increased surgery opt-ins by 54% . ownership creates emotional bonds that people don’t want to break this principle is known as the endowment effect . it’s a psychological principle that falls under the loss aversion umbrella . in “predictably irrational , ” dan ariely describes this effect through the lens of duke university basketball . photo by jc gellidon on unsplash if you’re unfamiliar with duke basketball , all you need to know is the duke-unc game is the biggest of the year . and that it takes place in an area of the country where basketball is a religion . to score tickets to this game , students have to camp out for weeks . they then enter a lottery for a chance to win tickets . ariely reached out to students who won tickets and those who entered the lottery but didn’t win . both had invested the same amount of pain , sacrifice , time , and effort to enter the lottery . but some had won , and others hadn’t . would this affect how each group valued the basketball tickets ? the results were interesting . students who were not successful in the lottery said they’d pay an average of $170 for a ticket . but the students who did get a ticket ? when asked how much they’d sell their ticket for , they asked 170% more for their ticket — about $2 , 400 on average . the question is — why were the owners asking so much for their tickets ? the answer ? emotion . according to ariely , once someone owns a product , they begin fantasizing about their future experiences . once they create these “pre-memories” of the game , ticket-holders don’t want to lose out . so these students wouldn’t only be selling a ticket . they’d be losing out on potential memories , emotions , and good times . the lesson — the more emotions associated with a product , the more people value it .\n\n###\n\n","completion":"  it’s a powerful psychological principle that can drive customer choice . photo by CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nLoss aversion is a psychological principle that says people will go to great lengths to avoid losing, even if it means they may have to give up an enjoyable event. For example, if you have to miss a concert, you may be more likely to choose not to go if you think you'll miss out on the fun. loss aversion also plays a significant role in cognitive psychology and decision theory.

Spoiler alert: they all claimed everything is in order. The CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook participated in the virtual hearing with the House Judiciary Committee, where they were questioned about whether their respective companies use their market dominance to benefit their own financial interests. As expected, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg provided positive assessments of their platforms during their opening statements. However, the limited time allocated for questioning allowed for little additional clarification from the CEOs, who are accustomed to giving lengthy responses filled with Silicon Valley-centric rhetoric. Both Democrats and Republicans raised concerns and pressed the CEOs on various issues. Democrats focused mainly on antitrust matters, such as Amazon's treatment of third-party sellers, whether Google shows bias towards its own products in search results, Facebook's acquisition practices, and whether Apple's closed ecosystem remains problematic. Some Republicans viewed the opportunity to question the CEOs as a chance to delve into their personal interests, including allegations of Google discriminating against conservatives, Google's withdrawal from the Pentagon's JEDI project, and why certain campaign emails ended up in spam folders. The hearing, lasting over four hours, covered a wide range of topics, with some being more impactful than others. Here are a few key highlights from the hearing. The Facebook-Instagram merger: Representative Jerry Nadler accused Facebook of violating antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram in 2012, alleging that Facebook recognized Instagram as a potential threat to its dominance in the social media market. Nadler cited internal documents from Facebook to support his claim that the merger was illegal at the time. Zuckerberg acknowledged that he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. He also pointed out that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed and approved the acquisition in 2012. Zuckerberg highlighted that at the time of the merger, Instagram's future success was not certain, and he emphasized Facebook's role in contributing to Instagram's growth. Nadler disagreed, arguing that Facebook's acquisition of Instagram was precisely the type of anticompetitive action that antitrust laws were designed to prevent, and suggested that Instagram should be separated from Facebook. Threatening tactics: Nadler and Representative Pramila Jayapal both questioned Zuckerberg about his negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom before the merger. Jayapal referenced a chat where Zuckerberg mentioned Facebook's development of its own photo strategy and indicated the possibility of competition or partnership with Instagram down the line. Systrom allegedly expressed concern that Facebook would engage in destructive behavior if he didn't sell Instagram. Zuckerberg denied that it was a threat, stating that it was a standard negotiating tactic and noting that competition in the photo-sharing space was expected. Preventing imminent harm: Twitter was not present at the hearing, but its policies came up for discussion nonetheless. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg why Twitter had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg clarified that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the President's son. However, Zuckerberg explained why he believed the ban was appropriate. The video shared by Trump Jr. featured a doctor claiming that hydroxychloroquine could cure COVID-19, which is not true. While Facebook allows discussion of drug trials and personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow false claims of a cure for a disease. Zuckerberg stated that if a statement could potentially cause harm, such as someone taking a drug based on false information, Facebook would remove it to prevent imminent risk to life. Sundar Pichai also expressed agreement with this approach when questioned about YouTube's removal of the video in question. He mentioned that during a pandemic, they rely on local health authorities and the CDC for guidelines on medical misinformation that could cause harm in the real world. END"}

Drawing from personal experiences during the aftermath of the 9\/11 attacks and subsequent learnings, here are some tips to help you navigate these challenging times.\n\n1. Limit Social Media Intake: It's no secret that social media can intensify anxiety, particularly during crises. To protect your mental well-being, set a specific time limit for social media usage and take advantage of blocking features. Platforms like Twitter allow you to mute specific words, such as \"coronavirus\" or \"COVID-19,\" for a designated period, offering you a much-needed break. While it is essential to stay informed, follow reputable sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national and local news for updates. However, remember not to obsess over minute-by-minute updates, as it can be counterproductive.\n\n2. Prepare Wisely: While it's crucial to prepare for potential quarantine situations, it is equally important to do so within reason. Stock up on a two-week supply of necessities, such as canned goods, soups, pasta, rice, oats, frozen vegetables – ensuring you have enough to sustain you and your family. This sensible preparation will offer you peace of mind, allowing you to focus on more productive tasks while avoiding panic-buying behaviors.\n\n3. Foster Connections: When faced with uncertainty, connecting with loved ones is vital. Though physical meet-ups may not be advisable due to social distancing measures, alternatives like video chats and online interactions with fellow creatives can provide a sense of connection and support. Engaging with family and friends virtually and participating in online creative communities fosters a feeling of togetherness, providing a sense of normalcy and purpose during challenging times.\n\n4. Engage in Healthy Distractions: During stressful periods, it's all too easy to resort to unhealthy habits. To avoid falling into this trap, surround yourself with healthy distractions. Engage in activities that stimulate your mind and divert your attention from constant notifications. Whether it's reading good books, listening to interesting podcasts, or practicing yoga, find something that cultivates your creativity while maintaining a healthy mindset.\n\n5. Schedule Sacred Time: Carve out dedicated time for yourself each day, allowing for at least 30 minutes of solitude. If you are now working from home, take advantage of the time you've gained from eliminating your commute. Disconnect from your phone, take a walk, meditate, or engage in any activity that enables you to check-in with yourself. Embrace this time as an opportunity for self-reflection and prepare your mind for moments of inspiration and creativity. Don't burden yourself with productivity goals during this interval; instead, free your mind and enjoy the sense of freedom and clarity it brings.\n\n6. Embrace Creativity: In uncertain times, it's common to question the relevance of creative pursuits. However, it's precisely during these moments that art becomes all the more critical. Creativity reminds us of the beauty and originality that exists in the world, providing solace and a sense of order. Whether it's painting, baking a pie, or starting a podcast, the act of creation can bring joy, pride, and a temporary escape from the troubles of the world. Remember, the quality of what you create is less important than the act itself. Focus on the process and the positive impact it can have on your well-being and that of others.\n\nIn times of calm or panic, productivity is not solely measured by tangible outcomes. It also encompasses the importance of self-care, nurturing connections, and finding solace through creative expression. By implementing these strategies, you can maintain your productivity and foster a sense of calm and creativity amidst challenging times. END"}

{"prompt":"you need to show up every single day . “the most important thing about art is to work . nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying . ” — steven pressfield i used to be a master procrastinator in college . if my professor gave me a task to complete , i’d always find an excuse . i’d say it was too difficult , time-consuming , or anything else . and just like magic , someone more competent would do it for me . i enjoyed sitting on the couch . i hated going outdoors . so i guess it’s no surprise that most people considered me to be extremely lazy . the only marathon i’d ever complete was a twelve-hour binge of my favorite shows on netflix . but then the cash in my bank account began to disappear . the truth is that i wasn’t making anywhere near enough money to support my lifestyle , so i needed to improve my work ethic . the above quote from stephen pressfield changed my life forever . it made me realize that excuses are pointless . why ? because nothing amazing will happen unless you sit down and do the work . you don’t need a fancy keyboard , perfect lighting , or anything else a productivity guru might say . instead , just open your laptop , connect to the internet , and write . that’s it . each morning , i get up at approximately 7am , go to my desk , and write a new article for several hours . following this routine has helped me to remain consistent , create a daily writing habit , and generate a full-time income doing something i love . if you want to improve your creative process , consider doing the same . find somewhere quiet to work , and do your best to write something . because when you show up every day to write , the power of compound interest will create incredible results over time .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In order to achieve success, it is imperative to commit to a daily routine. Renowned author Steven Pressfield emphasizes the significance of consistent action, stating that the primary focus of any artistic pursuit is work itself. All other factors pale in comparison to the fundamental act of sitting down each day and putting in the effort. As someone who once struggled with procrastination during my college years, I can attest to the transformative power of this principle.\n\nIn the past, when faced with tasks assigned by my professors, I would always find excuses to avoid them. Whether it was claiming their complexity, time-consuming nature, or any other pretext, I readily relinquished responsibility and allowed more capable individuals to tackle the challenges on my behalf. My inclination was to bask in the comfort of my couch rather than venture outside. Consequently, it should come as no surprise that I earned a reputation as someone lacking ambition and discipline. While I could easily complete a twelve-hour Netflix binge, I was failing to generate the necessary financial resources to sustain my chosen lifestyle. I realized that a significant improvement in my work ethic was long overdue.\n\nIt was then that I stumbled upon the aforementioned quote by Steven Pressfield, which had an indelible impact on my life. It instilled in me the understanding that excuses serve no purpose. Why? Because extraordinary results can only be achieved through focused and dedicated effort. One need not be encumbered by the false notion that a flashy keyboard, optimal lighting, or any other trappings advocated by productivity experts are prerequisites for success. The formula is simple: open your laptop, connect to the internet, and begin writing. It is as straightforward as that.\n\nFollowing this revelation, I made a conscious decision to establish a daily routine. Every morning, promptly at 7 a.m., I arise from my slumber and proceed to my designated workspace. With unwavering commitment, I dedicate several hours to crafting a new article. This consistent routine has not only bolstered my discipline but has also fostered a habitual approach to writing, enabling me to augment my income substantially while engaging in a pursuit I am truly passionate about. If you desire to enhance your own creative process, I urge you to consider adopting a similar approach. Seek out a serene environment conducive to your work, and strive to produce something every day. By doing so, you will harness the power of compound interest, experiencing the gradual accumulation of remarkable results over time. END"}

artificial intelligence to generate lifelike portraits of historical figures by leveraging deep learning techniques to transform statues and paintings. The AI software incorporates attributes such as lighting and variations to enhance the clarity of the images. Additionally, the Artbreeder AI program can generate entirely new images from scratch using data points obtained from existing photos. Uterwijk has successfully produced human-like portraits of renowned individuals like Vincent van Gogh and Napoleon Bonaparte. The technology behind these creations, known as #deeplearning, enables Uterwijk to capture the essence of a statue or painting and transform it into a more human-like representation. The AI system analyzes various facial features and photographic qualities to achieve this remarkable effect. To date, Uterwijk has worked on approximately 50 to 60 AI-generated pictures, including an ongoing project focused on depicting a potential facial appearance of Anne Frank at an age she never reached.\n\nTracking AI Programs and Enhancing US Competitiveness\n\nThe United States' global competitiveness in the field of artificial intelligence is at risk due to inadequate management within the Department of Defense. To regain momentum and establish itself as a global leader in AI, it is crucial to track AI programs and promote data sharing. The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) is taking steps to develop standardized definitions and governance policies for AI implementation. By improving project management, accurately tracking AI programs, and fostering a culture of data sharing, the JAIC aims to address the shortcomings and maximize the potential of AI within the Department of Defense.\n\nMachine Learning Revolutionizes Veterans Benefits\n\nObtaining veterans' benefits can often be a complex and time-consuming process. However, the Department of Veterans Affairs is utilizing a new machine learning application called Content Classification Predictive Service (CCPS) to streamline and expedite this experience. By automating repetitive tasks that previously required manual intervention, CCPS is significantly reducing the average time needed to process veteran disability compensation claims. During its initial week of operation, CCPS automatically reviewed and established 3,994 out of 8,368 claims, eliminating the need for manual intervention in 48% of cases. This technology represents a vital step towards enhancing efficiency and accuracy in handling veteran claims, ensuring faster access to the benefits they deserve.\n\nAI Enabling Predictive Analysis for Material Interactions\n\nResearchers from MIT, the University of Washington, and the University of Toronto have developed an AI system capable of predicting physical interactions between materials like fabric by analyzing video footage. This groundbreaking technology allows the AI system to extrapolate to unseen scenarios, enabling it to make long-term predictions. The system, known as a Visual Causal Discovery Network (V-CDN), consists of three modules: one for visual perception, one for structure inference, and one for dynamics prediction. By learning from visual cues, the perception model identifies the variables governing interactions between objects. This demonstration of AI's ability to discern causation is a crucial stepping stone towards a more comprehensive understanding of counterfactual reasoning.\n\nExpanding AI Research through the National Research Cloud\n\nMajor universities and tech companies are advocating for increased government support in AI research to enhance national security and economic competitiveness. The National Research Cloud, a collaborative initiative with bipartisan support, has gained approval from universities including Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and Ohio State University. It also includes the participation of major tech companies such as Amazon, Google, and IBM. The project aims to grant academics access to tech companies' cloud data centers and public datasets, thereby fostering innovation and growth in AI research. Although funding for other research areas has been reduced, the Trump administration has proposed doubling spending on AI by 2022.\n\nAI-Enabled Robots Revolutionize Last-Mile Delivery and Waste Recycling\n\nRefraction AI's last-mile delivery robot, the REV-1, has witnessed a surge in demand for lunch delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This contactless delivery option has become increasingly popular as it offers a safe and efficient solution for urban communities. Similarly, AI-enabled robotics are transforming the recycling industry as companies seek to enhance processing capabilities due to China's restrictions on imported recyclable waste products. By leveraging computer vision, neural networks, and modular robotics, AI can accurately identify and sort recyclable materials based on visual cues such as logos, color, shape, and texture. This technology is particularly effective at identifying smaller items that may not typically be recycled, such as coffee pods.\n\nAddressing Ethical Considerations in AI\n\nThe Montreal AI Ethics Institute has published its inaugural State of AI Ethics report, focusing on key developments and challenges in the field. The report addresses issues of bias in ranking and recommendation algorithms, emphasizing the need to approach diversity from a cultural and contextual perspective. One proposed solution involves using a framework that takes into account subjective categories derived from diverse individuals rather than rigid, predefined categories. The report also highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in AI systems and advocates for the development of effective policies to govern AI ethics.\n\nProactive Steps for Ethical AI Implementation\n\nResearchers from the University of Warwick, Imperial College London, EPFL (Lausanne), and Sciteb Ltd. have developed a mathematical approach to help manage and mitigate biases in AI systems that could lead to unethical decision-making. As AI systems play an increasingly significant role in commercial settings, including pricing strategies, there is a growing need to understand and address the potential for unethical choices. Through comprehensive modeling and analysis, this research aims to identify circumstances in which AI systems might adopt unethical strategies and develop methods to reduce or eliminate these risks.\n\nPrinceton University Spearheading Data Science Initiatives\n\nPrinceton University is leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning in interdisciplinary research through the Schmidt DataX Fund. This enterprise, made possible by a significant gift from Schmidt Futures, aims to enhance the impact of data science across various disciplines. By integrating machine learning and AI into research efforts, Princeton hopes to enable researchers across different fields to incorporate data science techniques into their work more effectively. The fund will support the development of graduate-level courses, training programs, and workshops to equip researchers with essential skills and tools required for data science proficiency.\n\nRobotic Solutions for COVID-19 Sanitization\n\nMIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, in collaboration with Ava Robotics and the Greater Boston Food Bank, has developed a robot equipped with ultraviolet (UV) light to sanitize surfaces and neutralize coronavirus particles in the air. This autonomous robot, fitted atop an Ava Robotics base, has the potential to navigate spaces independently in the future. During tests at the Greater Boston Food Bank's warehouse, the prototype robot effectively neutralized 90% of coronaviruses on surfaces within 30 minutes, even reaching into hard-to-access areas. This technology presents a promising solution for effectively sanitizing high-traffic areas and reducing the risk of COVID END"}

Random mutations that alter the wiring of neurons can lead to changes that improve the chances of producing offspring, thereby spreading throughout the population.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that evolution does not concern itself with the implications for textbooks or the attachments we place on specific brain regions. Our understanding of the brain's functions often comes from studies where certain areas are removed or deactivated. While observing deficits in particular behaviors when a specific area is damaged may lead to assumptions regarding its role, it is crucial to recognize that behavior is not completely eradicated but rather impaired. The brain possesses redundancy, akin to a vast collection of interconnected cells, allowing it to continue functioning albeit not as efficiently.\n\nFurthermore, it is fallacious to equate impairments resulting from brain damage to a definitive understanding of the functionality of the damaged area. Discovering that damaging a specific region causes problems merely illustrates that this region plays a role in said functionality. This reasoning should not surprise us, as we have essentially removed a portion of the brain. \n\nTo demonstrate this logical fallacy, one can make a prediction about the functionality of the mouse brain. For instance, the ventrolateral medulla may be proclaimed as vital for mice to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food. However, removing the ventrolateral medulla would result in the mouse's death because this area controls the breathing rhythm, which is essential for survival. Therefore, the absence of learning in this scenario would be attributed to the mouse's demise rather than a specific role of the ventrolateral medulla in learning. \n\nMoreover, it is intriguing when the removal of certain brain regions has no noticeable effect. Cutting out portions before learning can slow down or worsen the learning process, but if removed after learning, no apparent consequences arise. These redundant brain areas demonstrate the large capacity within the brain to compensate and solve problems in various ways. \n\nOccasionally, unexpected findings pique considerable excitement among researchers, such as reward-induced changes in primary visual cortex activity or the encoding of sound in the hippocampus. While these studies are noteworthy and fascinating, becoming surprised by such occurrences falls into the trap of assigning undue significance to the names we have bestowed upon specific clusters of neurons. Evolution is oblivious to our labels; it merely perceives the brain as an intricate interconnection of neuron clusters. END"}
{"prompt":"this article is not intended to be a rant against the news media or facebook . as i try to do with all my writing , i just want to suggest the possibility of a different perspective . i also want to present some data that supports my differing perspective . my hypothesis about the current state of malaise and despair that we see so often around us is this we have little to fear , but much about which to be anxious . to repeat we have little to fear , but much about which to be anxious . according to the american psychology association , fear and anxiety are two distinct mental states , caused by and causing different things fear n . a basic , intense emotion aroused by the detection of imminent threat , involving an immediate alarm reaction that mobilizes the organism by triggering a set of physiological changes . these include rapid heartbeat , redirection of blood flow away from the periphery toward the gut , tensing of the muscles , and a general mobilization of the organism to take action ( see fear response fight-or-flight response ) . fear differs from anxiety in that the former is considered an appropriate short-term response to a present , clearly identifiable threat , whereas the latter is a future-oriented , long-term response focused on a diffuse threat . to summarize , fear is an immediate alarm response to a real or perceived threat , which causes a distinct action . anxiety is a long-term emotion which focuses not on a particular immediate threat , but a diffuse threat or threats that may or may not materialize , and which may or may not have a good response . there are those among us who have good reason to fear the coronavirus . and there are those with good reason to fear the economic meltdown going on right now . but i would argue that the state of confusion , panic and despair that we see so prevalent around us is not caused by fear , but anxiety . fear is a clean emotion . it comes , serves it’s purpose , and departs . fear is a survival instinct . using myself as an example , i am afraid of snakes . if i happen across one on a walk in the woods , i will immediately back up , get a safe distance before turning my back , and then run like hell until i feel safe again . that is fear . i do not spend all day everyday wondering if i will encounter a snake , and dreading going out because there might be a snake in my path today . that is anxiety . and that’s what we’re dealing with in the world today . if anything , i would argue that it would probably be a good thing if more people feared the coronavirus , because then they would be compelled to comply with social distancing and quarantine guidance . if more people truly feared the economic crisis , they would act to shore up their family’s wellbeing , they would make financial sacrifices before the next panic comes , and they would ensure they had a safety net in place . but we are not truly afraid of these things , merely anxious . and as a result we do nothing , make no changes , learn no lessons , and so are doomed to repeat the same societal mistakes ad nauseum . maybe , if we were more afraid and less anxious , we could put systems in place to provide better outcomes in the future . unfortunately , in addition to our own human tendency to lethargy and torpor , we also have to contend with a gigantic media establishment that feeds off of anxiety and keeping us trapped in a haze of confusion and inaction . we see evidence of this in the way we have systemically turned away from any kind of journalistic standard in news and prefer to get our information from bloggers , facebook and twitter influencers . somehow , we’ve been conditioned to believe that we will hear the unvarnished truth from our “friends” on the internet , and never question whether or not these so-called “friends” might not have an even more ingrained agenda than mainstream media does . we are fed a constant stream of anxiety-fueling hot takes , breaking reports and opinion pieces disguised as news , much of it blatantly contradictory and even downright false , and we wonder why we can’t ever seem to feel any peace or confidence , in ourselves , our neighbors , and our social institutions . perhaps , as franklin roosevelt famously said , “the only thing we have to fear , is fear itself . ” because what’s eating america and the rest of the world from the inside out is not a clean , healthy survival instinct . it is a toxic , cancerous anxiety that is perpetuated by ourselves , that stops us in our tracks and renders us powerless in the face of some pretty fearful things . to get better , we have to start by being more afraid , of the right things , to be afraid of inaction , to be afraid of a lack of preparation . to be afraid of paralyzing anxiety . only then can we turn and begin to make changes to improve our safety and security . for so long as we live in anxiety as a society , we will never be safe .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This article is not intended to criticize the news media or Facebook. Instead, it aims to offer a different perspective. The goal is to present data that supports this shift in viewpoint. \n\nMy hypothesis regarding the prevalent state of unease and despair in society is that we have little to fear but much to be anxious about. It is important to distinguish between fear and anxiety, as they are distinct mental states with different causes and effects.\n\nFear is an intense emotion triggered by the perception of an immediate threat. It mobilizes the body for action through physiological changes like increased heart rate, redirected blood flow, muscle tension, and overall readiness to respond. Fear is a short-term response to a present and identifiable threat.\n\nIn contrast, anxiety is a future-oriented, long-term response. It is characterized by a diffuse sense of threat that may or may not materialize, and it lacks a clear course of action. Anxiety focuses on potential dangers that may or may not have effective solutions.\n\nWhile some individuals have genuine reasons to fear the coronavirus or economic downturn, the confusion, panic, and despair we often witness are predominantly driven by anxiety rather than fear. Fear is a transient emotion that serves its purpose and subsides. For example, if I encounter a snake during a walk in the woods, I will immediately react to ensure my safety. However, I will not spend every day dreading the possibility of a snake encounter, as that would be anxiety.\n\nIn fact, it could be beneficial if more people genuinely feared the coronavirus because it would lead to greater compliance with social distancing and quarantine measures. Similarly, if more individuals truly feared the economic crisis, they would take proactive steps to secure their family's well-being and establish financial safety nets. However, our response is typically characterized by anxiety, resulting in inaction, unchanged behaviors, and a failure to learn from past mistakes.\n\nIf we were more driven by fear and less by anxiety, we could implement systems that yield better outcomes in the future. Unfortunately, apart from our natural tendency towards complacency, we also have to contend with a media establishment that thrives on perpetuating anxiety and keeping us in a state of confusion and passivity.\n\nWe observe this trend in the way we have turned away from traditional journalistic standards and increasingly rely on bloggers, social media influencers, and unverified sources for information. We mistakenly believe that these online acquaintances provide unbiased truth, without questioning if they may have their own underlying agenda.\n\nWe are bombarded by anxiety-inducing hot takes, breaking news reports, and opinion pieces masquerading as factual information. Much of this content is contradictory or even false, leaving us constantly unsettled, lacking confidence in ourselves, our neighbors, and our societal institutions.\n\nAs Franklin Roosevelt famously stated, \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" What plagues America and the world is not a healthy survival instinct; it is a toxic anxiety that paralyzes us in the face of genuine threats. To overcome this, we must start by focusing on the right things to fear, such as inaction and a lack of preparedness. We should be afraid of the paralyzing grip of anxiety.\n\nOnly then can we begin to make the necessary changes to ensure our safety and security. As long as we remain a society engulfed in anxiety, true safety will continue to elude us. END"}

As writers, we understand the importance of creating headlines that stand out and attract readers. However, resorting to clickbait techniques is not the solution. Seductive and misleading headlines may initially draw in readers, but they ultimately result in a sense of betrayal and waste of time. As a result, reputable media sites have recognized the detrimental effects of clickbait on their credibility and have taken steps to avoid such practices.\n\nClickbait headlines are characterized by their deceptive and tantalizing nature, which tempts readers to click on the link by using teasing language or intentionally vagueness. These headlines have been a significant issue in journalism, leading to concerns about the value and integrity of news content. In fact, back in 2015, one of the UK's major newspaper publishers, Trinity Mirror, considered setting \"click\" targets for their reporters. However, these plans were abandoned due to the realization that this approach would diminish the credibility of news by flooding it with fluff and sensationalism.\n\nReputable media sites, such as BBC News, The Guardian, The New York Times, Time, NBC News, and CBC, understand the importance of maintaining credibility and serving their readers. They actively avoid clickbait techniques, as they recognize that such practices damage their brand and the trust their audience has in their content. Learning from these sites provides valuable insights into how to write professional headlines that engage readers without resorting to clickbait.\n\nWriting effective headlines is an art, one that can be honed by identifying common characteristics shared by reputable media sites. By studying the headlines of these trusted sources, we can learn to craft compelling and informative headlines that genuinely attract readers. Remember, our goal as writers is to provide valuable and reliable information to our audience, not to lure them in with false promises or empty content. By adopting a professional tone and focusing on delivering quality content, we can build trust with our readers and establish ourselves as reputable voices in the digital landscape. END"}

with search engines . search engines understand variations of keywords , and it’s unnecessary and counterproductive to stuff every version of your keyword into a title . according to moz’s testing and experience , keywords closer to the beginning of your title tag may have more impact on search rankings . in addition , user experience research shows that people may scan as few as the first two words of a headline . this is why they recommend titles where the most unique aspect of the page ( e . g . the product name ) appears first . avoid titles like brand name | major product category —

descriptive , so we recommend descriptions between 50–160 characters . a page’s meta description should intelligently ( read in a natural , active , non-spammy way ) employ the keywords that page is

While earning money from the Medium Partner Program is a bonus, the primary goal is to generate significant traffic for their Medium stories. Medium has a high domain authority, which means that content published on the platform is given preferential treatment by search engines. This creates the potential for a large amount of external traffic to Medium articles.\n\nFor instance, I wrote an article titled \"How to Bypass Virtually Every News Paywall,\" which received over 100,000 views. This article addressed a popular online question and leveraged Medium's high domain authority to attract search engine traffic. The majority of the views came from external sources, with Google alone generating over 80,000 views. Even less common search engines like DuckDuckGo contributed over 1,000 views. It is important to note that achieving optimal ranking in search engines takes time, often weeks or even months.\n\nAs shown in the screenshots of my Medium article analytics, the traffic initially surged a few days after publication, remained flat for over a month, and then gradually climbed from being overlooked to becoming accessible in search engine results. The article was also quickly indexed by Google due to Medium's domain authority and the initial surge of traffic it received. Even several months after publication, the traffic continues to grow steadily, with approximately 1,000 views per day.\n\nThe growth in views is primarily attributed to the article's increasing page rank on Google's search engine. It started from the bottom of the first page, moved to the number one spot on page 1, and eventually became the featured snippet (position 0) in Google's search results.\n\nTo optimize the search engine performance of a Medium article, it is essential to focus on several \"on-page\" factors: the title, subheadings, meta description, URL, content, and image tags. Each of these fields should be optimized with a target keyword to attract external views.\n\nThe title should be accurate, concise, and preferably under 60 characters. Avoid titles that are just a list of keywords or repetitive variations of the same keyword. Research suggests that keywords closer to the beginning of the title tag have more impact on search rankings. It is also important to consider user experience and create titles where the most unique aspect of the page appears first.\n\nSubheadings play a significant role in capturing and holding the reader's attention. They should be useful, unique, ultra-specific, and able to create a sense of urgency.\n\nThe meta description, displayed in search results, should be between 50-160 characters and intelligently employ target keywords while also creating a compelling description for the searcher to click.\n\nA well-crafted URL provides an indication of what the destination page is about and can act as anchor text when shared in online venues. Keyword use in the URL can also impact search rankings.\n\nContent should be engaging and of high quality, avoiding duplicate content and keyword-stuffed copywriting. A defined content strategy is crucial for effective digital marketing.\n\nKeyword research should be done before writing to focus on topics or niche keywords that people are already searching for.\n\nKnowing where and how to use keywords within the content is important for maximum search visibility.\n\nOrganizing the content in a logical way helps both SEO and visitor experience by facilitating easy navigation to related content.\n\nPromoting content through sharing on social networks and building both internal and external links can increase visibility.\n\nMedium now allows proper image tagging with alt-text functionality. Visual content should be considered to cater to the audience's preference for finding answers through images.\n\nThese optimization techniques can help writers generate significant external traffic to their Medium articles and maximize their visibility in search engine results.

Interacting with others can drain their energy, while being by themselves revitalizes it. Writing, being a solitary and introspective activity, naturally attracts introverts. We thrive when working alone. Some of us may have a slight ambivert side, enjoying some social interaction, but for the most part, we find it arduous to engage in the more extroverted aspects of the writing profession. Yes, I'm referring to marketing. Ugh, marketing. It's a challenging endeavor for everyone, but particularly for introverts. Every now and then, we may come across someone who has serendipitously found success without extensive marketing efforts, and they nonchalantly brush it off, saying, \"I don't like marketing, so I simply don't do it. I don't think it's necessary.\" Frankly, it's frustrating. Metaphorically, of course, because violence is never the solution. But really, come on. Only one percent of writers strike gold by writing the right thing, at the right time, and getting it in front of the right people. They become rich and famous without investing much effort into marketing. How fortunate for them. However, relying on becoming one of those exceptional cases is not a reliable career plan. It's akin to aspiring to be an actress by hanging out in soda shops, hoping for a Lana Turner-like discovery. I genuinely wish that those who stumble upon the enchanted path of success would acknowledge that it's highly unlikely for anyone else to replicate their journey. Unfortunately, it won't work for the majority of writers. Ninety-nine percent of us must learn the art of marketing, even if we're introverts who'd rather consider a career in accounting than promote our own work.\n\nNow, let me share some insights on marketing that can help alleviate your apprehensions. First and foremost, marketing is just a conversation between you and your readers. If you can remember this, it will help ease your fear. It's not a mysterious trick, technique, or strategy; it's a simple conversation. It involves reaching out to readers who are genuinely interested in your writing and informing them about a piece of work that might pique their interest. That's all there is to it, and it's not as intimidating as it seems. When you share a link on social media, you're not bothering anyone. You're providing others with the opportunity to read something they might enjoy. If they're not interested, they'll simply scroll past. No harm done. Trust me, they'll scroll, just as you scroll past countless links every day, maybe even thousands. When you run an ad, you're connecting with people who are similar to you. You're not forcing your work upon them or being pushy and obnoxious. You're merely doing what you're supposed to do—letting readers know that you've created something for them. Furthermore, if you execute it correctly, you're targeting readers who have expressed an interest in your genre or topic, not bombarding everyone and anyone. So take a deep breath and understand that marketing is part of your job, and it's perfectly acceptable to engage in it. Remember, readers are just people, like you and me. In fact, the readers you most want to reach are likely similar to you. Your book is an extension of your own literary preferences; if you enjoy it, chances are others like you will too. If you spend a moment considering how someone who has written a book like yours could reach you, it might offer some valuable insights. What would make you want to read your own book? What compels you to recommend a book to a friend? What encourages you to click on a link instead of scrolling past it? What motivates you to share it? \n\nMarketing has garnered a negative reputation due to its heavy-handed and aggressive approach by many individuals. However, I want to emphasize that marketing is more akin to a post-it note than a sledgehammer. Nobody wants to be forcefully bombarded, but everyone appreciates finding the exact right thing in the right place when they need it. As introverts, we struggle to be sledgehammers; all we want is to go home and slip into our pajamas. We have no interest in hitting anyone over the head with our books or anything else. However, we can leave a small reminder in the right place, a friendly note that says, \"Oh hi! I wrote this thing. I think you'll love it.\" The sledgehammer is easily ignored, as we're accustomed to dodging them. But those sticky notes, when used correctly, can be wonderful. They grab attention without being invasive. Don't resort to being slimy. This should be obvious, but unfortunately, it's not. There are countless individuals out there willing to take your money to teach you slimy marketing tactics. But you don't need to resort to trickery to sell your book. You don't need to sneak in under the radar or artificially boost your status. Authenticity is invaluable and your most powerful asset. When you do spend money, make it count.

The best investment you can make as a writer is in a reliable email service provider. I personally recommend ConvertKit. Start building your email list today. I have written extensively about email list building for writers, and you can find valuable information to get started. Bryan Harris at Growth Tools (formerly VideoFruit) also provides a wealth of incredible ideas for building an email list at no cost.\n\nNow, let's talk about blogging. As a writer, words are your currency and your most readily available tool. It may seem obvious, but yes, you should start blogging. If you're a novelist, you might only deliver a book to your readers once a year, give or take. However, with a blog, you can reach out to your readers anytime you wish – every week, every day, whenever you have an idea. It allows you to have an ongoing conversation with them, which is undeniably exhilarating. Trust me, if you provide your readers with a way to follow you, you'll discover that some of them are your most devoted supporters. They consistently show up for you, eagerly reading everything you write. And if you have any doubts about whether your introverted self needs this, let END"}

Therefore, I have decided to provide a brief guide on how to do so. The main question is whether Medium allows forms behind the paywall. I reached out to Medium for clarification, and they responded affirmatively. This means that, even if your Medium post includes an Upscribe form, you can still receive payment through the Medium Partnership Program.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Medium's guidelines state they aim to provide a reading experience free of advertisements. Consequently, it is possible for Medium to remove your post from the partnership program if they deem it too promotional. Therefore, use forms sparingly to avoid the risk of your post losing its place behind the paywall and not receiving payment. Although forms are allowed, curated posts that include forms are not as widely distributed by Medium compared to those without forms.\n\nTo add forms to your Medium posts using Upscribe, follow these steps:\n\n1. Sign up for Upscribe, which offers a free version with limited form views or a paid version with more views and integration with your email server.\n2. Integrate Upscribe with your email server by selecting the \"Integrate\" option and following the provided instructions.\n3. Once integrated, you can set Upscribe to connect directly to your email server. This eliminates the need to manually upload new subscribers to your email list.\n4. Click on \"Create New Form\" to begin designing your form. Upcribe provides an intuitive interface that allows you to customize the wording and design. Remember to save when you're done.\n5. To post your form directly on Medium, copy the link provided by Upcribe and paste it where you want the form to appear in your Medium post by hitting the Enter key. The form will be automatically populated.\n6. Alternatively, you can hyperlink text in your Medium post to a form that will open in a new tab. To do this, highlight the text and click on the link symbol that appears. Then, insert the link copied from Upscribe.\n\nNow, you're ready to build your email list using Upcribe on Medium. Good luck!

While we are all aware of the significance of sleep for our mental health, let us delve into the numbers. A fascinating discovery revealed in the book \"Sleeping Well\" suggests that obtaining sufficient sleep can elevate one's learning capacity by an astounding 20% to 40% when compared to those grappling with sleep deprivation.\n\nAlas, recognizing one's status as sleep-deprived can be challenging for individuals who have been enduring long-term sleep deficiencies. Astonishingly, a mere shortfall of one hour of sleep per night over the course of ten consecutive nights can result in a level of impaired performance analogous to that of an inebriated individual. This alarming revelation pertains not only to critical areas such as driving and reaction time but also to the fundamental processes of learning. It is disheartening to acknowledge the stark reality that numerous individuals, particularly students, routinely experience such a deprived state of sleep, rendering it even more crucial to address the implications of this phenomenon.\n\nBut how exactly does sleep optimize the learning process? At the crux of this scientific marvel lies the mechanics of memory consolidation within our brains. As we absorb new information throughout the day, these memories primarily find their temporary abode in the hippocampus – a brain region with a comparatively limited capacity for storage. It is during our slumber that these memories undergo a transformative journey; they either transition from the hippocampus to the neocortex – an expansive region equipped with substantially greater storage capabilities – or they are discarded altogether. For a more comprehensive understanding, refer to the concept of memory consolidation on Wikipedia.\n\nRegrettably, an insufficient amount of sleep impairs the comprehensive emptying of the hippocampus, leading to inadequate memory consolidation. Consequently, this impediment hampers our ability to absorb and retain new information effectively. The significance of obtaining a good night's sleep becomes abundantly clear when examining its profound impact on our productivity. In a hypothetical scenario, if offered a choice between earning $80,000 annually while adhering to standard working hours and enjoying ample sleep, versus obtaining $140,000 but succumbing to grueling work hours and a mere 6 hours of sleep each night, which would you opt for? While the majority might be inclined towards the latter, the book reveals a truly noteworthy notion. It posits that, in the long run, one can achieve the best of both worlds – earning $140,000 alongside ensuring sufficient sleep each night. This assertion rests on the understanding that quality sleep equates to reduced errors, heightened creativity, and an overall improvement in performance. These benefits, undoubtedly, extend to the realm of studying and learning new concepts. Therefore, the imperative becomes clear: we mustn't prioritize quantity over quality when it comes to our sleep.\n\nFor those eager to embark on a journey towards enhancing their sleep quality, it may be of interest to know that Bill Gates has reviewed the aforementioned book and imparted valuable tips on this very subject. His recommendations serve as a valuable resource for anyone seeking to improve their sleep quality.\n\nIn conclusion, the transformative power of sleep in facilitating learning is undoubtedly a revelation that deserves our attention. By recognizing and embracing the importance of obtaining sufficient and high-quality sleep, we can unlock our innate potential and elevate our overall learning capabilities. END"}

Published in the journal npj Schizophrenia, the researchers developed a new machine learning methodology to accurately measure the semantic richness of conversational language, a known indicator for psychosis.\n\nThe study found that individuals at risk for psychosis often use words associated with sound more frequently than the average population. This finding is significant as abnormal auditory perception is a pre-clinical symptom of psychosis. Surprisingly, trained clinicians had not previously noticed this pattern in language use. By analyzing two language variables - more frequent use of sound-associated words and speaking with low semantic density or vagueness - the automated analysis predicted the later development of psychosis with an impressive 93 percent accuracy.\n\nThis study demonstrates that machine learning techniques can detect patterns in language use that may elude even doctors with specialized training in diagnosing and treating individuals at risk of psychosis. First study author, Neguine Rezaii, a fellow in the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, likens the challenge of identifying these subtle language nuances to \"trying to see microscopic germs with your eyes.\" She goes on to explain that machine learning acts as a \"microscope for warning signs of psychosis.\"\n\nThe research team established \"norms\" for conversational language using machine learning. For this purpose, they input the online conversations of 30,000 users from the social media platform Reddit into a software program called Word2Vec. This program utilizes an algorithm to assign each word a vector based on its meaning, positioning words with similar meanings closer together. The researchers also developed a computer program to analyze the semantic density of word usage, referred to as \"vector unpacking.\" They used this program to quantify the amount of information packed into each sentence.\n\nTo test the efficacy of their methodology, the researchers applied the same techniques to diagnostic interviews conducted by trained clinicians as part of the multi-site North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS), funded by the National Institutes of Health. The automated analyses of the participant's language samples were compared to both the normal baseline sample and longitudinal data on the participants' conversion to psychosis.\n\nThis research not only sheds light on mental illness but also provides valuable insights into how the mind works. Senior author, Phillip Wolff, a professor of psychology at Emory University, concludes that this study has important implications beyond mental health.\n\nOverall, the findings from this study showcase the potential of machine learning in uncovering hidden patterns in language that can serve as early indicators of psychosis, allowing for more timely identification and intervention.

It can refer to minding your own business and focusing solely on your own pursuits, or it can suggest remaining within the boundaries of a specific field or specialization. While this notion may resonate with some, it can also be somewhat constricting. Personally, I find comfort in the freedom that writing offers, allowing me to explore a multitude of topics without restrictions. Just as esteemed author Neil Gaiman has successfully tackled a wide range of genres and themes, why shouldn't I be able to do the same? Although there may be potential drawbacks, such as a narrower readership or lower financial rewards, if I derive satisfaction from the process and gain knowledge or establish myself in new areas, it is a worthwhile endeavor. As writers, we can strike a balance between maintaining a niche or specialty while still embracing opportunities to venture beyond our comfort zone. The key lies in understanding our own lanes, so that we can pursue new avenues on our own terms. For non-fiction writers, this may involve identifying the topics they regularly write about with authority and expertise. If uncertainty persists, or for aspiring writers, asking essential questions such as what they excel at, what they can teach others, what people seek their guidance on, and what subjects they dedicate their time and passion to can help determine their lanes. Another method to identify one's lane is seeking feedback from others by posting inquiries on social media. Although initially uncomfortable, this approach can provide insightful responses. Additionally, analyzing blog post analytics, considering the ones that attract the most traffic and reader engagement, and reflecting on personal enjoyment while writing them can also indicate one's lane. After all, none of this matters if we are not having fun along the way. It is crucial to remember that our lane is the one we genuinely desire to be in, even if we are not currently experts in that specific area. This principle applies equally to fiction writers, who may encounter challenges when writing works that do not align with their passions. Falling into the trap of pursuing a subject purely out of impatience can impede progress. Many writers embark on a path, only to quickly change course when faced with challenges or unsatisfactory results. However, this behavior often leads to a pattern of starting anew without making substantial progress towards a specific goal. To bring to mind the example of Neil Gaiman, he initially focused on honing his craft in a chosen area before branching out into different genres. This demonstrates the importance of steadfastness and dedication in achieving expertise. Rather than completely changing lanes due to impatience or disappointment, deliberately transitioning into new lanes can be a more effective approach. Starting within your primary lane, the one you ardently love, occasionally branching out into complementary \"shoulder lanes\" that relate to your existing topic can be a fruitful strategy. These tangential subjects may not correspond precisely but still allow for creative exploration without straying too far. For instance, if writing about marketing is your primary focus, writing about middle-grade fiction could be considered a shoulder lane. Occasionally, delving into unrelated topics such as personal experiences or creative endeavors outside your lane can be beneficial. Although these posts may yield less traffic compared to those within your expertise, they offer valuable benefits. Deviating from your primary lane keeps your skills sharp, necessitates research in unfamiliar territory, prompts fresh ways of thinking, and enables surprising connections between different lanes. Overall, embracing such diversions can invigorate the creative spirit and provide a refreshing change of pace. END"}

chester bennington . chester was the lead singer of linkin park , my favorite band as a kid , and the lead behind my favorite songs that would play over and over again on my ipod “numb” and “in the end . ” i was in japan , working in an organic chemistry lab , but at the time , the news devastated me — chester had died on july 20 , 2017 , by suicide . but i had grown enough in my mental health awareness that i feared the media reporting and a possible contagion effect from that reporting . according to gunn et al . in a 2018 study in the archives of suicide research , widely publicized suicides like robin williams ( 2014 ) and aaron hernandez ( 2017 ) were associated with increased google . com\/trends data on “how to suicide” and “suicide prevention . ” the authors attributed the increase in searches following williams’s death to the werther effect , a spike of emulation or copycat suicides after a widely publicized suicide , and the death of hernandez to the papageno effect , an increase in awareness and support in suicide prevention . the contagion effect is synonymous with the werther effect . the werther effect , according to blogger alexa moody , was coined in the late 1700s after johann wolfgang von goethe’s book , the sorrows of young werther . in the book , the protagonist , werther , finds himself in a love triangle and believes the only way to make it out is through suicide — although the book was widely commercially successful , the success of the book led to many copycat suicides of fans of goethe deciding to take their own lives as well . the papageno effect is on the opposite side of the spectrum . its etymology is after a character mozart’s “the magic flute , ” where a character loses his love and plans suicide as a result . the attempt is stopped last minute by three boys who support him and tell him there are alternatives to suicide and is a positive effect the media can have on suicide . when chester bennington died , suicide experts feared a contagion effect . zach schonfeld in newsweek reports that bennington’s death shocked people since many believe that wealthy and successful people don’t struggle with depression and anxiety , like other people . but depression is a disease that can affect anyone . in the words of theresa buhse , the associate executive director of the long island crisis center “just because somebody is rich and famous does not necessarily mean that they’re happy at all…the truth is , we never know what is going on in somebody’s mind . people struggle with mental illness . people struggle with depression . it doesn’t matter how rich they are . it doesn’t matter how famous they are . we don’t know what’s going on . ” chester’s death was its own example of the contagion effect . chester died on what would have been cornell’s 53rd birthday , and cornell also died by suicide years earlier . buhse notes that it might have been a coincidence , but people also may plan out an emotionally significant date . celebrity suicides sometimes have a contagion effect on the general population as well . when marilyn monroe died from probable suicide in 1962 , the suicide rate jumped by 12 percent compared to the same months the previous year . to this day , the death of marilyn monroe resulted in the most copycat suicide attempts . according to margot sanger-katz in the new york times , the publicity surrounding suicide has been linked with subsequent increases in suicide , especially for young people . analysis suggests that at least five percent of youth suicides are influenced by contagion . what irresponsible media coverage does is harm people already vulnerable and at risk for suicide . for the media to avoid the contagion , sanger-katz notes that suicide prevention advocates want news media coverage to avoid emphasizing or glamorizing suicide or make it seem like an inevitable solution for people at risk . media reports also should not fixate on graphic details of the death , and in the case of chester , one media source prominently highlighted his method of suicide . 1962 is very different from 2020 , and the media has come a long way in being responsible and diligent . schonfeld talks about the suicide of kurt cobain in 1994 , where experts feared a nationwide copycat effect . however , media outlets reported warning signs and provided hotline numbers , and the number of suicides in the seattle region decreased after cobain died , assisted by a rise in calls to local crisis centers . according to luna greenstein at the national alliance on mental illness , anthony bourdain’s suicide came only two days after the media irresponsibly reported on kate spade’s suicide . takeaways to talk about suicide in a way that encourages people to get help and look for help , greenstein recommends including local and national hotline numbers , as well as other crisis resources . other recommendations include informing , not sensationalizing . any headline of a celebrity’s death should not include suicide in the headline , and images of the method or location of death should be avoided . instead , photos of school , work , or family can be used instead . greenstein also recommends choosing words carefully , using words like “increase” and “rise” rather than more sensational words like “epidemic” or “skyrocketing . ” and terminology around suicide is important as well — the field is moving away from “committed suicide” and moving more around terms that do not stigmatize suicide as a crime , like “died by suicide , ” “completed suicide , ” “killed him\/herself , ” and “ended his\/her life . ” lastly , greenstein recommends reporting on suicide as a public health issue . suicide shouldn’t be reported the same way a crime is reported , and seeking advice from suicide prevention experts is more important than quoting police and first responders . including the warning signs of suicide as well as a “what to do” sidebar . “this is not a

obituaries talk mostly about how someone lived rather than how someone died , and although talking about suicide is difficult and often uncomfortable , suicide is the second leading cause of death for people aged 10 to 34 in the united states . responsible reporting and conversation on suicide are essential .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How Media Can Prevent Copycat Suicides: Responsible Reporting Around Celebrity Suicide \n\nResponsible reporting surrounding celebrity suicides plays a crucial role in preventing copycat suicides. The impact of media coverage on vulnerable individuals cannot be understated, making it essential for the media to exercise caution and adopt a professional approach when reporting on such sensitive matters. \n\nOne notable case that highlights the potential contagion effect is the death of Chester Bennington, lead singer of Linkin Park, whose suicide deeply affected many of his fans. Studies, such as the one conducted by Gunn et al. in the Archives of Suicide Research, have shown that widely publicized suicides can lead to an increase in searches for suicide methods or suicide prevention resources. This phenomenon, known as the Werther effect, refers to the spike in emulation or copycat suicides following a highly publicized suicide. Conversely, the Papageno effect, named after a character in Mozart's \"The Magic Flute,\" represents the positive impact media can have in raising awareness and support for suicide prevention. \n\nIt is crucial for the media to be aware of the potential contagion effect when reporting on celebrity suicides. The media should avoid glamorizing or sensationalizing suicide, as well as refrain from fixating on graphic details. In the case of Chester Bennington, highlighting the method of suicide by a prominent media source was particularly irresponsible. Such reporting can harm vulnerable individuals and perpetuate the belief that suicide is an inevitable solution.\n\nFortunately, the media has made strides in responsible reporting over the years. An example of this progress can be seen in the coverage of Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994. Media outlets at that time reported warning signs and provided hotline numbers, resulting in a decrease in suicides in the Seattle region. This highlights the importance of including crisis resources and informing the public without sensationalizing the issue.\n\nTo effectively report on suicide in a way that encourages individuals to seek help, it is recommended to include local and national hotline numbers and crisis resources in the coverage. Sensationalizing headlines that include suicide should be avoided, and instead, focus should be on images that depict the person's life, such as photos of their accomplishments, work, or family. The terminology used when discussing suicide is also vital, moving away from stigmatizing language such as \"committed suicide\" and using more neutral terms like \"died by suicide,\" \"completed suicide,\" or \"ended their life.\"\n\nFurthermore, reporting on suicide should be approached as a public health issue, seeking advice from suicide prevention experts rather than relying solely on law enforcement sources. Including warning signs of suicide and providing guidance on what to do can also be beneficial. It is essential to remember that responsible reporting on suicide is not a matter of political correctness – it is a matter of saving lives.\n\nThese guidelines for responsible reporting should not only be followed by the media but also by individuals in personal conversations. Just as obituaries focus more on celebrating a person's life rather than their cause of death, open and informed discussions about suicide can help reduce stigma and raise awareness. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people aged 10 to 34 in the United States, emphasizing the urgency and importance of responsible reporting and conversation around this critical issue.

makeup . though they’d never found a drug that could control her seizures , she’d seemed otherwise healthy and normal , and her death had come as a total surprise . this was my first brush with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( sudep ) . sudep is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures , and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy . there are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for sudep — hence the sudden , hence the unexpected . having come to neuroscience by way of physics , i confess i often forget a crucial point neurons are cells , not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns . not only is the circuit board layout shifting , always rewiring itself in learning , but activity sets off internal programs within cells , making them more or less active , or plastic , tuning their metabolism and protein production . furthermore , at the gross level , the brain isn’t a black box sealed in the skull , but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process . neurological disorders are rarely , if ever , confined to the brain . this may seem obvious , but it bears consideration . when brain areas are over or under-active , this can reverberate through other somatic systems , causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts neurons love to learn . in fact , non-neuronal cells learn too signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell’s transcriptional landscape , resulting in tissue remodelling , for example . epilepsy is particularly interesting , as it’s a prime example of a learned disease . “kindling” is a common idea in the literature once someone has had one or more seizures , they’re much more likely to become epileptic , as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern . some epileptic patients report that they’ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure ( these patients feel a pre-ictal ‘aura’ that clues them in ) , so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease . but i’d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other , less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity—in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy , through depriving the brain of oxygen , thereby quenching activity . i posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies ‘learning’ their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders . sudep is a big clue in this . it’s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of sudep cases . while most sudep events go unwitnessed , in a retrospective study of observed sudep cases caught while patients were in the hospital , researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events ( rivlin et al . , 2013 ) . there is no doubt that sudep involves a complex network of effects , but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels ( chronic intermittent hypoxia ) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of sudep patients ( giaccia , simon , & johnson , 2004 ) . hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues , from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling ( kemp & peers , 2007 ling et al . , 2001 nei , 2009 richerson , 2010 ) . up to 40% of sudep cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy , which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia ( ling et al . , 2001 p-codrea , et al . , 2005 ) , and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage ( the subendocardial myocardium , for the keen ) . sudep patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression , which is also strongly linked with hypoxia ( takano et al . , 2007 ) . all of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death . the link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented , but not well understood . in some patients , epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing . every patient has a different locus of seizure activity — the part of the brain a seizure plays out on . but sudep doesn’t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing . there may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing blood acidification , as happens in hypoxic conditions , is anti-convulsive . thus , the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem , but an evolved mechanism , or one learned by neural circuits , to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1] . this then leads to a vicious cycle breathing circuits are plastic throughout life , and strongly shaped by hypoxia ( so , 2008 ) , so even if a patient’s seizures never directly reach the brain stem , their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2] . the brain , then , might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state , which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy . the brain is sometimes too good at doing its job . many neurological diseases involve some component of being ‘learned’ by neural circuits chronic pain , neuropathy\/neuralgia , and migraine all come to mind . when considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions , or how to address their symptoms , it’s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don’t live in the brain alone . they can affect all body systems , and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to ‘medicate’ itself with whatever other systems it has control over . studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions , and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as sudep [3] . notes\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Medical Mystery: How Brains Learn Diseases and Their Cures\n\nWithin the medical field, the enigmatic phenomenon of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the study of epilepsy. Currently, there are no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP, hence its sudden and unexpected nature. To fully comprehend this mystery, it is imperative to remember that neurons are not just static contact points on a circuit board but rather living cells capable of plasticity and adaptation. Moreover, the brain's influence extends beyond its confines, affecting various bodily processes. Therefore, neurological disorders are rarely confined to the brain alone.\n\nWhen certain brain areas become over- or underactive, their effects can reverberate throughout the body, causing plastic changes in different body parts. Neurons have a capacity to learn, and this also applies to non-neuronal cells. External signals such as oxygen or nutrition levels can alter the transcriptional landscape of cells, resulting in tissue remodeling. Epilepsy serves as a captivating example of a learned disease, where repeated seizures can lead to the brain adopting problematic activity patterns.\n\nInterestingly, some epileptic patients report discovering certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize the onset of seizures. This suggests conscious strategies that patients can employ to volitionally manage their epilepsy. However, neural circuits may have evolved or learned alternative, less helpful methods of suppressing disease-related activity. In the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, the brain may deprive itself of oxygen, thus quenching activity, as a mechanism to mitigate seizure activity.\n\nUnderstanding neurological disorders through the lens of brains and bodies \"learning\" their own cures may shed light on common comorbidities seen in these disorders. SUDEP, in particular, appears to involve underlying cardio-pulmonary issues. Studies have shown that patient breathing ceases before heart failure in observed SUDEP cases. Chronic intermittent hypoxia, resulting from repeated exposure to low oxygen levels, aligns with the known abnormalities found in SUDEP patients. Hypoxia can have profound effects on various tissues, altering ion channels, gene transcription, and vascular remodeling.\n\nIn autopsies, up to 40% of SUDEP cases exhibit cardiac fibrosis, which may result from chronic intermittent hypoxia. Furthermore, damage primarily occurs in the subendocardial myocardium, the region most vulnerable to ischemic damage. Additionally, SUDEP patients often experience post-seizure cerebral depression, strongly linked to hypoxia. Collectively, these findings suggest that recurring low oxygen levels contribute to the tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately lead to patient death.\n\nWhile the connection between epilepsy and breathing problems is documented, it is not yet fully understood. Some patients may experience seizure activity directly affecting the brain stem circuits responsible for breathing. However, SUDEP can occur even in patients whose seizures do not originate in that specific brain region. A more fundamental physiological link between seizures and breathing, such as blood acidification in hypoxic conditions, may exist. The hypoxic response could serve as an evolved or learned mechanism to suppress epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures.\n\nThis leads to a vicious cycle where breathing circuits, plastic throughout life, are shaped by hypoxia. Thus, even if a patient's seizures never directly reach the brain stem, chronic seizures could result in a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia. The brain may be learning activity patterns that help control a disease state in the short term but ultimately prove deleterious. This drastic stop-gap measure manages otherwise intractable epilepsy but comes at a cost.\n\nNeurological diseases often involve neural circuits \"learning\" them, causing chronic pain, neuropathy, neuralgia, or migraines, among others. When seeking predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions or developing interventions to address their symptoms, it is crucial to remember that these diseases affect multiple body systems. Some of the most detrimental symptoms might be a result of the brain attempting to self-medicate using various systems it has control over. Framing studies with this holistic perspective can help unveil simple interventions and further refine our understanding of functional and molecular biomarkers for medical mysteries like SUDEP. END"}

Yet, these moments are not mere figments of imagination; they are real, and they continue to transpire. Life suddenly becomes poetry, and joy becomes a gateway to unexplored universes, rendering us speechless. It is only through surrender that we can truly experience awe, for this surrender surpasses verbal articulation.\n\nTranscribing these experiences, as a chronic depressive freelancer on the precipice of financial ruin, may seem peculiar.

It is not uncommon to feel a certain level of nervousness before clicking the publish button or submitting our work for consideration. This fear often stems from the uncertainty surrounding our own talents and the judgment we anticipate from others. However, it is crucial to question the validity of these concerns and explore why we allow insecurity to hinder our creative potential.\n\nEthan Hawke, in his thought-provoking TED Talk on creativity, points out the universal hesitation associated with being creative. We are undoubtedly skeptical of our own abilities, doubting how we will be evaluated based on these uncertain talents. But should we allow this fear and self-doubt to hold us back? What is it that we are so afraid of? It is essential to remind ourselves that throughout history, the world has proven to be an unreliable critic. The concept of what is deemed \"popular,\" \"valuable,\" or \"good\" is subjective and ever-changing. As creators, we must recognize that we have no control over these external judgments.\n\nWhile it is true that there are countless resources offering \"recipes for success\" in the realm of creativity, we must ask ourselves: Do we desire a formula for someone else's achievements, or do we aspire to forge our own path? The choice ultimately lies in whether we want to conform to predefined notions of success or carve out our unique creative journey.\n\nSo, instead of succumbing to the fear of judgment and second-guessing our creative abilities, let us embrace our originality. Let us remember that creativity knows no boundaries and that true innovation often stems from taking risks and thinking outside the box. Rather than seeking validation from an unpredictable external world, we should find solace in the fact that the most impactful creations challenge conventional norms.\n\nAs we navigate the realm of creativity, it is essential to detach ourselves from the fear of judgment. Trust in your creative process, embrace your unique perspective, and allow your work to speak for itself. By embracing this mindset, we can overcome the hurdle of uncertainty and unlock our true creative potential. Remember, there is no defined path until you walk it, and in embracing your authenticity, you may just pave the way for others to follow. END"}

.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When an initial thought arises, it often goes unnoticed and doesn't have a significant impact. However, as that thought repeats itself, our subconscious begins to treat it as a crucial piece of information that should shape our everyday life. Unfortunately, many of these recurring thoughts are centered around worst-case scenarios, deep fears, and paralyzing insecurities - things we perceive as potential threats. What's concerning is that a large portion of our daily actions, decisions, and outcomes stem from these automated thought patterns that reside deep within our subconscious.\n\nDr. Irvine, an expert in coaching high-achieving entrepreneurs who earn seven or eight figures, has developed a process to help them not only achieve greater levels of career success but also find fulfillment, mend relationships, and liberate themselves from the burdens of \"stressed success\" - where they appear accomplished on the surface but are unhappy underneath. To embark on this journey, Dr. Irvine advises us to engage in some serious inner work.\n\nDr. Irvine points out that it is during moments of tension, resistance, or cognitive dissonance that we have the greatest opportunity for personal transformation. In these moments, we become aware of the thoughts we consistently tell ourselves. Most high performers silently question their capabilities, experiencing imposter syndrome. They attempt to overcome, disprove, or avoid these thoughts. However, these tactics are ineffective because repression only solidifies their hold on us. The first step towards change is to gain clarity regarding our thoughts and ultimately uncover what we genuinely believe about ourselves.\n\nThe second step involves recording these thoughts. By writing them down, we externalize them from our subconscious. Some individuals resist this step, fearing that focusing on these thoughts will only amplify them. However, Dr. Irvine assures us that these thoughts already occupy the majority of our day, accounting for 80 to 90 percent of our mental processes. Therefore, it is vital to bring them into consciousness and acknowledge their existence.\n\nOnce we have recognized and recorded the limiting thoughts, the next step is to refute them. Dr. Irvine highlights the power of our brains, explaining that the mere act of becoming aware of our thoughts naturally prompts us to challenge them. By vocalizing the thought, we expose it for the falsehood it is. Alternatively, we can imagine saying the thought to someone we deeply care for - someone for whom we would go to great lengths. This exercise assists in breaking our negativity bias, which causes us to believe nine times more negative thoughts about ourselves than others. It reveals the limiting and destructive nature of these thoughts.\n\nFinally, the most potent step involves reprogramming our thinking patterns. Dr. Irvine suggests recording ourselves speaking new thoughts in the present tense, using devices like smartphones. Listening to these recordings in the morning and before bed helps establish new neural pathways in our brains - ones that align with the truth and contradict our old beliefs. Through this process, we demonstrate to our subconscious that we no longer align with those limiting thoughts.\n\nIn times of uncertainty, such as the current global situation, this process becomes increasingly vital. Our brains naturally seek familiarity and activate the fight or flight response when faced with uncertainty. Dr. Irvine recommends limiting media intake, choosing one reliable source and checking it once a day. While staying informed is crucial, being constantly inundated with information can impair our ability to focus and create. Disconnecting from this flood of neurochemicals allows us to reprogram our brains for success amidst uncertainty.\n\nDr. Irvine also encourages us to make bold moves during uncertain times. Now is the moment to develop the most compelling vision we've ever had. While we may not have control over external circumstances, we can take charge of our own vision, ensuring it is vibrant and multi-dimensional. Dr. Irvine inspires her clients, students, and community to rise up and lead during these challenging times. She advises taking action, such as going live on social media platforms, updating pages, or sending emails. By doing so, we demonstrate mindful leadership that considers the realities of the current predicament while still providing value and service to others.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the fear that leading during these times may appear insensitive. However, Dr. Irvine reminds us that withholding our gifts and the potential to change someone's life would be a disservice. Leading with generosity and service allows us to be a beacon of support, particularly during times of uncertainty. Challenges enable us to differentiate between those who solve problems and those who exacerbate them. If we find ourselves on the wrong side, now is the perfect opportunity to recalibrate our thinking and shift towards problem-solving. END"}

Renowned physician Hippocrates once stated, \"Walking is man's best medicine!\" This simple act, although seemingly effortless, necessitates a significant amount of cerebral activity. In the enlightening book \"In Praise of Walking\" by Shane O'Mara [1], the author commences by illuminating the existence of a sea squirt. During its initial developmental stages, this organism actively traverses rock pools in search of sustenance. To facilitate such movement, the young sea squirt evolves with an eye, a brain, and a spinal cord. However, as the sea squirt matures, a pivotal transformation occurs. It attaches itself to a stationary rock, forsaking any further locomotion. It proceeds to consume its superfluous brain, eye, and spinal cord, rendering them unnecessary. While humans may appear dissimilar to sea squirts, the parallels between the two species are remarkably closer than anticipated. Developmental biologists conducted a comparative study of the genetic makeup of two seemingly distinct creatures, namely the skate (a type of fish) and the mouse. Their investigation entailed examining shared genes that govern crucial aspects of movement, such as spinal cord development, limb or fin placement, and the coordination of adjacent muscles and nerves [3].

In this regard, a simple and cost-effective technique has emerged as a promising solution. The accompanying image is sourced from the author's personal collection.\n\nAlthough carbon constitutes a mere 0.025 percent of the Earth's crust by mass, its unique valency number of 4 allows it to react with various other elements. A carbon atom readily shares four electrons to achieve stability. Furthermore, carbon possesses the ability to exist in three oxidation states, namely +2, +3, and +4. Consequently, it becomes an adaptable partner for other elements, leading to the formation of compounds. This exceptional characteristic of carbon has fostered a strong and enduring partnership with hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon.\n\nInspired by the versatility of carbon, scientists have established a distinct field of study known as organic chemistry. Organic compounds, which contain carbon, constitute an indispensable component of the living world as they serve as the structural foundation for numerous compounds. They form the backbone of essential biological entities such as carbohydrates, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acids.\n\nAs technology advanced, organic compounds found new applications. Derivatives of organic compounds, commonly known as fossil fuels, are extensively utilized worldwide for energy production. Additionally, organic compounds contribute to the creation of various human commodities, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, and plastics. However, their widespread presence in these products has led to the contamination of water sources. While some organic compounds are harmless and degrade easily, others have significant detrimental effects on the environment and human health.\n\nOver time, scientists developed ion-exchange membranes to purify water. Nonetheless, the removal of neutral species from water remained a challenge. Many organic compounds are neutral in nature, complicating the purification process. Reverse osmosis (RO) technology emerged as the most advanced method utilizing ion-exchange principles today. RO can purify even highly concentrated water sources such as seawater. However, the increasing presence of organic contaminants has posed complications. The high cost of RO implementation and the hazardous impact of organic compounds on RO membranes have reduced their lifespan. Organochlorines, for instance, have proven to be particularly destructive to RO membranes.\n\nConsequently, the need to remove organic compounds before subjecting water to the RO process has become essential. Moreover, the substantial amount of wastewater generated as a result of the RO process, known as RO concentrate, can be recycled for various domestic and industrial applications after suitable treatment. It is crucial, however, to employ cost-effective treatment technologies to ensure the sustainability and affordability of such ventures. END"}

( porges , s . 2011 ) it’s why a monotoned voice puts us to sleep and our ability to absorb , and perhaps retain , that information is comprised due to the shallow fundamental frequencies underlying a dull quality of voice . as children , we can cry and speak infinitely , with nigh a break or touch of fatigue . we explore all manners of sounds , find delight in their whimsical impermanence , and wail on sirens that take our voice to the bottom of its range and swing it to its highest peaks . the colour , or prosody , of a child’s voice , is a remarkable symphony . along the line , the range of the voice gets narrower . an exciting speaker that innervates the inner ear muscles of the audience swoops and swirls his voice through the frequencies available to him , like a painting dancing with colour . so what restricts the colour of our voice ? firstly , in order to create prosody in the voice , your voice requires great finesse in the muscles controlling the vocal tract . many of these vocal muscles required for prosody are innervated by the myelinated vagus nerve , and this nerve only fires efficiently when you are in a relaxed state . the reason behind this is that this nerve is governed under one of the autonomic nervous systems , the parasympathetic nervous system the system responsible for regeneration and lowering the heart rate . when you are stressed , the sympathetic nervous system is dominant , and nerve efferents like the myelinated vagus nerve become less prominent and must battle to exert its influence over these vocal muscles . its why , when nervous , we find it difficult to speak , or even to speak at all ! if a person finds themselves in a constant state of stress or tension like anxiety , your body begins to learn to use your voice in a different way through repetition . bodily and neural resources are no longer required for empathetic human speech but rather the priming of muscles for movement or , its nemesis , freezing . speech is stripped to its bare minimum , and prosody , an element required for social cohesion , is effectively switched off . the body does the opposite required for cohesion it either wants to fight , freeze or run away , so newer neocortex activities like speaking with prosody , or active listening by triggering the tightening of the middle ear bones , are not required . if the anxiety persists , and the vocal folds remain unstretched , the mind-body learns to acquire this new muscle memory , and the range of the voice in normal conversation can remain lacking . because the voice is key to expressing emotions we veer into the field of psychoneuroimmunology . psychoneuroimmunology can be defined as the study of interactions between behavior , neural and endocrine function , and immune processes ( ader et al , 1995 ) this is why understanding your emotional life is imperative to improving your voice . if you don’t get aware of your shit it may prove difficult to become aware of how your voice changes and adapts to situations you may find yourself in , especially stressful ones , if you don’t know what is triggering you to find it stressful in the first place . get aware of your shit . voice work is not easy , there is no quick fix , and you will have to develop a strong discipline to post-pone gratification but like anything in life , anything worth doing is difficult . so , a monotoned voice can have its root in your emotional life but it may also be maintained by poor breathing or posture . if you underpower your voice , the vocal folds have to maintain a thickness that limits the range of your frequencies at your disposal . it’s why a monotoned voice is typically quite deep . an underpowered voice means there is a lack of breath to support the voice , you may get the words out phonetically , but the ideas and emotional life of what you are saying , which live in the variances of the range of the voice , are non-existent . firstly , to reintroduce the potential for dynamic range in your voice focus your attention on the vowels in the word . each vowel is a formant with a different set of frequencies in the voice this means there is naturally occurring modulation in the vowels you speak . over enunciating the vowels as a practice in your free time , such as reading from a book out loud , can help you get a sense of their potential in your common tongue . you’ll find that the sensation lingers having completed the exercise . secondly , singing is a must if your voice lacks dynamism . there is a colossal amount of research on the benefits of singing on your physical health , such as governing the release of a newly discovered chemical called endocannabinoids , which does exactly what you think it does , but it also helps stretch your vocal folds and activate articulators that may have become dormant . it forces you to kickstart your respiratory muscles to function cohesively with voicing , meaning , you learn how to give enough air to your voice so the tone and quality are not underpowered . but it needs to be practiced so might i suggest the shower ! this leads us to our next rule . vocal habit 2 underpowering this is exactly how it sounds a self-defeating habit that really sucks as it pulls your legs out from under you ! this commonly occurs when you have something important to say , and that’s the crux because it’s important , it carries more weight , and if you don’t step up to bear it upon your shoulders , the words can implode before the idea has even left your mouth . it takes courage to speak your worth because once it ' s passed your lips , you cannot take it back however , underpowering tries to do just that , “one foot out of the door and one foot in” . you have to commit whole heartedly . there’s no sitting on the fence when you are required to speak on matters that are important to you ! underpowering means that not enough breath is being capitalised to give enough tone , amplitude , and resonant quality to the voice so that it can either sound muffled , monotone , non-audible , or thin ( lacking in harmonics that capture the inner-ear to regulate neural functions that engage social cohesion ) . here are two ways it can happen the first is that the tongue slightly stiffens up and retracts back into the throat , physically stemming the tide of sound from escaping , or “swallowing your words” as it is known . it may sound like lunacy that you’re trying to do one thing but your body is doing another but this is the role , or a specimen , of cognitive dissonance . another key example of underpowering is when your voice fails to make it to the end of your sentence . if you consistently fall off the end of your sentence , where coincidentally the crux of the idea lives , this should concern you as it detracts from the power of your idea . the second is a locking of the respiratory muscles . we do this when anxious to protect the body . without going into the phylogenetic heritage of our nervous system , which you can do here , our response to stress developed to protect us from predators , so the tensing or priming of muscles was key to our survival . the most common is the constricting of the core muscles ( rectus abdominis , transversus abominis , etc ) . a locked belly , however , does not allow for thoracic capacity to increase to efficiently intake enough air for what you may want to say , due to your core muscles being an integral part of sustaining phonation . energy , that should be directed to controlling airflow , is instead directed to protecting the body from an ancient enemy . understanding how your body reacts to stress is integral to transforming the ancient neural vestiges we maintain , such as the fight-flight response to stress , into something that you can use to your adavantage . the key is in the concept of “no effort” . restricting primary muscles , especially those used for respiration , has an enormous impact on the use of your voice because you tend to recruit secondary respiratory muscles to pick up the slack . these muscles , such as the sternocleidomastoid , are not meant for the fine control of vocalisation and can introduce tension within the vocal tract due to their proximity . to read more about the effects of breathing on the voice may i suggest you begin with , what crocodiles and humans have in common . if you tend to find that a locked belly is common for you , you may have to begin a process of exercises that enhance your proprioception , so that you can begin to let go of excessive , and unnecessary tension , in response to stress . relaxing and releasing specific muscles can teach you the essence of “no effort” because it teaches you to understand , via proprioception , what muscles are required , and muscles that aren’t . like learning the guitar , where every muscle is involved , you have to learn to use only what is necessary and if it means learning how to breathe effectively again , like an infant , then so be it , there is no shame in learning . your body is trying to protect you from the tiger lurking behind the reeds , be patient . what happens now practice . record yourself and listen to yourself free of negative judgment but with honest critique and appraisal . if you find your voice lacks pitch and resonating variance , trying incorporating your body into the language . jumping up or down , sitting and standing up , or running on the spot , will help to ignite , or rather , give you the gift of realizing your potential for colour within your voice . become aware of the vowels within your speech , and try singing you’ve nothing to lose and everything to gain . get aware of your shit . you must take responsibility for how your body deals with stress , not just for the sake of your voice but for your own self-understanding . because it is such a primal and visceral biological function it is paramount to understand what patterns you’ve developed to cope with it and with that knowledge you may begin to unpack the myriad of ways that it affects your voice . how stress affects your voice , is another good starting point for those seeking more information . if you have any questions please feel free to respond below .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Vocal Habit 1: Modulating the Acoustic Energy in the Human Voice\n\nOne of the fascinating aspects of vocal prosody is the modulation of acoustic energy within the frequencies of the human voice, similar to that found in music. This modulation not only characterizes the melody of our voice but also has significant effects on our neural regulation, particularly on the middle ear muscles (auditory ossicles). By modulating these muscles, vocal prosody has the ability to induce a calm behavioral and physiological state by increasing vagal regulation of the heart, ultimately promoting more spontaneous social engagement behaviors.\n\nResearch conducted by Porges (2011) highlights the positive impact of listening to melodies on our overall well-being. Conversely, a monotone voice tends to have a soporific effect, putting listeners to sleep. Additionally, our ability to absorb and retain information can be compromised when exposed to a dull quality of voice characterized by shallow fundamental frequencies. It is worth noting that as children, we possess a remarkable symphony of sounds in our voice, effortlessly exploring the entire range of frequencies. Unfortunately, as we grow older, the range of our voice progressively narrows.\n\nSo, what restricts the color and dynamism of our voice? Primarily, the creation of prosody in our voice relies on the fine control of vocal tract muscles. Many of these vocal muscles involved in producing prosody receive neural connections from the myelinated vagus nerve. However, the myelinated vagus nerve only fires efficiently when we are in a relaxed state. This is due to its regulation by the parasympathetic nervous system, which governs regeneration and low heart rate. In contrast, when we experience stress, the sympathetic nervous system becomes dominant, suppressing the influence of the myelinated vagus nerve on these vocal muscles. Consequently, speaking becomes difficult or even impossible under stressful conditions.\n\nWhen individuals find themselves in a constant state of stress, such as those with anxiety, the body adapts and learns to use the voice differently through repeated experiences. Empathetic human speech is no longer the priority; instead, the body directs its resources towards priming muscles for movement or, in some cases, freezing. As a result, prosody, which is essential for social cohesion, is effectively switched off. This contradicts the body's natural inclination towards social cohesion, as it either gears up for fight or flight or withdraws from the situation. Therefore, neocortex activities such as speaking with prosody or actively listening by triggering the tightening of the middle ear bones become unnecessary.\n\nIf anxiety persists and the vocal folds remain unstretched, the mind-body connection learns to adopt this new muscle memory, resulting in a limited range of voice during normal conversation. The voice plays a crucial role in expressing emotions, which brings us to the field of psychoneuroimmunology. This discipline focuses on studying the interactions between behavior, neural and endocrine function, and immune processes (Ader et al., 1995). Understanding our emotional lives becomes imperative when seeking to improve our voice. It is essential to become aware of the triggers that cause stress and learn how they affect our voice, as this self-awareness is the first step towards improvement.\n\nVocal Habit 2: Underpowering\n\nUnderpowering is a self-defeating habit that can undermine the potential impact of your voice. It often occurs when we have something important to say but fail to fully commit to communicating our thoughts effectively. Underpowering results in insufficient breath support, leading to a muffled, monotone, or non-audible voice lacking in resonant quality.\n\nTwo common manifestations of underpowering are the slight stiffening and retraction of the tongue towards the throat, preventing the sound from escaping. This phenomenon is known as \"swallowing your words.\" Additionally, some individuals consistently fail to project their voice to the end of their sentences, where the core ideas reside. This inability to sustain vocalization until the completion of a thought diminishes the power and effectiveness of the message.\n\nAnother aspect of underpowering is the locking of respiratory muscles, which often occurs when we experience anxiety. This physiological response is rooted in our evolutionary heritage, as it served to protect our bodies from predators. The tensing or priming of muscles was essential for survival. It is crucial to understand how our body reacts to stress, as this knowledge can help transform ancient neural responses, such as the fight-or-flight response, into tools we can use to our advantage. Effortless control and effective use of primary respiratory muscles play a significant role in vocalization. When these muscles are restricted, secondary respiratory muscles, such as the sternocleidomastoid, are recruited, often resulting in tension within the vocal tract due to their proximity.\n\nTo reintroduce dynamic range into your voice, it is recommended to focus on the vowels in your speech. Each vowel possesses a distinct set of frequencies, creating natural modulation in the voice. Practicing over-enunciation of vowels during free time, such as reading aloud from a book, can enhance your awareness of their potential and their role in your everyday speech. This exercise can leave a lasting sensation, providing a sense of the possibilities that lie within your voice.\n\nIncorporating singing into your vocal routine is also highly recommended. Singing has been found to have numerous benefits for physical health, including the release of endocannabinoids, a newly discovered chemical that promotes relaxation. Singing helps stretch the vocal folds and activate dormant articulators, ensuring proper breath support and preventing underpowering. The utilization of respiratory muscles in harmony with voicing leads to a well-supported tone and excellent quality. Consider practicing singing in the shower as a enjoyable and effective way to kickstart your vocal development.\n\nIn conclusion, developing a strong discipline and commitment to vocal improvement is essential, as there is no quick fix. Understanding the impact of stress and emotions on your voice is of utmost importance, as it enables you to identify patterns and triggers that affect your voice negatively. By bringing awareness to your body's response to stress, you can begin to unravel the ways in which stress influences your voice. Finally, recording yourself and conducting honest self-evaluation can help you identify areas for improvement and actively work towards developing a more dynamic and expressive voice. END"}
{"prompt":"food cravings microscopic puppetmasters might be involved 5 arguments that gut microbes can manipulate food choices . image by openclipart-vectors from pixabay resisting food cravings can be a nightmare for some and a struggle for many . while the cause of food cravings itself is multifaceted — encompassing environmental , cultural , social , psychological , genetic , and behavioural ( habits ) factors — scientists have pondered on the microbial aspects as well . given that the gut-brain axis is well established in modern biology , it’s quite imaginable for gut microbes to induce cravings in the brain . as professor carlo maley , director of the arizona cancer and evolution center and the first president of the international society for evolution , ecology and cancer , wrote as a senior co-author in bioassays “gut microbes may manipulate host eating behaviour in ways that promote their fitness at the expense of host fitness . ” this idea first stems from a classic example that a microbe can directly manipulate host behaviour . the parasite toxoplasma gondii enters the rodent’s brain , making it lost its sense of fear for cat’s urine . instead , infected rodents became attracted to cat’s urine — “a propensity that promotes the transmission of t . gondii at the expense of the fitness of the rat , ” they said . the same may apply to food cravings — that those gut microbes somehow convince the host at the subconscious level to prefer foods that contain specific nutrients that favour their growth . gut microbes that love chocolates or sweets , for example , might motivate the host to eat them more often . “like microscopic puppetmasters , microbes may control the eating behavior of hosts… , ” they reckoned . to support their scientific viewpoint , professor maley and colleagues articulated 5 compelling evidence . 1 . taste receptors germ-free mice are bred in a sterile environment and , hence , they lack proper gut microbiota . germ-free mice are one of the best research tools to understand the impact of gut microbiota on the host physiology . studies have shown that germ-mice have an increased preference for fatty and sugary foods than normal mice with gut microbiota . and the germ-free mice have higher expression of receptors for fat and sugar in their mouth and intestines . this suggests that low gut microbial diversity , as reflected in germ-free mice , encourages food preferences for fats and sugars . 2 . the vagal tone in 2008 , researchers at mayo clinic , minnesota have successfully applied vagal blockage ( vbloc ) therapy to treat obesity . participants consumed 30% fewer calories as a result of quicker satiation and reduced hunger . the similar weight loss outcomes were replicated in 2016 and in 2017 , with the latter study concluding that “vbloc therapy continues to result in medically meaningful weight loss with a favourable safety profile through 2 years . ”the food and drug administration ( fda ) has , in fact , already approved vbloc therapy for treating obesity in 2015 . the vagus nerve is the main driver of the body’s rest-and-digest activities . it makes sense that an overactive vagus nerve would lead to excessive digestive activities and resulting hunger . stimulating the vagus nerve with noradrenaline in mice made them desire more food despite already eating beyond the point of satiation this did not occur if the vagus nerve was cut . some gut microbes such as bacillus and escherichia species secrete noradrenaline . “gut microbes that produce adrenergic neurochemicals may [therefore] contribute to overeating via mechanisms involving vagal nerve activity , ” professor maley and his team wrote . 3 . appetite-regulating hormones lower levels of satiety hormones ( e . g . , leptin and cholecystokinin ) have been found in germ-free mice . feeding mice with lactobacillus probiotics , in turn , inhibited the release of hunger hormones ( e . g . , agouti-related protein and neuropeptide y ) in the brain . certain gut bacteria can synthesize peptides that bear structural similarities to human appetite-regulating peptide hormones such as ghrelin and leptin . the structure of a protein is the chief determinant of which receptor ( s ) it binds to and consequently what effect ( s ) it exerts . thus , these microbial peptides are ‘mimics’ to host’s appetite-regulating peptide hormones , in terms of structure and function . these microbial peptide mimics , however , are usually silenced by host enzymes — “a phenomenon that could have evolved as a mammalian counter-adaptation to microbial manipulation , ” professor maley et al . said in a statement . but in case they were not silenced completely , “microbial manipulation” may be in effect . 4 . toxins under conditions of nutrients imbalances , microbial communities normally at low levels might bloom . excessive iron bioavailability in the gut , for instance , increases the populations of pathogenic salmonella and candida species that can release toxins and injure the gut . the resulting gut inflammation could induce a negative mood , leading to emotional eating , the researchers hypothesize . otherwise , the gut bacterial toxins might also trigger the avoidance of specific foods via the activation of pain receptors present in the gut . 5 . dietary preferences “prevotella grows best on carbohydrates dietary fibre provides a competitive advantage to bifidobacteria , and bacteroidetes has a substrate preference for certain fats , ” professor maley et al . explained . whereas roseburia species thrive with polysaccharides or complex carbohydrates . japanese natives have evolved a gut bacterium called bacteroides plebeius that digests seaweed . these show that gut microbes have food preferences too . it won’t be a surprise if they have evolved mechanisms to improve their fitness ( i . e . , growth ) by influencing the host dietary choices , for example . “modern biology suggests that our bodies are composed of a diversity of organisms competing for nutritional resources , ” the researchers wrote . evolutionary competition between the host vs . gut microbes fitness may lead to “cognitive conflict” in food choices — i . e . , food cravings . “exerting self-control over eating choices may be partly a matter of suppressing microbial signals that originate in the gut , ” professor maley and colleagues conclude . “acquired tastes may [therefore] be due to the acquisition of microbes that benefit from those foods . ”\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Food cravings: The Influence of Gut Microbes on Food Choices\n\nResisting food cravings can be a significant challenge for many individuals. While the causes of food cravings are multifaceted, scientists have begun to explore the microbial aspects as a contributing factor. The gut-brain axis, a well-established concept in modern biology, offers insight into the potential influence of gut microbes on inducing food cravings.\n\nProfessor Carlo Maley, director of the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center and the first president of the International Society for Evolution, Ecology, and Cancer, highlights the possibility that gut microbes manipulate host eating behavior to promote their own fitness at the expense of the host. This idea draws from the example of a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, which can manipulate a rodent's behavior and make it attracted to the urine of its predator, the cat. Similarly, gut microbes might influence food cravings, persuading the host to prefer foods that contain specific nutrients favoring microbial growth. In a sense, microbes act as microscopic puppetmasters, controlling the eating behavior of hosts.\n\nTo support this scientific viewpoint, Professor Maley and colleagues present five compelling pieces of evidence. Firstly, studies conducted on germ-free mice, which lack proper gut microbiota, reveal that they have an increased preference for fatty and sugary foods compared to normal mice with gut microbiota. Furthermore, germ-free mice demonstrate higher expression of receptors for fat and sugar in their mouth and intestines. This suggests that low gut microbial diversity, as reflected in germ-free mice, encourages food preferences for fats and sugars.\n\nAnother piece of evidence comes from the exploration of the vagal tone, the main driver of the body's rest-and-digest activities.

Although these microbial peptides are generally silenced by host enzymes, the scenario changes if they are not completely silenced, potentially leading to microbial manipulation of appetite-regulating hormones.\n\nToxins produced by gut bacterial communities under nutrient imbalances might also influence food choices. Excessive iron bioavailability, for example, can result in the release of toxins from pathogenic salmonella and candida species, leading to gut inflammation and a negative mood that could trigger emotional eating. Additionally, gut bacterial toxins might activate pain receptors in the gut, causing the avoidance of specific foods.\n\nLastly, dietary preferences of certain gut microbial species provide evidence of how gut microbes have their own food preferences. Some bacteria thrive with carbohydrates, while others prefer certain fats or complex carbohydrates. For instance, Japanese natives have evolved a gut bacterium called Bacteroides plebeius that can digest seaweed. These findings suggest that gut microbes may have mechanisms to improve their own growth by influencing host dietary choices.\n\nIn light of these findings, it becomes apparent that our bodies are composed of a diversity of organisms competing for nutritional resources. The evolutionary competition between host and gut microbes in terms of fitness can lead to cognitive conflict in food choices, also known as food cravings. Overcoming these cravings may involve suppressing microbial signals originating in the gut, suggesting that acquired tastes may be due to the acquisition of microbes that benefit from particular foods.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential influence of gut microbes on food cravings is an intriguing area of study. While the causes of food cravings are multifaceted, considering the microbial aspects is essential in comprehending the complexity of this phenomenon. Further research is needed to deepen our understanding of how gut microbes manipulate food choices, potentially opening doors to new strategies for managing cravings and improving overall health.

for respiratory diseases. In the United States, it is estimated that one-fifth of children's medical visits involve the prescription of antibiotics, with 50% being broad-spectrum antibiotics like macrolides, and over 70% being prescribed for respiratory diseases. However, it is important to note that antibiotics only kill bacteria and not viruses, although both can cause respiratory illnesses. As a result, around 29% of the antibiotics prescribed for respiratory diseases in children are unnecessary, accounting for over 10 million visits per year in the US.\n\nA national study conducted in 2011 in the US found that the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics in pediatric outpatient settings is alarmingly common and often inappropriate. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that one in three antibiotics were prescribed needlessly. This unnecessary use of antibiotics not only contributes to the problem of antibiotic resistance but also poses health risks, especially in children.\n\nDuring infancy and childhood, the gut microbiota undergoes rapid changes. The use of antibiotics, particularly broad-spectrum ones, can disrupt the beneficial gut microbes. Additionally, during these stages, children's brains and bodies are experiencing sensitive growth phases.\n\nStudies have shown a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and weight gain in children. In a study conducted in 2019, it was found that children who had taken antibiotics within their first year of life had an increased risk of excess weight and future obesity. This dose-dependent increase in weight remained significant even after adjusting for various factors such as maternal age, BMI, race, marital status, income, education, smoking, diabetes, and breastfeeding.\n\nThe impact on weight gain is more pronounced with broad-spectrum antibiotics like cephalosporins and macrolides. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, on the other hand, had little to no impact on weight gain unless they were taken for 5-7 courses. Similar findings have been observed in other large-scale studies, further establishing the dose-response effect of antibiotics on weight gain. Boys appear to be more susceptible to weight gain from antibiotic use compared to girls.\n\nApart from weight gain, early life antibiotic exposure has also been linked to neurodevelopmental consequences. A study conducted in New Zealand in 2017 followed 871 children from birth and found that those who had been exposed to antibiotics within their first year of life had an elevated risk of behavioral issues, symptoms of depression, and ADHD at 3.5 and 11 years of age. Similar results were replicated in a 2019 study conducted by the same research team, which examined a different cohort of 473 children. The earlier the antibiotics were taken, the worse the neurodevelopmental outcomes were observed.\n\nThere is also evidence to suggest that disturbances in the infant gut microbiota may underlie the detrimental effects of antibiotics on neurodevelopment. Although the aforementioned studies did not directly analyze the gut microbiota, it is speculated that disruptions in infant gut microbiota may contribute to the negative effects observed. Animal experiments have shown that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiota and memory in mice, followed by abnormalities in brain biochemistry related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and socioemotional neuropeptide systems.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that misuse and unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics pose significant risks, especially in children. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been shown to disrupt the infant gut microbiota and are associated with weight gain and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is crucial to reserve the use of antibiotics for necessary cases and to explore alternative treatment options whenever possible. A useful resource for parents in determining whether antibiotics are truly necessary is a JAMA Pediatrics article by Professor Megan Moreno, MD, titled \"When Your Child Does Not Need Antibiotics.\" END"}
{"prompt":"1 . “what’s so special about being human ? ” yes , it’s jose mourinho . if i had to explain , it wouldn’t be funny . what’s so special about the human brain ? a question broad and deep , one that has obsessed thinkers since antiquity . our once god-like status , apart and above from all animals , now steadily eroded by science , from natural selection placing us as but one species evolved from and in parallel to many others , to genetics putting the boot in by showing that we share 90 percent of our dna with cats . including my cat bob , and he constantly falls off the back of the sofa . you’d have thought neuroscience would have been all over the question of what’s special about the human brain , what with it being the study of the brain and all . but what we could do has been very limited . largely we have only been able to observe behaviour , stuff we can do that other species cannot talking endlessly in complex grammars , voting for bell-ends , that sort of thing . and supplement these observations with crude measures of the brain’s structure — how many neurons it has , which bits are thicker or larger than others , which bits are folded — compare them to other species , and going “ooo look it’s different” . but to understand why the human brain is “special” we need some kind of theory as to why any of those crude brain differences would make any contribution to that specialness . for a start , to know what’s different about the neurons themselves what’s different about the types of neurons that exist , or the signals they send , or both . which is the preserve of us “systems” neuroscientists . yet systems neuroscience hasn’t had much to say about this question , because of the deep problems of measuring neurons in humans . until , that is , this year . a . special codes in a brave paper , pryluk and colleagues attempted a direct comparison of how the code used by neurons differed between humans and monkeys . they took long recordings of single neurons from the amygdala and cingulate cortex of monkeys . and compared them to similar recordings from the same regions in humans . these human recordings are ultra-rare they came from patients with epilepsy that was both so serious and so unresponsive to drugs that they were being prepped for surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures — and to find that part , they had electrodes implanted for a week or more . and while these electrodes were in there , and while laying in their hospital bed , the patients graciously agreed to do a series of tasks for the experimenters . with these precious data to hand , pryluk and friends asked a straightforward question how much information are these neurons sending ? in practice , this was a tough question to ask , as there are all sorts of things to compensate for , like correcting for differing firing rates across neurons and between species . but if we believe their measurement of how much information a neuron sends , their end result is clear . human neurons in both the amygdala and cingulate cortex send more information — in that they are closer to the maximum possible rate of information sending — and do so more efficiently they send fewer spikes for the same amount of information . which means ? who knows . but their results point to human cortex having an increased capacity , so that much more information can be represented across a population of neurons , but at the cost of less robust coding — if fewer spikes are used , so the message being transmitted is more sensitive to failure and noise . and as know , the human brain is very sensitive to failure . b . special neurons ? while the pryluk paper hinted at something special about how the human cortex encodes information , it didn’t tell us anything about whether this is because the types of neurons are special to humans . we get much of our deep understanding of types of neurons from mice , thanks to their being the workhorse of genetics ( a good thing that the actual workhorse is not the workhorse of genetics , otherwise janelia farm would be , literally , a farm . and about 10000 square miles in size ) . hence “what’s so special about the human brain ? ” translates in genetics to how do we differ from mice ? a nature paper from the allen brain institute tackled this question head-on by directly comparing the gene expression between the cortex of the human and mouse . to do that , they first had to solve the small problem of accurately sequencing the rna-expression of single neurons in the human cortex . having cracked that , they then grouped all their neurons into types according to the similarity of their expressed genes . the result ? 69 different types of neurons in the human cortex , of which 24 are excitatory ( as in , they expressed glutamate ) and 45 are inhibitory . so which of these 69 types of neuron are unique , are responsible for endowing we humans with our special brain thinking stuff ? none . all 69 are also closely matched in the mouse cortex . the major difference is not the type of neuron , but where they are found . in mice , all 24 types of excitatory cell stick to one particular layer of the cortex . in humans , many of those same excitatory types appear in more than one layer of the cortex . and why would this make the human cortex special ? who knows . yet their results are strong confirmation of what we all know evolution is a tinkerer . we may have diverged from rodents about 90 million years ago , but in something as complex as the mammalian brain , in which genes define merely an outline of the details of the adult brain , big changes will almost always be catastrophic . so the main difference between the neurons in the mouse and human cortex is not in the proliferation of brand new types of neurons , but in the repurposing of what is already to hand . oh , and the fact that mice have about 10 millions neurons in their cortex , and we have about 17 billion . c . dendrites predict intelligence ? we like to think humans are the most intelligent species on the planet , in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary . a provocative paper at the very end of 2018 asked what it is about our neurons that makes us intelligent . and the answer is the more complex the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in our cortex , the higher our iq . wow ! well , maybe . such unusual claims deserve close scrutiny . after all , extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence . as we have no theory which predicts that more complex dendrites have anything to do with intelligence , so we need some pretty compelling evidence to believe this is not just happenstance correlation . the researchers obtained another rare sample of human cortical neurons in this case , from bits of the temporal lobe removed during brain surgery , placed on ice , then popped into the experimental set-up as soon as practically possible while the neurons still lived . they took a range of measurements from the neurons . each patient took an iq test . and the researchers correlated some of the measurements with the iq scores . why these measurements ? no reasons given — so already alarm bells are sounding about what other measurements were correlated with iq , found to be lacking , and omitted from the paper . is the evidence compelling ? no . the key evidence is the correlation between the total length of the dendrites and the iq of the patient . namely , this figure from goriounova et al ( 2018 ) . each symbol is the average over the neurons in one subject error bars are one standard deviation . the correlation ( r value ) , regression ( black line ) , and confidence interval of regression ( blue shading ) all appear to be taken from the symbols — i . e . the average scores . leaving aside the fact that this is the best correlation they have , and it is still weak ( explaining 26% of the variance ) , take a closer look . each data-point is a patient , so the value for the length of the dendrites is an average over the measured neurons in that patient . now you don’t have to be a neuroanatomy geek to know that pyramidal neurons come in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes , so averaging over them is a bit… . well , charitably we’d call it weird . more bluntly , meaningless . and i’ve just told you that human cortex contains about 24 types of excitatory neuron , and most of those are some kind of pyramidal neuron . this correlation contains just 72 pyramidal neurons in total . so it hideously undersamples the diversity of pyramidal neuron dendrites in human cortex . worse , the above figure and others in the paper are textbook examples of how not to compute a correlation . the correlations are computed using averages — without taking into account how wrong those averages might be . and they could be so wrong that the correlation disappears completely . indeed , looking at the range of data variation ( the error bars ) in the above figure , i’d wager the correlation would indeed disappear if tested properly ( more on this in the appendix below ) . finally , a simple thought experiment . these neurons happen to come from the temporal lobe of the cortex , a region plausibly involved in some kind of “thinking” that might contribute to an iq score . but that was just because these patients had epilepsy , and the temporal lobe usually contains the region that starts epileptic brain activity . but what if these samples had been from primary visual cortex ( v1 ) ? they’d find the same diversity of sizes of pyramidal neuron dendrites , because types of pyramidal neuron are largely consistent across the cortex . but if they’d reported a correlation between the size of dendrites in v1 and a person’s iq score , who would have taken them seriously ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \"What Makes the Human Brain Special?\"\n\nWhen considering what sets humans apart, one cannot help but ponder the uniqueness of the human brain. This question has long fascinated intellectuals throughout history. However, recent scientific advancements have challenged our once assumed god-like superiority and highlighted our shared genetic makeup with other animals, such as our feline companions. Although neuroscience has been the study of the brain, our understanding of what makes the human brain special has been limited. We have mainly relied on observing human behavior and comparing brain structures to those of other species. To truly comprehend the distinctiveness of the human brain, we need a theory that explains how these structural differences contribute to its special attributes.\n\nNotably, a recent study by Pryluk and colleagues shed light on this question by directly comparing how neurons transmit information in humans versus monkeys. The researchers recorded neural activity from the amygdala and cingulate cortex of both species. Interestingly, they found that human neurons in these areas sent more information more efficiently than their primate counterparts. This suggests that the human cortex has an increased capacity to represent and process information across a population of neurons. However, this heightened capacity comes at the expense of less robust coding, making the message transmitted more susceptible to failure and noise.\n\nAdditionally, another study from the Allen Brain Institute aimed to uncover whether the types of neurons in the human cortex are unique to humans compared to mice. The researchers examined gene expression patterns in the cortices of both species. Surprisingly, they discovered 69 different types of neurons in the human cortex, including excitatory and inhibitory cells. However, none of these neuron types were exclusive to humans, as similar types were found in mice. The significant disparity lies in the distribution of these types within the cortex. In mice, excitatory cells adhere to one specific layer of the cortex, while in humans, they can be found in multiple layers. Although the impact of this difference on the specialness of the human cortex remains uncertain, it emphasizes the evolutionary tinkering nature of neural development.\n\nMoreover, an intriguing study conducted at the end of 2018 delved into the relationship between the complexity of dendrites in pyramidal neurons and human intelligence. The researchers analyzed samples of human cortical neurons taken from the temporal lobe during brain surgery. They found that individuals with more complex dendrites tended to have higher IQ scores. However, it is crucial to approach these findings cautiously, as the correlation between dendrite complexity and intelligence lacks a theoretical explanation and is relatively weak. Furthermore, the study's methodology raises questions about other measurements examined and omitted from the analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the uniqueness of the human brain is a complex endeavor. Although advancements in neuroscience have provided insights into certain aspects, many questions remain unanswered. Exploring the differences in information transmission, neuron types, and dendritic complexity between humans and other species offers valuable perspectives, but further research is necessary to unravel the true nature of what makes the human brain special.

this thought process is a battle against yourself more than anything else . and the more time you spend fussing about it , the higher the likelihood you will find a reason not to publish or bail on an idea . to stop doubting the value or quality of your piece , it’s worth exploring where this feeling originates . i’ve come across a few concepts that explain the psychological process that could cause this doubt , namely the frequency illusion and collective consciousness . frequency illusion as the premise of this article suggests , this concept has already been studied at length and has been coined the frequency illusion by stanford linguistics professor arnold zwicky and is more commonly known as the baader-meinhof phenomenon . the frequency illusion is a result of two well-known psychological processes , selective attention ( noticing things that are salient to us , disregarding the rest ) and confirmation bias ( looking for things that support our hypotheses , disregarding potential counterevidence ) as i’m not too familiar with psychological processes , the quote above didn’t tell me that much . so i dug a little deeper into the components that comprise the frequency illusion . photo by ricardo gomez angel on unsplash selective attention attention refers to how we actively process information in our environment . it’s not only about applying focus on a specific task but also involves ignoring other information and stimuli . attention is a limited resource therefore , we have to be selective about what to focus on . this explains how we sometimes miss other things that are right in front of us . it wasn’t relevant enough at the time . the other way around it explains how we suddenly see the same type of vehicle appear everywhere when we’ve just taken a test drive , or that more women seem to be pregnant now that you’ve been thinking about starting a family . in that sense , it highlights those events that are on top of your mind . confirmation bias the second component is what is called confirmation bias . this concept influences how we interpret and recall information . we are more inclined to gather evidence that supports and emphasizes our beliefs and to dismiss or fail to seek contradictory evidence . now confirmation bias is in itself an interesting to dive into as it plays a role in a variety of highly debated topics ranging from scientific studies to politics , finance , health , religion , etc . for the sake of this article , i will refrain from elaborating too much and revert to the scope . the point is that as you are writing about a particular topic , you will be more inclined to emphasize aspects that are aligned with the point you’re trying to make . collective consciousness apart from the frequency illusion , originality is further influenced by what is called collective consciousness . this concept , developed by the french sociologist émile durkheim refers to the common set of beliefs , ideas , attitudes , and knowledge within a group or society . durkheim concluded that society exists because unique individuals feel a sense of solidarity with each other . the collective consciousness informs our sense of belonging , identity , and behavior . within a group , people are bound to come up with similar thought processes as it reaffirms their sense of belonging . that is why you will find a lot of agreeable opinions , open doors , and repetition to stay in line with the homogeneous character of the group . so what’s the point ? if it’s all been thought out before and we’re so biased based on our attention span and our position in society , why bother stressing about originality ? well , you probably shouldn’t . even though an idea is far more likely to have been thought out before deriving your own opinions and conclusions from , it is a worthwhile exercise . that’s the part where you gain understanding and learn about how to apply the learnings to benefit yourself and others . to paraphrase what the author mark manson wrote in his most recent book “everything is f*cked” and that i find particularly applicable here is “values cannot be changed with reason , only through experience” piling on more information will not aid in standing out sharing your experiences is the added value . knowledge in itself is useless if you don’t know how to apply it .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Whenever I have a moment of revelation about which topic to write about next, it tends to be short-lived. Often, I come across articles that cover similar, if not the exact same, topic or convey the same message. What makes it worse is that these pieces are more eloquently written and contain better examples and quotes. As someone aspiring to be a writer, it can be disheartening and demotivating. After all, writing interesting articles is already a competitive landscape. Why would a reader choose my piece over that of a more accomplished author? This line of thinking is more of a battle against oneself than anything else. The more time spent contemplating it, the higher the likelihood of finding a reason not to publish or abandon an idea.\n\nTo overcome this doubt regarding the value or quality of your work, it is worth exploring where this feeling originates. I have come across a few concepts that explain the psychological processes that could cause this doubt, namely the frequency illusion and collective consciousness.\n\nThe frequency illusion, as mentioned in this article, has already been extensively studied and has been coined the \"Baader-Meinhof phenomenon\" by Stanford linguistics professor Arnold Zwicky. The frequency illusion is a result of two well-known psychological processes: selective attention and confirmation bias. Selective attention refers to how we actively process information in our environment. It involves focusing on a specific task while disregarding other information and stimuli. Attention is a limited resource, so we need to be selective about what we focus on. This explains how we sometimes overlook things that are right in front of us because they were not relevant enough at the time. On the flip side, it also explains how we suddenly notice the same type of vehicle everywhere after taking a test drive, or how more pregnant women seem to be around once we start thinking about starting a family. In this way, it highlights those events that are at the forefront of our minds.\n\nConfirmation bias is the second component and influences how we interpret and recall information. We are inclined to seek out evidence that supports and reinforces our beliefs, while dismissing or overlooking contradictory evidence. Confirmation bias is an intriguing concept that affects various highly debated topics ranging from scientific studies to politics, finance, health, and religion. However, for the purpose of this article, I will refrain from delving too deeply into it and stick to the scope. The point is that as you write about a particular topic, you will be more inclined to emphasize aspects that align with the point you are trying to make.\n\nIn addition to the frequency illusion, originality is also influenced by what is known as collective consciousness. Developed by French sociologist Émile Durkheim, collective consciousness refers to the common set of beliefs, ideas, attitudes, and knowledge within a group or society. Durkheim concluded that society exists because unique individuals feel a sense of solidarity with each other. Collective consciousness informs our sense of belonging, identity, and behavior. Within a group, people are likely to develop similar thought processes as it reaffirms their sense of belonging. This is why you'll often find agreeable opinions, open doors, and repetition to align with the homogeneous character of the group.\n\nSo, what's the point? If everything has already been thought out before and we are biased based on our attention span and our position in society, why should we stress about originality? Well, the truth is, you probably shouldn't. Although an idea is more likely to have been explored before, deriving your own opinions and conclusions from it is still a worthwhile exercise. This is the part where you gain understanding and learn how to apply the knowledge to benefit yourself and others. To paraphrase what author Mark Manson wrote in his recent book \"Everything is F*cked,\" which applies aptly here, \"values cannot be changed with reason, only through experience.\" Accumulating more information alone will not help you stand out. Sharing your experiences is the added value. Knowledge in itself is useless if you don't know how to apply it. END"}

With over 16 years of experience as a web and mobile developer, I have learned the importance of careful consideration before beginning your mobile app journey, whether it's for business supporting apps or stand-alone mobile app services.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that every assumption you make about your mobile app product is false until proven valid. In today's era of building minimum viable products (MVPs) and the adoption of lean startup and agile processes, assuming that developing your mobile app guarantees success has proven to have a 99% chance of failing. Therefore, it is crucial to approach your assumptions with caution and skepticism.\n\nAs an entrepreneur or maker, it is your responsibility to identify which of your assumptions are accurate and which are incorrect. You must also determine how to improve or replace these assumptions with the right ones for your product. Here are some methods to help minimize errors in your assumptions:\n\n1. Scratch your itch: Work on developing an idea that provides a solution to a problem you personally experience or need. By validating if it works for you, you can assess if there is a sufficient number of others who share the same problem, making it a viable idea.\n\n2. Pivoting: Create a simple form of your concept that allows you to demonstrate your solution to others. This can be as basic as an excel sheet, clickable wireframe, mockups, or non-coding examples. If you are a proficient developer, even a simple duct tape proof of concept using your developer stack can suffice. Invest the minimum amount of effort necessary to enable the demonstration of your idea.\n\n3. Landing pages: Utilize a simple website as a platform to showcase the value and purpose of your idea, targeting a specific audience. This will help gauge traction before investing substantial resources into actual development.\n\nIn addition to these strategies, there are valuable books available that can provide you with the appropriate mindset and information to assess the viability of your idea. Coming from a technical background, I can attest to the significance of the following books in shaping my mindset:\n\n1. [Book 1]\n2. [Book 2]\n3. [Book 3]\n\nThese takeaways are instrumental in guiding your approach towards developing a successful mobile app. It is crucial to acknowledge the need to validate assumptions, demonstrate your solution, and assess market interest before fully committing to the development process. By adopting these principles and utilizing the recommended resources, you can improve your chances of creating a viable and prosperous mobile app business. END"}
{"prompt":"a few months ago , i wrote a review of award-winning editor jack hart’s book storycraft the complete guide to writing narrative nonfiction . ( that’s my amazon affiliate link above — i’ll make a small comission if you buy a copy at no extra cost to you . thanks ! ) storycraft is one of my favorite books on the craft of writing ( i share several of my other favorite books in my article here ) . even though hart aimed his book at writers of nonfiction , i believe there is much that writers of fiction can glean from its pages too . in fact , there’s one chapter in particular that’s a goldmine of editing tips for any kind of writing . recently , i collected my top takeaways from the chapter and arranged them as an editing checklist for myself when i work on blog posts , essays , and short stories . i’ve found these tips incredibly helpful so , today , i wanted to share seven of them with you ! these powerful editing tips will help you breathe life into your writing , turn plodding sentences and paragraphs into fast-paced narratives , and capture the attention of your readers . let’s dive in . 1 . get moving in your introduction hart emphasizes the importance of getting moving right out of the block . make sure your opening paragraphs aren’t dry and filled with exposition . instead , they should include a sentence or two that catches your reader’s interest and entices them to read more . hook your readers with action , curiosity , or intrigue . the hook might be the very first sentence in your piece — a real attention grabber like the opening line of george orwell’s 1984 , “it was a bright cold day in april , and the clocks were striking thirteen . ” in my recent memoir essay “expecting the unexpected in new york city” , i followed that approach , opening with this sentence , “during the two-and-a-half years that i went to college in new york city , i witnessed a crime only once . ” however , you can also bury the hook several paragraphs into your piece as i did in my essay “the hidden treasure beneath my library” , and as joan didion did in her essay “some dreamers of the golden dream” when she writes , after three paragraphs , “imagine banyan street first , because banyan is where it happened . ” even if the hook appears several paragraphs into your story or essay , make sure those preceding paragraphs are fast moving . they might even hint that a twist or something else unexpected is coming . and that leads into tip #2 . 2 . push scenes forward with continuous motion scenes should not be stagnant . at the end of a scene , the action should move forward . the characters shouldn’t be glued to their chairs and talking to each other like robots . that will bore our readers to tears ! if you have scenes with dialogue , include descriptions of what the characters are doing while they’re talking . often , this is more effective at revealing what they’re feeling then if you used words like “angrily . ” for example , compare these two sentences “i’m not talking about this , ” he said angrily . “i’m not talking about this , ” he said and slammed the door behind him . when you’re editing your piece , look to see if you’ve included motion to push scenes forward . if you’re writing an informative blog post , this might mean including a story to illustrate a point . 3 . use the language of action are your action scenes as powerful as they could be ? hart points out that the most powerful action words describe causality . for example , let’s say you’re describing a woman driving a car . she tries to swerve out of the way of something in the road . you could write , “the car jerked to the left . ” but hart suggests that it would be more gripping to write , “she jerked the wheel to the left” . it puts us closer to where the action is happening . 4 . write in the active voice with tip #3 in mind , when you edit your piece , make sure you’ve written your sentences in the active voice and not the passive . if your high school grammar is a little rusty , you can read a quick review of passive sentences here . essentially , in a passive sentence , the subject receives the action rather than performing it . for example , politicians and business executives like to use the passive voice when they want to avoid claiming responsibility for a mistake . they might write , “mistakes were made . ” it’s a neat little trick because this sentence avoids taking responsibility by failing to tell us who made the mistakes . note that you can’t fix a passive sentence by tacking the subject onto the end . “mistakes were made by all of us” is still passive . so how to fix it ? just write , “we all made mistakes . ” now the sentence is active . 5 . eliminate unnecessary words in his book on writing well , william zinsser notes , …the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components . every word that serves no function , every long word that could be a short word , every adverb that carries the same meaning that’s already in the verb , every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what–these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence . hart agrees and recommends eliminating the following unnecessary words in order to write strong sentences 1 . progressive tense and auxiliary verbs . write “the wind blows” or “the wind blew” instead of “the wind is blowing” or “the wind had blown . ” 2 . empty words . for example , eliminate “there are” , “there is” , “there was” , “it is” , “it was” . i shared more about empty words in my article here . 3 . beginning of an action . for example , don’t say “he began to race around the room . ” just write , “he raced around the room . ” 6 . use time markers and straight chronology sometimes when you’re writing a narrative , it’s necessary to skip forward or backward in time . however , if you do , be sure you use clear time markers so your readers don’t get confused . if your reader has to stop to try to figure out when something is happening , it will definitely slow down the pace of your narrative . a time marker just means that you write a line explaining when the next scene is going to take place . for example , “none of this would have happened if i hadn’t received that call two days earlier…” or “fast forward three weeks later . ” hart points out that sometimes your time markers can be more subtle , “you might simply note the fall colors on the trees when you open a new scene that jumps ahead from summer to autumn . or you could slip in the height of the sun in the sky when a character walks out of a building . ” he also believes straight chronology is the easiest for readers to follow , so evaluate your piece to see if a flashback really is necessary . sometimes i’ll rearrange paragraphs in my piece because i realize that jumping backward and then forward in time might be confusing to my readers . 7 . speed up , then slow down speed up during the boring parts . slow down during the climatic scenes . how do you speed up ?

While Hart's target audience is nonfiction writers, there are many valuable insights that fiction writers can glean from its pages as well. One particular chapter stands out as a goldmine of editing tips applicable to any type of writing. I have compiled my top takeaways from that chapter into an editing checklist that I use for my own blog posts, essays, and short stories. Today, I would like to share seven of these powerful editing tips with you. By implementing these tips, you'll be able to breathe life into your writing, transforming plodding sentences and paragraphs into fast-paced narratives that capture the attention of your readers. So, let's delve into these tips.\n\n1. Grab the reader's attention in your introduction: Hart emphasizes the significance of starting strong. Avoid dry and exposition-filled opening paragraphs. Instead, include a sentence or two that hooks the reader and entices them to read further. Capture their interest with action, curiosity, or intrigue. Consider incorporating a compelling opening line, like George Orwell's \"1984\": \"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\" Even if your hook appears several paragraphs in, ensure those preceding paragraphs are fast-moving and hint at something unexpected.\n\n2. Keep scenes in motion: Scenes should never be stagnant. At the end of a scene, the action should move forward. Characters should not be rooted to their chairs, engaged in robotic dialogue. To avoid boring readers, include descriptions of what the characters are doing while they speak. This approach can be more effective in conveying their emotions than using adverbs. For example, compare \"I'm not talking about this,\" he said angrily\" to \"I'm not talking about this,\" he said, slamming the door behind him. When editing your work, examine if you have included motion to push scenes forward. If writing an informative blog post, consider including a story to illustrate your point.\n\n3. Harness the language of action: Are your action scenes as powerful as they could be? Hart highlights that the most impactful action words describe causality. For instance, instead of merely stating \"the car jerked to the left,\" make it more gripping by writing \"she jerked the wheel to the left.\" This brings the reader closer to the action.\n\n4. Write in the active voice: When editing, ensure your sentences are written in the active voice rather than the passive, keeping tip #3 in mind. In passive sentences, the subject receives the action rather than performing it. Passive sentences can be evasive, allowing the writer to avoid taking responsibility. For example, instead of \"mistakes were made,\" prefer \"we all made mistakes.\" The latter sentence is active and takes ownership.\n\n5. Eliminate unnecessary words: As William Zinsser notes in his book \"On Writing Well,\" the secret to good writing is stripping every sentence to its essence. Unnecessary words weaken the strength of a sentence. When editing, remove progressive tense, auxiliary verbs, empty words (e.g., \"there are,\" \"there is\"), and phrases indicating the beginning of an action. Simplify your sentences for clarity and impact.\n\n6. Maintain clear time markers and use straight chronology: If you need to skip forward or backward in time, use clear time markers to prevent reader confusion. When readers struggle to determine the timeline, it hampers the pace of your narrative. Time markers can be explicit, indicating a shift in time, or subtle, such as describing changes in season or the position of the sun. Straight chronology is often easiest for readers to follow, so consider whether a flashback is truly necessary and rearrange paragraphs accordingly.\n\n7. Vary the pace: Speed up during less exciting parts, and slow down during climactic scenes. In sections with exposition, ensure you are only conveying essential information. Ask yourself if paragraphs of description or backstory are necessary. Conversely, in moments of high tension, slow down the pace of your writing to create suspense. This can be achieved through shorter sentences, utilizing pauses within the scene, and incorporating more paragraph breaks. Varying sentence structure will give your writing a breathless quality.\n\nBy incorporating these seven editing tips into your writing process, you will instantly make your work more engaging and fast-paced. Your writing will hold the attention of your readers more effectively, allowing you to share your message with the world. If you're seeking to strengthen your writing and storytelling skills further, I highly recommend getting a copy of Hart's book. It offers in-depth insights and actionable advice that will elevate your writing to new heights. END"}

They consist of a sequence of amino acids arranged in a specific structure. While scientists have been able to accurately determine the amino acid sequence for many years, accurately predicting the protein's structure has proven to be a challenging task. Understanding the protein structure holds several important functions. Accurate predictions enable us to better comprehend the biological evolution of a specific protein, identify the diseases it may cause, and determine its defensive capabilities against other diseases. Comprehensive knowledge of protein structure is key to comprehending the functions of proteins and cells, as well as the malfunctions that can lead to diseases. This understanding is crucial in the development of treatments and vaccines.\n\nAn illustrative example is the SARS-CoV-2 virus, where the spike protein structure is responsible for attaching to the ACE2 receptor in our cells, resulting in infection. Our rapid progress in understanding and predicting protein structures has allowed us to gain insights into this virus quickly. This field began evolving decades ago when Christian B. Anfinsen's seminal work in 1972 demonstrated that accurately computing the amino acid sequence could help deduce protein structure, earning him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Max Perutz further advanced this knowledge by utilizing x-ray crystallography nearly 60 years ago to determine the precise structures of myoglobin and hemoglobin. This breakthrough shed light on the true function of hemoglobin, which is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and cells in our blood. Understanding the structure of these proteins also revealed how a single amino acid change can lead to diseases like sickle cell anemia.\n\nIn modern times, decoding the amino acid sequence and completing the sequence accurately has become more advanced due to the progress made in genome sequencing. These experimental techniques, like x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance, play a vital role in determining the 3D structure of the protein. However, they can be inefficient, time-consuming, and expensive.\n\nIndia has also made significant contributions to the field of protein structure work, with G.N. Ramachandran developing the Ramachandran plot, a model globally used by scientists to understand protein structures. In 1994, John Moult introduced the CASP technique (Critical Assessment for Protein Structure Prediction), which provides a comparative model for predicting protein structures.\n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized protein structure prediction. In 2018, DeepMind, a company, utilized AI and deep learning to develop a predictive algorithm that accurately predicts protein structure. This breakthrough technology has greatly enhanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and has facilitated the accelerated development of vaccines.\n\nIn conclusion, the advances made in predicting protein structure using artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms have transformed our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and expedited the development of vaccines.

of attending the Next conference in San Francisco, where Google presented its vision for the future of Google Cloud in front of an audience of 25,000 people. The vast amount of material conveyed during the event provided valuable insights into Google's strategy and direction.\n\nOne key takeaway from the conference was the acknowledgment that only a small fraction of potential workloads have been migrated to the public cloud. This statistic underscores the fact that Amazon has dominated the early phases of public cloud adoption. However, Google and other competitors are actively working to challenge this dominance and seize the opportunity that still remains.\n\nA significant focus of the conference was Google's commitment to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The message surrounding AI has evolved to be more measured and nuanced, with an emphasis on enhancing experiences rather than leading to the dystopian scenarios often portrayed in popular culture. In particular, conversational AI in call centers was highlighted as an imminent application, with Dialogflow introducing features such as phone gateway and sentiment analysis. This opens up possibilities for companies to create cost-effective, AI-enabled triage processes for better customer engagement outcomes.\n\nGoogle also showcased several advancements in its AI offerings, including Cloud Vision API projects and AutoML Vision. AutoML Vision particularly stands out as a tool that allows for improved accuracy in vision models without the need for an extensive team of data engineers and scientists. Additionally, the deployment of the new Mobile Edge TPU processors with TensorFlow Lite provides real-time feedback and machine learning capabilities for industries such as mining and manufacturing.\n\nDuring a business transformation workshop, I had the opportunity to participate in discussions on expanding the impact of Wildbook, a platform that utilizes crowd-sourced video and camera phone images to track individual animals. This platform, powered by a combination of GCP Cloud ML APIs and custom TensorFlow models, enables the mapping of endangered species and their interactions with humans. The open-source nature of Wildbook makes it accessible for aspiring data scientists to explore and contribute.\n\nAnother area where Google has a significant advantage is in data tooling, particularly with its BigQuery offering. The conference highlighted continuous improvements and new features being added to BigQuery, including advancements in machine learning and geolocation. BigQuery's power and ease of use make it an attractive platform for marketing data purposes, enabling companies to ingest and process various data sources for personalized customer journeys and improved outcomes. Furthermore, Google's focus on data privacy was addressed with the introduction of the Data Loss Prevention API, which provides scanning, redaction, and tokenization of sensitive data in both static and streaming data.\n\nThe conference also featured impressive developments in the field of application development, with Kelsey Hightower showcasing Google's natural engineering flair. Cloud Build and Knative serverless containers were highlighted as tools that enhance the speed and ease of developing, testing, deploying, and running code. Google's commitment to open-source projects, such as Spring Cloud and Go-Cloud, makes their platform capabilities more accessible for development teams.\n\nFor companies that have a hybrid approach with development and production environments in both the cloud and on-premises data centers, Google's GKE on-prem provides a runtime bridge to support this pattern. This combination of Kubernetes, Istio, and GKE on-prem offers a unified cloud services platform that enables seamless integration between cloud and on-premises infrastructure.\n\nSecurity was also a prominent topic at the conference, with Google addressing enterprise security concerns through VPC service controls and Istio. VPC service controls allow for increased security within a virtual private cloud, while Istio provides a policy-managed approach to secure service interactions. This capability is particularly relevant for organizations in the financial services industry, which have built their own service mesh or secure networking capabilities. Istio offers an open-source solution to meet this need, and its integration with Google's cloud services platform makes it easy to operate.\n\nOverall, Diane Greene and her team successfully outlined their roadmap for Google Cloud at Next. It is clear that as the announced features and capabilities become generally available over the next 12 months, Google Cloud will offer a comprehensive end-to-end public cloud solution. The challenge now lies in effectively marketing and convincing customers to embrace Google Cloud. \n\nOn a personal note, I had the pleasure of participating in a panel discussion on running a successful cloud practice during the conference. Outside of the event, I also observed some interesting cultural changes in San Francisco, such as the use of the term \"mobile\" instead of \"cell\" when referring to phones. I also noticed a stark contrast between the opulent Salesforce office towers and the poverty evident on the streets, reminding me of the inequality that persists in the city. END"}

Quality writing, effective formatting, submission to reputable publications, and even writing frequency all play a role in this pursuit. However, one aspect that often gets overlooked but is crucial in grabbing attention is the headline.\n\nThink of applying for a job as a point of comparison. You may possess the relevant experience and skills, which is equivalent to producing quality content. You have diligently submitted your CV, similar to submitting your work to publications. Whether you have applied to multiple positions or just a few, the frequency of your writing is also a factor. Sometimes you are fortunate and secure an interview, while at other times, you receive no response. This can be compared to the engagement you receive on your articles, such as claps, shares, reads, and comments.\n\nNow, imagine attending an interview ill-prepared. Consider showing up in your pajamas, hair disheveled, remnants of drool staining your mouth, and an unbrushed appearance. Your body language exudes a lack of confidence and disrespect, with your eyes avoiding all contact. Although you may have made an effort to wear suitable shoes, it is evident that you have neglected to make a positive first impression. Similarly, neglecting to craft compelling headlines is just as detrimental. It is akin to arriving at an interview fully equipped with knowledge and skills, yet failing to dress appropriately and establish a positive initial impression. This approach is likely to sabotage your chances of success, and you may even be escorted out of the building by security.\n\nIn reality, investing time and effort into writing regularly, incorporating appropriate tags, and submitting to reputable publications will be in vain if you fail to pay attention to your headline. Regardless of how diligently you have worked on your article, report, presentation, ad, or TED talk, it will all be in vain if your target audience—readers, curators, editors, colleagues, prospects, or customers—ignore it. Additionally, you will miss out on various opportunities by not optimizing your headlines. This includes the potential for increased readership, financial benefits from sponsorships, as well as being admired and respected within your field. Moreover, you will miss out on invitations that can propel you toward the realization of your dreams and aspirations. By neglecting your headlines, you deny the world the benefits of the insights you possess, insights that could improve their work, relationships, writing, and even their health. Furthermore, you will miss out on establishing connections with individuals who can relate to you, trust you, and confide in you. Ultimately, failing to make an impact despite possessing the ability to do so can leave you feeling unnoticed, lacking energy, and unfulfilled.\n\nTo conclude, while various elements contribute to achieving success in writing, it is essential not to disregard the significance of compelling headlines. Taking the time to create attention-grabbing headlines ensures that your valuable content earns the attention it deserves. By doing so, you increase your chances of being recognized, respected, and even rewarded for your efforts. So, don't underestimate the power of a well-crafted headline in making a difference in people's lives with your words, and capturing the attention of those who can benefit from your work. END"}

powered product innovation using big data , product development can be done in a more evidence based manner . two of the main product features that would be desirable for circular economy are modularity and durability . the benefits of greater durability is obvious by itself , on the other hand , modularity means to decompose a complex product engineering process into simple subparts . greater modularity could then make product remanufacturing and recycling more convenient , it “permit the arrangement of components in a manner that can be easily modified , enhanced , exchanged , or proliferated . ” ( tucker j . marion , 2010 ) during the process of product development , data can be collected from prototyping and testing of the product . these data can now be analyzed iteratively through machine learning algorithms , which assists with the evaluation of these desirable sustainable product features and could be used to improve upon current design of products 3 . blockchain and cryptographic anchoring for supply chain management another challenge in tracking and recognizing environmental impact of businesses is the difficulties in reliably following and trace back to the source of its inputs . what blockchain could do is to make the whole supply chain “transparent” , where each stage in the chain is recorded in an immutable way . imagine you operate a small restaurant , to provide tasty dishes to customers , you would need to purchase the ingredients . to make it simpler , let’s only focus on the meat supplier . in order to know whether the meat supplier is operating in an ethical and sustainable production process , you need to know which livestock farm did they get their “inputs” from . if you would like to dig deeper , you might also want to know the source of the food they fed to the livestock . this could quickly get complex and difficult to track , and that is indeed a general concern of many businesses , especially for those that have to manage a large variety of suppliers , such as walmart . indeed , walmart was one of the earliest adopters to test the application of supply chain management using blockchain by using it to trace pork in china , to authenticate transactions and facilitate accurate and efficient record keeping . example of blockchain digital supply chain ( oliver wyman ) — copyright © 2018 , oliver wyman 4 . smart

last mile delivery is substantial , with potential of reducing delivery costs by 10% comparing to traditional delivery method ( mckinsey , 2018 ) . the design of the fastest route reduced the amount of pollutants created by shipping vehicles , especially for oversea shipping , while autonomous delivery act as a solution to effective , low manual input delivery , allowing more funds and human resources to be devoted to more productive usage .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The business potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in promoting the circular economy is significant. From environmental impact analysis and monitoring to smart inventory management, AI offers various solutions that can help businesses achieve their environmental and social responsibilities more effectively.\n\nOne area where AI can make a significant impact is in environmental impact analysis and monitoring. Many businesses strive to reduce their environmental footprint but struggle to accurately estimate the effect of their activities. This is particularly challenging for large businesses involved in multiple production and distribution chains. However, the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart sensors can automate accurate data collection, which can then be fed into data analytic algorithms to analyze various sources of externalities or pollutants. By gaining insights from these analyses, businesses can take targeted actions to reduce their environmental impact. For example, identifying the greatest source of residuals or pollutants in a manufacturing procedure could lead to investments in more efficient production methods.\n\nBig data also plays a crucial role in promoting the circular economy. Using big data, product development can be done in a more evidence-based manner. Two desirable product features for a circular economy are modularity and durability. Greater durability leads to longer product lifecycles, while modularity allows for easier remanufacturing and recycling. Through the iterative analysis of data collected during the product development process, machine learning algorithms assist in evaluating and improving these sustainable product features.\n\nBlockchain technology can enhance supply chain management by providing transparency and traceability. Tracking and recognizing the environmental impact of businesses can be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple suppliers. However, blockchain can record each stage of the supply chain in an immutable manner, making it easier to trace back to the source of inputs. This level of transparency can help businesses ensure ethical and sustainable production processes throughout the supply chain.\n\nSmart inventory management is another area where AI can contribute to the circular economy. Accurately predicting customer demand enables businesses to produce the right amount of products at the right time, minimizing wasteful stockpiling and excess inventories. AI's prediction capabilities, driven by internal data such as past sales records and external data like market demand fluctuations, can optimize inventory management, reduce costs, and lower waste produced by unsold products.\n\nFurthermore, AI's capabilities in optimizing delivery and shipping logistics can have a significant impact on the circular economy. AI can analyze customer order data and real-time traffic data to design the most efficient routes for shipping and delivery. Additionally, autonomous shipping and delivery solutions present opportunities for cost savings and reduced environmental impact. For example, the use of autonomous trucks in last-mile delivery can substantially lower delivery costs and reduce pollutants created by shipping vehicles.\n\nIn conclusion, AI offers immense potential for promoting the circular economy in various areas, including environmental impact analysis, product development, supply chain management, inventory management, and delivery optimization. By leveraging AI technologies, businesses can enhance their environmental and social responsibilities while improving their operational efficiency and reducing waste. END"}

In today's era, where an overwhelming abundance of content saturates our screens, the challenge of inciting thoughts and provoking meaningful engagement is more daunting than ever before. However, it is crucial for writers to rise above this sea of mediocrity and make their ideas resonate within the minds of their audience.\n\nIn 2012, Seth Godin astutely observed that we have entered a time where traditional markers of credibility, financial resources, and sheer influence pale in comparison to a single, fundamental question: \"Do I genuinely care about what you have to say?\" This sentiment holds true today, and as writers, we must acknowledge its significance. The focus should not solely be on writing itself, but rather on the act of stimulating deep contemplation and fostering meaningful connections through our words.\n\nIt is vital to recognize that attention is a scarce resource in this era of information overload. Mere proficiency in writing will not capture readers' attention; instead, novelty is the key. The right selection of words pales in comparison to the power of a compelling narrative. A skilled writer is one who can discern what has been overlooked, immersing themselves in unexplored territories of thought. The path less traveled often leads to the most captivating stories.\n\nWhile this may appear to be a formidable task, fear not. The solutions to attaining impactful writing are not as complex as they may seem. Here are some fundamental practices to guide you along the path of captivating your audience.\n\nFirst and foremost, immerse yourself in the world of your readers. Understand their desires, interests, and concerns. By comprehending their innermost yearnings, you can identify the gaps in their knowledge and experiences. By doing so, you position yourself as the guide, unveiling captivating perspectives and insights that are otherwise unseen.\n\nFurthermore, embrace the power of storytelling to its fullest extent. Craft narratives that transport your readers to unexplored realms of possibility. Paint vivid imagery and evoke emotions through words.

\n\nSeeking comfort in familiar activities has always been my refuge. From rewatching the same TV shows to rereading beloved books, and listening to my favorite songs on repeat, my routine serves as an escape from the chaotic whirlwind inside my own mind. Although each person's experience with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is unique, there are commonalities that connect many individuals. Most adults with ADHD may not appear hyperactive externally, but internally, their minds are in constant motion.\n\nWhen I lay my head on the pillow, my brain begins somersaulting, bombarding me with intrusive thoughts. Memories of past mistakes resurface, replaying embarrassing moments like when I unintentionally made a girl cry in sixth grade or when I uttered an inappropriate phrase during a job interview. The recollection of awkward incidents, such as the time I consumed too much champagne on a date and ended up running out of a theater, also resurfaces. Yet, it is the half-formed, grandiose ideas that populate my mind the most. Ideas for work projects, writing a new book, or planning the hypothetical nursery for a future child tangle and bounce around within my brain like balls in a lottery machine. The ADHD brain operates with a limited team, struggling to find a place for all the thoughts and possibilities that flood the mind.\n\nBlocking out external stimuli is another challenge for those with ADHD. Those of us with ADHD often have heightened senses, making it difficult to filter out excessive stimulation. Shirt tags irritate me, and unexpected physical contact can be jarring. Loud music in the morning overwhelms me, and even the faint glow of a charging phone disrupts my sleep as I position it face down on my nightstand. I seek solace in ambient noise during nighttime, using white noise machines or oscillating fans to drown out household sounds. The tick-tock of a clock becomes a torment, and I fear boisterous neighbors with deep voices. Occasionally, the hypersensitivity associated with ADHD leads us to avoid crowded or noisy environments, finding sanctuary in activities such as video games, where we can control the level of sensory input we receive.\n\nDespite these challenges, I have established beneficial habits to navigate the complexities of ADHD. Regular medication, daily to-do lists, and sticky notes adorning my desk help me stay organized. I have learned not to listen to music while working, as it becomes too distracting. Instead, a trusty fan acts as a buffer, muffling the internal chatter of my mind. My workspace is filled with overlapping projects, reflecting the ADHD tendency to struggle with visualizing tasks from beginning to end. I follow one thread, pick up others along the way, and before I know it, I am holding a tangled ball of unfinished endeavors. With time, however, I have developed the patience to untangle one thread at a time. In the past, without effective time management, deadlines would suddenly loom, and I would find last-minute motivation to deliver a final product. I often felt like the hare, aimlessly wandering between bursts of focused energy. Nevertheless, I have discovered how to tap into a particular ADHD trait called hyperfocus. When engaged in a task I enjoy, I can lose myself completely, losing track of time and emerging hours later. This immersive state serves as a positive indicator of my passion for my work. Yet, hyperfocus can result in a neglected home environment and occasional lapses in self-care, such as forgetting to eat lunch.\n\nIn a neurotypical brain, the corpus striatum serves as the executive team responsible for regulating the brain's reward pathway. It filters thoughts and emotions, determining their priority and urgency. Some items demand immediate attention, others can wait, while many are discarded as irrelevant. By contrast, the ADHD brain works with a short-staffed team, where everything, even the trivial, holds equal importance. Stimulant medications aim to support this team by helping the striatum discern the most critical task from a myriad of competing thoughts. However, an inherent feature of the ADHD brain is its proficiency at distinguishing desired activities from undesired ones. Dopamine, the brain's reward chemical, plays a pivotal role in motivation. Individuals with ADHD often require more dopamine to feel satisfied or happy, a condition known as Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS). This imbalance in the reward pathway makes it challenging to summon the willpower needed to accomplish mundane yet essential tasks. This can manifest in novelty-seeking behavior, with some individuals engaging in risk-taking activities, impulsive behaviors, or substance abuse in search of a more substantial dopamine boost. Recognizing this aspect of ADHD is crucial, as it helps dispel the misconception that lack of willpower or laziness is to blame. It all comes down to brain chemistry, and our desire for that elusive dopamine carrot.\n\nHowever, not every ADHD brain craves adrenaline. Some individuals, who have hypersensitive ADHD characteristics, may experience a perpetual state of sensory overload. With an inability to compartmentalize stimuli, these individuals may avoid crowded or noisy environments. To find solace, they often retreat to activities that provide controlled sensory input, such as video games. Personally, I find myself combining elements of both hypersensitivity and novelty-seeking behavior. I am willing to take thrilling risks, such as cliff jumping or roller coaster rides, but I also understand the need to regain control over stimulation levels. To find balance, I gravitate towards familiar and comforting activities during overwhelming times. However, during those moments, suggestions of novel experiences only exacerbate the feeling of bombardment and stress. To find my dopamine boost and escape the chaos, I indulge in repetitive rituals like rewatching Lord of the Rings while playing Candy Crush, listening to the same playlist during workouts, practicing the piano with well-known pieces, or diving into the Harry Potter series for the umpteenth time. These behaviors align with the psychology of ADHD and the need to self-soothe. Psychiatrist Ned Hallowell describes it as an \"itch\" that people with ADHD scratch in various ways. Some of these ways, like engaging in creative endeavors, physical exercise, or maintaining close relationships, are adaptive and beneficial. However, compulsive activities, substance abuse, and excessive screen time fall into the category of maladaptive responses. These behaviors offer temporary relief but do not address the underlying challenges of ADHD.\n\nIt is important to note that these behaviors often extend into adulthood for individuals with ADHD. Each escape is also an entrance, as we immerse ourselves in different worlds or experiences, momentarily leaving behind the demands of daily life. When watching television, we enter the world of the characters; as we embark on amusement park rides, we feel the excitement of the adventure. Even when turning to substances, we enter a temporary realm created by their effects. For individuals with ADHD, there is no true escape into nothingness.\n\nDespite the chaos and challenges linked to ADHD, there are remarkable strengths that accompany this condition. People with ADHD possess an exceptional ability to channel their energy into creative pursuits, such as writing, journalism, music, design, teaching, or freelance work. We possess an insatiable desire to chase what brings us happiness, often prioritizing our passions over societal expectations. With the right support systems, healthy habits, and effective communication, individuals with ADHD can lead incredibly fulfilling lives. Perhaps we are the ones who have figured out the essence of living: seeking what makes us genuinely happy, rather than conforming to societal pressures.\n\nIn an ideal world, more people would embrace this paradigm of seeking happiness. Moving away from the notion of what one is supposed to do, and instead following what truly ignites joy from within. In that sense, individuals with ADHD offer a valuable perspective and reminder that life is meant to be lived authentically. END"}

It is important to avoid adding to the negativity that already exists online and refrain from approaching your writing with a \"woe is me\" attitude. Instead, focus on your own passion for writing and whether you find it worth your time. Comparing yourself to other writers and wondering why they achieve success faster than you will only drain your energy and hinder your progress.\n\nRather than fixating on why others seem undeserving of their success, channel your energy into improving your own writing. Recognize that true growth comes from comparing your present self to your past self, rather than comparing yourself to others. Reflect on how you have evolved as a writer over time and set goals for where you want to be in the future. Keep sustained effort and dedication in your writing journey, and you will witness exponential growth in your writing life.\n\nWhen you find yourself falling into the comparison trap or experiencing imposter syndrome, ask yourself what you truly want and what you can do to improve your writing skills. Take tangible actions, such as reading books on writing or enrolling in writing classes, to challenge yourself and enhance your abilities. Cultivate a practice of writing every day to consistently push yourself and strive for improvement. END"}

Followers, claps, likes, and views, despite their apparent significance, all share a common characteristic - they are distractions. These metrics divert our attention away from the very reason we began writing in the first place: to create high-quality content that can be enjoyed by all. In a world already overflowing with countless distractions, our faces constantly glued to our cell phones, the demands of our jobs to sustain us, and a barrage of social media notifications vying for our attention, it is easy to become overwhelmed, undermining the artistic integrity of our work.\n\nThis overwhelming feeling is exacerbated when we allow it to interfere with our role as writers. Regardless of whether we write out of passion or with the intention of generating revenue, maintaining creative control over our work is always paramount. When we allow superficial constructs such as followers and claps to dictate the value of our writing, we inadvertently compromise its essence. No matter what we produce, it will never feel good enough because our focus is continuously fixated on external validation, rather than allowing our creativity to flourish. At this stage, we cease to be writers and become mere entertainers pandering to the masses.\n\nI, too, have personally grappled with this predicament. Only recently have I begun to transcend the overwhelming pressure and prioritize my writing. I can relate to the struggle of having numerous unfinished drafts, plagued by the fear that none of them will ever meet the standards set by others. This ongoing battle has persisted for the past three months, constituting a constant challenge in my life. For instance, one may begin writing with a glimmer of hope, only to lose momentum when faced with the reality of having few followers and negligible claps on past articles. Perhaps one publishes an article, only to be met with silence — no notifications on the Medium app. Gradually, interest wanes, and doubts arise about the investment of time and effort. This struggle for validation may resonate with others as well.\n\nRecently, upon reaching my twenty-sixth birthday, I experienced an epiphany. If I truly aspire to become a great writer, I must do so for myself alone, without seeking validation from others. To this end, I would like to share some tactics that can help one break free from the shackles of external approval and redirect their focus to the aspect that truly matters: writing high-quality, impactful content.\" END"}

As someone who has experienced both sides of the spectrum - religiously waking up early and deliberately avoiding it - I can understand the arguments made on each side. After careful consideration, however, I have concluded that while waking up early can be beneficial, it is not necessary to be productive.\n\nPublications such as Business Insider, Inc. Magazine, and Fast Company have recently published articles highlighting how waking up early can actually be detrimental to productivity. While waking up early may demonstrate personal discipline and ambition, it is not a definitive key to success. It is important to remember why forcing yourself to wake up early may not be helpful for you:\n\n1. Resentment towards following the 5 am crowd: Most people begin waking up early not because it aligns with their desire to get a head start on the day, but because they have heard of a successful person who practices it. However, blindly following the crowd can lead to resenting oneself and the act of waking up early every day, regardless of the circumstances. Waking up early requires consistency and effort, and without a solid purpose, it can become a burdensome and meaningless habit.\n\n2. Deprivation of sunlight: It may not be immediately apparent, but waking up early before the sun rises can mean spending an extended period in darkness. For individuals who thrive on social interaction and require sunlight for their overall well-being, this can have a negative impact on their mental health. Studies have shown that sunlight exposure plays a role in enhancing both physical and emotional well-being, making it particularly important in the mornings.\n\n3. Neglecting the importance of quality sleep: Waking up early in itself is not inherently detrimental. However, problems arise when the focus shifts from obtaining high-quality sleep to prioritizing early waking. While some people can function with less than the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep, most individuals require adequate rest for optimal functioning. Consistently waking up at 5 am without sufficient sleep not only deprives oneself of rest but also reinforces the false notion that sleep is not significant.\n\n4. Impact on social life: Committing to a 5 am wake-up call can potentially restrict social interactions and activities that take place late in the evening. It can limit flexibility and force individuals to decline invitations or miss out on spending time with loved ones. Prioritizing personal routines over meaningful social connections is a trade-off that may not always be worth it.\n\n5. Embracing a different kind of productivity at night: Each individual has a unique genetic makeup that determines whether they are morning people or night owls. For those naturally inclined towards being active and productive during the evening hours, rejecting the trend of waking up at 5 am may, in fact, be the best decision to enhance long-term productivity. Personally, I have found value in both waking up early and staying up late, depending on the season of life. However, I have noticed that during the evening, when the day winds down, my mind becomes more relaxed and creative, allowing for a different kind of productivity.\n\nIn conclusion, while waking up early can have its advantages, it is essential to consider individual preferences, lifestyle, and overall well-being. Waking up at 5 am is not a prerequisite for productivity, and forcing oneself to follow this trend without proper justification may lead to resentment, sleep deprivation, and a lack of balance in social interactions. The key is to find a routine that suits one's natural rhythm and supports overall productivity and well-being. END"}

adults to join the next global climate strike in september , a momentum is taking shape and open an opportunity to push governments to act against climate change . “now that people are aware of the existential threat of climate change , we must give them solutions” people have a lot of energy and are eager to change the status quo , but how do we channel this energy to have the biggest impact ? that is the question asked by tim christophersen , focal point for the un decade project for land restoration . in a webinar last week on land restoration , he stressed that everybody has a role to play in this mass movement but not everybody knows what to do . for example , people can plant the wrong trees at a bad time , bad place and the tree can die , and once a farmer experience failure , he will never plant a tree again . tim christophersen highlighted that “the momentum comes after many years of work in land restoration , and that now we have a large knowledge about terrestrial ecosystem restoration but also marine ecosystem restoration like mangroves and coral reefs . now that people are aware of the existential threat of climate change , we must give them solutions and shift negative views to the opportunities we have” . “inspiring action by measuring the potential of land restoration to stop climate change” thomas crowther and jean francois bastin , two researchers from the university eth zurich explained the goal of their research “inspiring action by measuring the potential of land restoration to stop climate change” . with such measure , people can understand the size of the problem and how they can contribute to solve it . at the webinar organized by the global landscape forum , thomas crowther gave an interesting example “there are 300 extra gigaton of co2 in the atmosphere , this is the size of the problem . if everybody stops to eat meat , it is 66 gigaton which will not be emitted” . the two researchers did the same kind of calculation for land restoration around the globe using geospatial and ecological data . they have mapped how much tree can grow in each part of the world . the model they developed was based on the biophysical data of protected areas . then , they extrapolated to all the globe to see how much trees could grow around the globe . this model finally gave information about the potential of land restoration to reduce climate change . when everybody thinks about geoengineering and technological solutions , people forget that natural solutions are also an option . according to the results of the research which will be published next month in science , jean francois bastin affirms that ecosystem restoration will be the first climate solution in the world . “…because planting trees is not the only way to restore a land” to uncover the potential of land restoration , there are many challenges to overcome . mathilde iweins , an expert of ecosystem services and local finance at the fao , listed 7 challenges to widely implement land restoration . first , many countries lack of coordination between their stakeholders within governments and ministries . planning must be more integrative and in agreement with the people doing restoration otherwise new infrastructure may be built on a restored area . second , land tenure issues must be solved , and farmers should receive land titles otherwise they will not be motivated to care and restore the land . third , trainings about new types of land restoration must be created and shared because planting trees is not the only way to restore a land . forth , restoration must be linked to livelihood so people can see the benefits they can receive through land restoration . fifth , financial partnership must be created as the public sector cannot tackle the problem by itself . the private sector must be involved and see the economic benefits of land restoration . sixth , biophysical and social effect of land restoration must be monitored , evaluated and linked to a cost-benefit analysis . such analysis will show investors the benefits to restore degraded land . lastly , restoration does not happen fast , and time will be needed . in a system where international donors expect results after 4 years restoration project does not have enough time . fortunately , restoration projects are already ongoing and international donors have already invested 50 million usd to start a dozen of projects in 10 countries . these projects which were developed in the same way , are part of an initiative of global knowledge sharing and capacity building . all these projects use the same monitoring and evaluation methods as well as the same set of biophysical and social indicators . thanks to that , these projects are generating comparable data about their benefits and challenges so we can improve the implementation and financing of future projects . “it is a crucial and cheap tool we can use to solve climate change” there is a lot to be learnt as there is no golden bullet , and land restoration is a constant experimentation . countries , especially in the global south , will need assistance to carry on large-scale restoration projects . they will have to learn how to use geospatial data and online platforms to find the suitable land to restore . if we can manage all the challenges and harness the potential of land restoration , it is a crucial and cheap tool we can use to solve climate change .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Land degradation is a pressing global issue that impacts over 3.2 billion people worldwide. When land is degraded through processes like soil erosion, salinization, or pollution, it not only loses its wildlife and ecosystems, but also its ability to provide valuable services. In order to ensure a sustainable future, it is crucial to rehabilitate degraded landscapes and seascape to restore their productivity. In addition to restoring productivity, land restoration plays a vital role in mitigating climate change, as forests, coral reefs, and wetlands have the capacity to store a significant amount of carbon.\n\nAs the younger generation takes to the streets to demand climate action and urges adults to join the upcoming global climate strike in September, a powerful momentum is building, presenting an opportunity to push governments to take action against climate change. Tim Christophersen, the focal point for the UN Decade Project for Land Restoration, poses an important question: how can we channel this energy to have the maximum impact? He emphasizes that everyone has a role to play in this movement, but not everyone is aware of what steps to take. For instance, if people plant the wrong trees at the wrong time and in the wrong place, the trees may die, leading to a farmer's discouragement and reluctance to plant trees in the future.\n\nChristophersen highlights that the current momentum is the result of years of work in land restoration, leading to a wealth of knowledge about terrestrial and marine ecosystem restoration, including mangroves and coral reefs. With the increasing awareness of the existential threat of climate change, it becomes imperative to provide people with solutions and shift their negative views to the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nThomas Crowther and Jean Francois Bastin, researchers from the University of ETH Zurich, emphasize the importance of inspiring action by quantifying the potential of land restoration in combating climate change. By understanding the scale of the problem and how individuals can contribute to its solution, people can be motivated to take meaningful action. Crowther provides an example, stating that if everyone stops eating meat, it could prevent the emission of 66 gigatons of CO2, showcasing the immense impact of individual actions.\n\nTo assess the potential of land restoration, Crowther and Bastin developed a model based on geospatial and ecological data, mapping the growth potential of trees in different parts of the world. This model demonstrates the incredible potential that land restoration holds in reducing climate change. In focusing on natural solutions, it becomes essential to remember that geoengineering and technological solutions are not the sole options.\n\nHowever, to fully unleash the potential of land restoration, several challenges need to be addressed. Mathilde Iweins, an expert on ecosystem services and local finance at the FAO, identifies seven key challenges in implementing wide-scale land restoration. These include the need for better coordination between stakeholders within governments and ministries, resolution of land tenure issues to motivate farmers to care for and restore the land, the creation and dissemination of training on various land restoration methods beyond tree planting, linking restoration efforts to livelihoods, the necessity of financial partnerships involving the private sector, monitoring and evaluating the biophysical and social impact of restoration, and recognizing that restoration is a time-consuming process that requires patience and long-term commitment.\n\nThankfully, restoration projects are already underway, with international donors investing $50 million in a dozen projects across ten countries. These projects follow a standardized approach, enabling the generation of comparable data on their benefits and challenges. This knowledge will help improve the implementation and financing of future projects in a global initiative of knowledge sharing and capacity building.\n\nAs land restoration is a constant experiment, there is much to be learned, and no single solution exists. Countries, particularly in the global south, will require assistance to carry out large-scale restoration projects. They will need to learn how to utilize geospatial data and online platforms to identify suitable land for restoration. Overcoming the challenges and harnessing the potential of land restoration is crucial, as it is a cost-effective tool that can play a significant role in combating climate change. END"}

Boyé, a former member of the prestigious Mormon Tabernacle Choir, recently made headlines for his participation in an anti-gay marriage event. Since then, he has reflected upon his past actions and expressed remorse for any harm caused. Boyé's upcoming concert seeks to combat the distressing issue of suicide, which is believed to be linked to the marginalization experienced by the LGBTQ+ community within Utah's predominant culture. In a video released by Boyé himself, he explains his deep conviction in the importance of fighting against suicide. Inspired to write a song called \"Bend Not Break,\" Boyé's dedication to the cause became even more evident when he requested music engineers to work on the song on the one-year anniversary of a dear friend's tragic suicide. Boyé's impactful music video on suicide prevention, shot in Herriman, Utah, has garnered support from the local community and therapists alike, who have found it valuable in their patient care. Boyé described the profound impact his music has had, recounting a powerful testimonial of a young woman who was moved to overcome self-harm after listening to his song. He emphasized the significance of such stories, considering them to be beyond his wildest dreams. The release of \"Bend Not Break\" has been hailed as a defining moment in Boyé's career by his colleagues, and it has become a beacon of hope for those battling suicidal thoughts. To access further support or engage with others who share similar experiences, individuals can connect with the Utah Valley Postmormons through their various social events on Facebook and Meetup. It is important to extend our support to initiatives like Boyé's and help shine a light on the crucial issue of suicide prevention. END"}

FTPIngestion Class\n\nLet's now discuss each section of our FTPIngestion class in detail.\n\nInit Method (Constructor):\nThe init method, also known as the constructor, is called when we create an object of our FTPIngestion class. During object creation, all the attributes are set. The values for each attribute are fetched from the config.py class, where their values have been defined. We import the config.py file as 'cfg' and set each attribute with its corresponding value.\n\nInit Method Recommendation:\nInstead of using the config.py class, we can use AWS SSM (Systems Manager Parameter Store) to define our key-value pairs for each attribute. This approach is more robust and secure.\n\ncreate_ssh_connection Method:\nThis method creates a secure SSH connection with our FTP server using the provided credentials. On successful connection, it sets the 'self.ssh_ok' attribute to true and returns. If the connection fails, 'self.ssh_ok' is set to false and returned. One thing to note in this method is the line 'self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.autoaddpolicy())', where we configure it to set missing host keys with an auto-generated policy. If you are running this code in AWS Glue as a Python shell job, instead of adding the auto-add policy, use the host policies. To do this, comment out the line 'self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.autoaddpolicy())' and uncomment the line 'self.ssh_client.load_system_host_keys()'.\n\ncreate_sftp_connection Method:\nThis method calls the create_ssh_connection method to create the SSH connection and then proceeds to open the SFTP connection. On successful connection, it sets 'self.sftp_ok' to true. On failure, it sets 'self.sftp_ok' to false and returns.\n\nmove_files_to_processed Method:\nThis method is called in the initiate_ingestion method after the file is successfully uploaded to S3. It takes the file name as an argument, sets the source and destination paths on the FTP server ('src' and 'dest'), and executes the command to move the file from the source path to the destination path. If an exception occurs during the move, an error message is printed.\n\ncreate_s3_partition Method:\nThis method creates the S3 partition structure. The partition consists of a root directory name followed by year, month, day, and hour. This allows for time-based partitioned data.\n\ns3_upload_file_multipart Method:\nThis method uploads files to the specified S3 bucket. It uses the TransferConfig class to handle multipart uploads. We specify the configurations for TransferConfig, such as multipart threshold, chunk size, maximum concurrency, and use of threads. The multipart_threshold parameter determines the minimum size of a file that should be uploaded via multipart. AWS recommends uploading all files larger than 100MB via multipart. The multipart_chunksize parameter determines the size of each part during multipart upload. The max_concurrency parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent S3 API transfer operations to upload each part. Lastly, the use_threads parameter determines whether transfer operations use threads for concurrency. We pass this config object to 'self.s3.upload_fileobj' as a parameter.\n\ninitiate_ingestion Method:\nThis method initiates the calls to establish SSH and SFTP connections. It changes the FTP directory path to the specified path where the files reside, retrieves a list of all the files in that path, and starts uploading them to S3. Files successfully uploaded to S3 are moved to the processed directory on the FTP server. Once all files are uploaded, all connections are closed.\n\nclose_connections Method:\nThis method is used to close the SSH and SFTP connections.\n\nUsing the Code in AWS Glue:\nIf the user has files arriving on the FTP server at a certain time period (hour, day, month, etc.), they can schedule the job to run at a specific time to ingest all the files from the FTP server to S3. To use this implementation as an AWS Glue Python shell job, a few modifications need to be made. In the imports section of the 'python_glue_ingestion_job.py' file, uncomment the import related to the paramiko module. We are using easy_install to install the paramiko module in the Glue environment since it does not come with the default Python installation. Also, in the create_ssh_connection method, comment out the line 'self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.autoaddpolicy())' and uncomment the line 'self.ssh_client.load_system_host_keys()'. By doing these steps, the code can be run as a Python shell job in AWS Glue.\n\nSummary:\nIn this article, we discussed how to perform the data ingestion step of a data lake pipeline. We learned how to use the Paramiko library to create a secure SSH\/SFTP connection with an FTP server and upload files from the server to AWS S3 buckets. We also briefly looked at how to use this implementation in a managed environment such as AWS Glue.\n\nFor more details, please visit my GitHub repository [insert link here]. END"}
{"prompt":"i am always fascinated by all the wonderful things people can create . vaccines are one of those things . we have the ability to find ways to become immune to viruses without getting sick . but sometimes , people can really disappoint me . a survey conducted by the ap-norc center in may 2020 showed that 49% of americans plan to get vaccinated , 20% don’t , and 31% are unsure . image by apnorc . org old people are more willing to get vaccinated than young people . it partly surprised me , because old people tend to be more skeptical in general . but it’s also true that they are the ones who risk more lethal complications . white people are more will willing to get vaccinated than blacks or hispanics . i personally think that this has more to do with the economical status than with the race . minorities have a lower average income than whites in the us . they may be worried about the direct and indirect costs of vaccination . but it’s just my personal hypothesis . democrats are more willing to get vaccinated than republicans . it didn’t really surprise me . as a liberal , i know i can be biased , and i know that there are very smart conservatives too , so don’t take it personally . but the numbers speak for themselves here . also , i was a bit surprised that independents are the most unsure . maybe , since they are very moderate in their political views , they tend to be very moderate in everything ? not that it’s a bad thing . image by apnorc . org the reasons why one would get the vaccine are obvious . protecting oneself , one’s family , and the community are the most common ones . but i was really curious about the reasons one would not get the vaccine . image by apnorc . org all these reasons , except the allergy one , are very concerning . we will explore the top five in a moment . similar studies have been done everywhere . in europe , the situation isn’t much different . a similar poll has been conducted in italy , where i live , and it shows similar results . image by quotidianosanita . it it translates to “i am willing to get vaccinated if a vaccine against covid-19 will be identified” . the answers , left to right , are “absolutely unlikely” , “somewhat unlikely” , “neither unlikely nor likely” , “somewhat likely” , “very likely” . in the rest of this story , i will explore the reasons why people won’t get vaccinated , while also analyzing the psychology behind them . ignorance is as deadly as the virus photo by roman kraft on unsplash it’s not news that there is a lot of misinformation about vaccines . this is a major concern , to the point that the world health organization listed “vaccine hesitancy” as one of the 10 major global health threats . and it was in 2019 , before covid . without even talking about the made-up causality between vaccines and autism , which is a conspiracy theory held by a minority , there are other unfounded concerns held by a larger share of the population . let’s take another look at those shown by the poll “i would be concerned about side effects from the vaccine” . yes , vaccines have side effects and no vaccine is 100% safe . but these side effects are no worse or more frequent than any drug you normally take . a vaccine will be deployed only after it will be scientifically proven that the benefits outweigh the risks . “i would be concerned about getting infected with the coronavirus from the vaccine” . that’s the whole point ! you get infected so that you build immunity , but with a virus that is weakened and unable to reproduce . “i’m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus” . more on that later . “i don’t think vaccines work very well” . it’s true that most vaccines don’t have a 100% efficacy rate . a new vaccine is needed for influenza every year . but what do you have to lose ? even if the vaccine won’t work perfectly on you , it will probably still give you a partial immunity , and you would get less serious symptoms from an infection . “the coronavirus outbreak is not as serious as some people say it is” . are we still doing that ? coronavirus has already killed more than influenza normally does in a year without the lockdown . coronavirus may be just like a bad flu for some people , but it’s been proven that it’s way more contagious . it’s so disheartening that scientists are working hard on a vaccine to end this global crisis , but their efforts can be rendered worthless by mere human ignorance . people are getting bored with covid , it’s not frightening anymore photo by jade masri on unsplash after three months stuck at home , we got used to covid . now it’s part of our normal life , and we don’t care anymore . fear has diminished . most countries have eased the lockdown and expect people to behave with common sense , adopting good habits like wearing masks . but people won’t do something that is not mandatory if it’s even a bit uncomfortable . it’s too hot to wear masks now . who cares ? take blm protests , for example . i fully support the reasons behind these protests , but this was the worst timing possible . furthermore , allow me to get a bit off-topic and share an unpopular opinion . it’s not like they are going to fix anything . racism in the us is too deep-rooted in the nation’s history . slavery in the past created a vicious circle in which racism and low opportunities for blacks fed each other . even after they were granted equal rights , blacks got fewer chances to prove themselves and this further amplified racist views . protests may alleviate some symptoms , but it will take much more to fix racism . fortunately , though , studies show that these protests didn’t increase the spread of covid . so , why am i saying all this ? the point i want to make is how little people care about covid now . most people knew that these protests would have increased the spread , even if it didn’t happen . but they didn’t care . to make matters worse , most people have started to think that covid has gotten weaker with summer weather . this is not true . a virus never “gets weaker” on its own . it can only get stronger . it’s basic evolution . yes , the exponential spread has partially slowed down with the higher temperature . but this is only because , with hot weather , saliva drops evaporate faster , and the virus spreads with more difficulty . yet the virus itself is the same as before . after the summer , the spread will accelerate again , and we will likely get a second wave . if anything , the virus can only get more contagious with the summer , to adapt to a more difficult environment . but this is just my hypothesis , and i’m not a virologist , so i won’t make further predictions . this summer is the quiet before the storm . at least in europe , things look good for now . in italy , we are getting just 100–200 new cases every day . but in the us , with its government’s poor management , things look very , very bad . and people just don’t care anymore . your actions matter . remember , it all started with a single person photo by morning brew on unsplash one of the reasons why people wouldn’t get vaccinated was the following “i’m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus” . this is either ignorant or just selfish . as we are required to wear masks to protect others , we should get vaccinated not only to protect ourselves , but also to avoid being potential carriers of the virus . in other words , if you don’t get vaccinated , you may put several other people at risk . and it’s not just the 2–3 people you can directly infect . each of these people is another potential carrier that could infect another 2–3 people . this could grow exponentially and hundreds or thousands of people could get infected because you didn’t get vaccinated ( and neither did they ) . remember , it all started with a single person . as i’m writing this , there are almost 11 , 500 , 000 confirmed cases , while the actual number is probably 5 or 10 times higher . all it took was just one person . so , even if you don’t care about getting sick , you should get vaccinated for your friends , family , and community . it can actually make a difference . according to estimates , 50 to 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity . vaccination is an act of social responsibility . it’s not enough to fight fake news about vaccines , people should also be made aware of the importance of vaccination as a duty towards others . the virus itself is not the only challenge we are facing in this pandemic . the role of our opinions and decisions as responsible citizens poses a bigger challenge that will shape our future even beyond the pandemic .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I am consistently captivated by the remarkable creations that individuals can bring into existence. Vaccines are undoubtedly one of those incredible innovations. The ability to develop immunity to viruses without falling ill is truly remarkable. However, there are times when people's actions can be quite disappointing. In a survey conducted by the AP-NORC Center in May 2020, it was revealed that 49% of Americans plan to get vaccinated, 20% do not, and 31% remain unsure. This disparity in attitudes towards vaccination has raised some intriguing observations. \n\nOlder individuals are more willing to get vaccinated than their younger counterparts. While this may come as a surprise, considering that older individuals tend to be more skeptical in general, it is also crucial to recognize that they face a higher risk of severe complications from viruses. Additionally, white individuals appear to be more inclined to get vaccinated compared to Blacks or Hispanics. Personally, I believe this discrepancy may be more related to economic status than race, as minorities tend to have lower average incomes and may be concerned about the direct and indirect costs associated with vaccination. Nevertheless, this is merely my own hypothesis.\n\nInterestingly, the survey findings also indicate that Democrats express a greater willingness to get vaccinated compared to Republicans. While this correlation may not be surprising to some, it is important to acknowledge that political affiliations do not determine one's intelligence or capacity for critical thinking. These numbers merely serve as a reflection of the current situation. Moreover, I found it intriguing that independents exhibit the most uncertainty. It is possible that their moderate political views extend to other aspects of their lives as well. However, this moderation should not be perceived as negative.\n\nThe reasons for getting vaccinated are quite evident and include protecting oneself, one's family, and the community at large. However, I was particularly curious about the reasons behind the hesitation to get vaccinated. Among the cited reasons, excluding allergies, there are numerous concerns that warrant attention. Let us now delve into the top five reasons for this hesitation.\n\nIt is no secret that misinformation about vaccines is rampant. The World Health Organization even designated \"vaccine hesitancy\" as one of the ten major global health threats as early as 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some conspiracy theories, such as a nonexistent link between vaccines and autism, are propagated by a minority, a larger portion of the population holds unfounded concerns. For instance, some express worry about potential side effects from the vaccine. Although vaccines do carry some risks, these side effects are no more severe or frequent than those associated with any other medication. Vaccine deployment only occurs after rigorous scientific evaluation proves that the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nAnother concern expressed is the fear of contracting the coronavirus from the vaccine itself. It is crucial to understand that the purpose of vaccination is to enable the body to develop immunity to a virus by being exposed to it in a controlled manner. This helps the immune system recognize and combat the virus effectively. Vaccines introduce weakened or inactivated versions of the virus into the body, preventing full-blown infection while triggering a protective response.\n\nSome individuals deem themselves less susceptible to severe illness caused by the coronavirus. However, it is important to acknowledge that this perspective is misguided. I will explore this further shortly. Additionally, some believe that vaccines are not highly effective. While it is true that most vaccines do not have a 100% efficacy rate, even a partial immunity obtained through vaccination can significantly reduce the severity of symptoms in case of an infection.\n\nLastly, there are those who believe that the severity of the coronavirus outbreak has been exaggerated. Such a standpoint ignores the grim reality that coronavirus has already claimed more lives than influenza typically does in an entire year, even without stringent lockdown measures. Although coronavirus may resemble a severe flu for some, it has been scientifically proven to be significantly more contagious. It is disheartening to see that the tireless efforts of scientists working towards a vaccine to combat this global crisis can be undermined by the ignorance of individuals.\n\nAs studies have shown, people have grown weary of COVID-19. It has become a part of our everyday lives, and the fear surrounding it has diminished. Most countries have now relaxed lockdown measures, relying on common sense and the adoption of preventive measures, such as wearing masks. However, individuals tend to avoid actions that are not mandatory, even if they offer a marginal inconvenience. The belief that it is too hot to wear masks is a prime example of this mentality. Take, for instance, the Black Lives Matter protests. While I wholeheartedly support the reasons behind these protests, they occurred at an inopportune time. Furthermore, allow me to digress slightly and express an unpopular opinion: such protests will not single-handedly rectify the deeply ingrained racism within the United States. Centuries of racism have created a vicious circle in which systemic discrimination and limited opportunities feed into each other. Even after equal rights were granted, black individuals continued to face unequal treatment and limited opportunities, perpetuating racist viewpoints. While protests may alleviate some symptoms, much more must be done to truly eradicate racism. Fortunately, studies have indicated that these protests did not significantly contribute to the spread of COVID-19. So, why am I mentioning this? The crux of the matter is that people have become apathetic towards COVID-19 to an alarming extent. Many individuals, despite recognizing the potential for increased spread, simply do not care. Moreover, many have developed the misconception that COVID-19 has become milder due to the summer weather. It is essential to dispel this notion. Viruses do not spontaneously weaken over time; they can only evolve to become more potent. While higher temperatures may temporarily slow the exponential spread by aiding the faster evaporation of respiratory droplets, the virus itself remains unchanged. As we approach the end of summer, the rate of transmission is likely to resurge, potentially resulting in a second wave. It is important to note that this is purely my hypothesis, and I am not a virologist, thus I refrain from making further predictions. The current calm may simply be the lull before the storm. For now, Europe appears to be faring relatively well, with Italy, for example, experiencing only 100-200 new cases daily. However, the situation in the United States, hindered by inadequate governance, appears bleak. Unfortunately, people seem to be indifferent. \n\nIt is critical to recognize that our actions have a tangible impact. One of the reasons cited for not getting vaccinated is the lack of concern about the severity of illness caused by the coronavirus. This attitude reflects either ignorance or selfishness. Just as we wear masks to protect others, getting vaccinated is not only about safeguarding ourselves but also preventing the potential spread of the virus to vulnerable individuals. Simply put, by refusing vaccination, one can unwittingly put numerous others at risk. Furthermore, each person infected has the potential to infect another 2-3 individuals, leading to an exponential growth in cases. It is vital to remember that everything began with a single person. As I write this, there are nearly 11.5 million confirmed cases worldwide, with the actual number likely being significantly higher. All it took was a single person's introduction of the virus. Thus, even if one does not fear falling ill personally, getting vaccinated becomes an act of consideration towards loved ones, the community, and society at large. In fact, estimates suggest that achieving herd immunity would require 50 to 70% of the population to be vaccinated. Vaccination is a fundamental aspect of social responsibility. It is insufficient to merely combat fake news about vaccines; people must also be educated about the importance of vaccination as a duty towards others. In this pandemic, we face not only the challenge posed by the virus itself but also the role our opinions and decisions as responsible citizens play in shaping our future beyond the pandemic. END"}

Distractions abound, pulling us in different directions and hindering us from focusing on what truly matters. It has become all too common to go through our days, constantly busy but without any room for real thinking and reflection. Some might argue that in such a hectic life, setting aside dedicated time for thinking is a luxury we cannot afford.\n\nHowever, author Greg McKeown presents an alternative viewpoint in his New York Times best-selling book, Essentialism. McKeown suggests that as things become busier and faster, we actually need to build thinking time into our schedules. Moreover, in the midst of all the noise and distractions, it becomes even more crucial to create quiet spaces for reflection, where we can truly concentrate.\n\nDrawing inspiration from successful individuals, McKeown highlights the practices of leaders like Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn, and Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. Weiner schedules up to two hours of uninterrupted time on his calendar every day, a practice he adopted when back-to-back meetings threatened to take over his schedule. Initially, he felt that blocking out blank spaces was a self-indulgence, but he now credits it as his most valuable productivity tool. Similarly, Bezos keeps two days per week unstructured to allow for thinking, generating new ideas, and adopting a long-term perspective rather than getting lost in the day-to-day operations.\n\nBill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, also prioritizes thinking time. He regularly takes a week off twice a year solely for reading and reflection. This \"think week\" ritual has been maintained since the 1980s, even during the most challenging periods in business for both Microsoft and the Gates Foundation. As McKeown emphasizes, no matter how busy we think we are, we can always find time and space to think within our workday.\n\nFinding this time for thinking may involve carving out the first moments of the morning instead of immediately checking email or dedicating a portion of the afternoon to reflection instead of indulging in social media. Whether it's two hours per day, two days per week, or two weeks per year, it is crucial that we intentionally set aside time to think. This space is vital for prioritizing our lives and work, allowing us to focus our energy on what truly matters. To make it happen, we must consciously design it into our calendars. END"}

and what can startups in their infancy , but with facebook-scale ambitions , learn from turning internal dissent into an advantage for the organization ? how might dissent be an engine for positive civil impact as economic milestones are achieved ? the advantages of dissent given the incentives and rules of the shareholder economy , most companies today operate a bit like a constitutional monarchy , with a parliamentary function embodied by a board and shareholders , meant to keep executives ( the monarchs ) in check . oversight is meant to prevent abuses or harms that might affect the bottom line , or potentially generate negative legal repercussions . these tend to be cold and unfeeling calculations . there is no real oversight beyond this dynamic for moral hazard — we haven’t yet built that into how our economies operate . there are more cases than warrant cataloguing for greed overriding principle in the behavior of corporate leaders . in fact it’s common that csr and philanthropic initiatives operate to whitewash ill-gotten gains . if you want a fascinating at length exposé , consider anand giridharadas’ book winners take all the elite charade of changing the world . and if you believe as i do , that the majority of power in our world is currently operative in the corporate sphere , then you may also agree that we as a global culture have politically devolved . in the last 500 years , we’ve moved from feudalism to democracy to corporate feudalism as the dominant forms of power shaping our lives today . how might we bring more democratic principles into corporations ? some companies have experimented with structures such as holocracy , or what noam chomsky once referred to as “anarcho-syndicalist communities , ” typified by burning man . the hope here was to flatten hierarchies and create dynamic self-directed teams to produce products , solve problems and achieve deliverables , whether shipping shoes or building theme camps or art cars . once achieved , the team could dissolve and join new teams in a constantly evolving fashion that would render the traditional org chart obsolete and provide the intrinsic fulfillment of novel initiatives for all involved . these attempts were most famously piloted by zappos and its ceo tony hsieh . amongst the tech community and written about here in the ny times , these experiments are now mostly considered to be failures , not producing greater employee satisfaction or superior outcomes . but this was just one experiment . if we are going to evolve the ways companies function and perhaps infuse them with more democratic processes , we’ll need to experiment a lot more than this . there’s a near infinite number of possibilities for democratizing internal operations as well as public access to internal decision making and overall accountability . and we’ll need to look at how open dialogue can be turned to competitive advantage . less dramatic experiments with more egalitarian decision making and structure have been trialed at patagonia and at rei and other co-ops throughout the world . and the promised land may include some element of pixar , but with a more inventive governance structure . pixar famously enshrined psychological safety and creativity generating rituals into its company in robust ways that have proven resilient , even after it was acquired by disney . a great place to read about how this was done is in ed catmull’s recent book , creativity inc . . pixar broke down the slide towards rigidity , politics and career enough at least to ensure that the studio did not forever attempt to repeat its most profitable films and instead pushed for continuous reinvention and originality of storylines . dissent is architected into pixar’s daily operations . so how might we move away from monarchy and towards democratic principles ? how could such principles become an advantage for your startup ? and what does this have to do with constructive conflict ? what’s come to light for me recently is the promise of collective intelligence , collective and complementary veins of creativity and problem solving . these are ideas at the forefront of social science and most of them have not really been fully applied in the context of commercial companies . to fully benefit from complementary intelligence and talent you need to solicit the recurrent and safe voice of dissent . we need to think together . in the words of laurie mulvey , director of world in conversation , “conflict doesn’t have to be a dirty word . ” you need robust trust and real disagreement , without people succumbing to “amygdala hijack , ” a full blown attack of anger , because someone feels personally threatened . for trust to blossom and unvarnished dissent to surface consistently , using safi bahcall’s metaphor , a garden must be tended . larger work cultures tend to cultivate battlefields more than gardens . they teach insecurity , scarcity , avoidance of risk , minimal agency , a war mindset , a zero sum game , with commands trickling down from the top of a pyramidal org chart . the norm is to focus on politics and career advancement . at least in america , most employees can be laid off without notice . if you speak up and become a pain in the ass , the possibility of being fired and to some degree blacklisted in an industry is real . when you’re out there hiring , this sort of conditioning is brought into your startup by most employees , no matter what your company may screen for . it’s a reasonable expectation within the job marketplace as it is . people play defense and zip their lips . to remove the muzzles , golden or otherwise , and benefit from collective intelligence requires repetition from leadership . it requires the cultivation of a symbiotic garden wherein all elements flourish . leaders will need to repeat that substantive moral dissent is welcome , moral questioning is welcome , to produce this kind of candor . this requires emotionally secure and wise leaders . and though it may feel too dangerous , dissent that is visible outside of the company is not necessarily a disadvantage . a growing body of research suggests that leaders willing to express vulnerability and fallibility are far more sympathetic and credible . working with dissent and cultivating collective intelligence so in conclusion for you startup founders , how might your company benefit from the collective intelligence of your founding team ? and how might you build a culture and company with enshrined rituals to benefit from dissent , from diversity of opinions that will allow you to remain flexible and adaptive as context changes and your company’s impact grows ? here are a few suggestions . practice constructive conflict . model and repeat that the culture you’re all building together is not a monarchy , that collective wrestling with tactics and with moral issues implied by the company’s activity is welcome , always . schedule for amas and close the loop by telling your colleagues when their dissent or differing perspective shaped or reshaped any small or large part of the company’s operations . model and repeat that the culture you’re all building together is not a monarchy , that collective wrestling with tactics and with moral issues implied by the company’s activity is welcome , always . schedule for amas and close the loop by telling your colleagues when their dissent or differing perspective shaped or reshaped any small or large part of the company’s operations . be a good gardener , not a military general . devolve decision making to others as much as possible and repeat that you trust them , admire them and care deeply about their success . call attention to their greater expertise and defer to their decisions especially when you initially disagreed with their proposals . devolve decision making to others as much as possible and repeat that you trust them , admire them and care deeply about their success . call attention to their greater expertise and defer to their decisions especially when you initially disagreed with their proposals . do the dangerous and hard thing . develop a communications strategy that demonstrates to your customers and the public that you’re a fallible , humble , learning organization , not a uniform and obedient phalanx of soldiers gulping kool-aid without question . companies that treat their work like war are increasingly mistrusted . be relatable and human and watch public respect for what you accomplish rise . speak from integrity , follow through and own mistakes . develop a communications strategy that demonstrates to your customers and the public that you’re a fallible , humble , learning organization , not a uniform and obedient phalanx of soldiers gulping kool-aid without question . companies that treat their work like war are increasingly mistrusted . be relatable and human and watch public respect for what you accomplish rise . speak from integrity , follow through and own mistakes . remain wary of tying compensation to blind obedience . continuously realign extrinsic rewards with ethical behaviors , even whistleblowing . know what is happening when you’re not in the room and that it’s in service of the company’s ethical standards . remember that adam smith , arguably the father of economics , was actually a moral philosopher . continuously realign extrinsic rewards with ethical behaviors , even whistleblowing . know what is happening when you’re not in the room and that it’s in service of the company’s ethical standards . remember that adam smith , arguably the father of economics , was actually a moral philosopher . check in with employees with off the record one on one discussions . don’t just focus on tactical execution of goals , but an openness to explore and revisit the company’s raison d’être and how this does or doesn’t align with current products or services on offer . finally , a note on who gets to dissent . i think this is best addressed by hallowed pundit , author and syncretic thinker malcolm gladwell . in this short video from the bbc , he addresses social conditioning , ethnicity and bias in who is allowed to add friction and who is discouraged from doing so , all good things to be aware of if you truly want to encourage constructive dissent in your company from all voices and corners .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In 2019, former CIA agent Yael Eisenstat was specifically hired by Facebook to help reform how the company works with political disinformation and political ads that contain lies. However, Eisenstat quickly left the company, expressing outrage at Facebook's inability to take a sober look in the mirror. She has since become a vocal critic, believing that reforming Facebook is the best and most viable path forward.\n\nFacebook has grown to become a media empire, fending off numerous competitors and boasting an unassailable network effect, reaching over 2 billion people and counting. While it is a source of American pride and a projection of soft power, it has also proven to be an Achilles heel for American democracy. Facebook has been vulnerable to external actors like Russia and China, who have used the platform to fracture and divide us, sow discord and unrest, and diminish America's standing in the world. Some even argue that Facebook, along with other social media platforms to a lesser degree, has been a driver pushing America to the brink of a new civil war.\n\nAlthough Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg engages weekly with Facebook employees in \"Ask Me Anything\" sessions where dissent is ostensibly encouraged, the company did not alter its content policies until Zuckerberg's personal wealth took a hit due to an ad boycott. This suggests that money speaks louder than any other voice for Zuckerberg. Privately, many individuals in the technology industry and major news outlets are skeptical of the recent Facebook oversight board. Some view it as a pre-emptive attempt at self-regulation to avoid government oversight that could impose real sanctions for hate speech or lies with serious criminal or geopolitical impacts.\n\nIt would be commendable to have an oversight committee with real independence, that cannot be overruled by Zuckerberg on a whim and can make binding choices that prioritize greater civic responsibility over revenues. However, based on recent experience, it is unlikely that such choices would be approved by Zuckerberg. Substantive change will most likely come through legislation from Congress.\n\nAlthough some individuals have abandoned Facebook due to concerns about data harvesting and the control of information, there are still those who remain on the platform to connect with loved ones around the world. Users recognize that Facebook provides connection and opportunities, but they also acknowledge that the algorithm dictates what they see and read, and who sees and reads their posts. They feel they have minimal control over their \"bubble\" while Facebook adjusts it to fit their advertisers and maximize its own revenue.\n\nTo address the unchecked power of Facebook, digital data rights legislation, such as the one proposed by Andrew Yang's Humanity Forward organization, could be instrumental. If individuals were paid for their data and had the ability to collectively bargain for its use, Facebook's benefits could be retained without compromising civic responsibility. Ultimately, a self-sovereign digital identity, akin to the one we have in the physical world, may be necessary to ensure rights, protections, and responsibilities online.\n\nIf dissent had been genuinely valued at Facebook, it could have resulted in a more flexible approach to issues like limits on freedom of speech. Startups with Facebook-scale ambitions can learn from this and turn internal dissent into an advantage for the organization. Dissent can be an engine for positive civil impact as economic milestones are achieved.\n\nIn most companies today, the workplace operates like a constitutional monarchy, with a board and shareholders meant to keep executives in check. There is little oversight for moral hazards and too many cases of greed overriding principle. Bringing more democratic principles into corporations requires experimentation and a shift away from hierarchical structures. Companies like Patagonia and REI have experimented with more egalitarian decision-making models, while Pixar has successfully enshrined psychological safety and dissent into its operations.\n\nTo fully benefit from collective intelligence, it is important to create an environment where safe dissent is encouraged. Constructive conflict and robust trust are essential. Leaders must repeat that substantive moral dissent is welcome and cultivate a culture where all elements can flourish. Devolving decision-making, demonstrating vulnerability, and owning mistakes are also crucial. Tying compensation to blind obedience should be avoided, and leaders should continuously realign rewards with ethical behaviors.\n\nOpen dialogue and dissent visible outside the company should not be seen as a disadvantage. Leaders willing to express vulnerability and fallibility are often more sympathetic and credible. Regular check-ins and off-the-record discussions with employees can foster open exploration and ensure alignment with the company's ethical standards.\n\nIn conclusion, startup founders should consider how their companies can benefit from collective intelligence and dissent. Building a culture that welcomes constructive conflict and incorporating enshrined rituals can help maintain flexibility and adaptability. Suggestions include practicing constructive conflict, devolving decision-making, communicating humility and fallibility, aligning rewards with ethical behaviors, and valuing dissent from all voices and corners.

Computers can only process binary information, represented by 0s and 1s. This binary information encompasses not only text and video but also images. When attempting to understand how a computer comprehends an image, one can envision a matrix of the image's size, where each cell is assigned a value representing the color of the image at that specific location.\n\nLet's consider an example using a grayscale image. In this scenario, we can assign a numerical value, which can be interpreted as binary, to each block or pixel in the image. This numerical value can fall within any range, although it is customary to use 0 for black, 255 for white, and the integers in between to represent varying levels of intensity. When dealing with color images, the approach may vary slightly depending on the library and the chosen representation of colors. We will delve deeper into this topic later in the post. Nonetheless, the underlying principle remains the same across different methods: using distinct channels to represent colors, with RGB (red, green, and blue) being one of the most popular options. RGB necessitates the use of three channels to build each pixel. Consequently, our 2D matrix becomes a 3D matrix with a depth of 3, where each channel denotes the intensity of a specific color. By blending these channels, we obtain the final color for each pixel.\n\nWorking with images using OpenCV, let us proceed to the code for executing three essential functions: reading, displaying, and saving images.\n\n```\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Reading the image\nimage = cv2.imread('sample1.jpg')\n\n# Displaying the image\nplt.imshow(image)\nplt.show()\n\n# Saving the image\ncv2.imwrite('sample1_output.jpg', image)\n```\n\nIf you run the provided code, you will produce one image saved to disk and another displayed through the plot. The image on the left represents the plotted image, whereas the image on the right corresponds to the one saved on disk. Despite the size disparity due to the plot, the left image appears unusual, tinged with a bluish hue. So, why does it differ from the correct image on the right?\n\n(By the way, the image saved on the right is accurate.)\n\n[Image by Author, from original image by Berkay Gumustekin on Unsplash] END"}

one of the most popular blogs on the internet . of all the things he shared with me in our conversation , one thing he said stood out to me . i write 1000 words every day . shortly after that conversation i started writing 1000 words a day and it’s something i’ve been doing ever since . to say that the habit changed my life would be an understatement . it’s served as a form of meditation , therapy , and clarity . it led to a 2 book deal with a publisher and helped me to launch a career as an author and speaker it’s enabled me to finish a 45 , 000 word manuscript in 6 months and write 100’s of articles . this simple daily habit has literally had a six figure roi . it’s changed my life and my career . 1 . a habit born out of necessity what started first out of curiosity , eventually turned into something that i had to do out of necessity . the demands on my production increased dramatically almost overnight . i was writing 2–3 posts a week for my personal blog in addition to a weekly newsletter i was being paid $1000 a month to write one piece a week for a client i was writing a weekly piece for a blog at a startup that i owned a small equity stake in . in order to keep up with the demand , i had to develop a system . if i waited to be inspired i would be screwed as i’ve said before , systems are essential to increasing your creative output . 1000 words a day became my system . within a few months it was a habit so deeply ingrained into my life that it was like brushing my teeth . and that’s when things started to get really interesting . 2 . the art of being unmistakable as part of my 1000 words i would publish a really long facebook status update , what i jokingly referred to as committing career suicide one status update at a time . after a few months my writing started resonating with people like it never had before . in september of 2013 , i compiled all of my facebook status updates into a google doc , had it edited , had mars dorian design a book cover , uploaded it to amazon and called it the art of being unmistakable . the first week it sold 300 copies and i considered that a success . but about three weeks later , a media circus erupted . when i check the rankings on amazon , i noticed that my book was #1 in the entrepreneurship category . when i tweeted about it , somebody said “you might want to thank glenn beck . he raved about your book on his show today . ” when i asked a friend she said “i don’t think you realize how big a deal this is , check your sales . ” when i logged into the amazon dashboard , i noticed that the book had sold 1000 copies in a day . shortly after that i ended up being on the glenn beck show and my self published book became a wall street journal best seller . 3 . a 2-book deal with a publisher between 2013 and 2015 , i never stopped writing 1000 words a day . a few months into 2015 , i got the following email from an editor at penguin portfolio . i recently rejoined publishing after working at online education startups , having just left skillshare to join the penguin random house team . while it might seem counterintuitive , i came back just for this specific division that works and thinks differently than most of the industry — and is setting out to help entrepreneurs and changemakers with the stories , experiences , and motivation of people who have successfully forged their own path , people like seth godin , guy kawasaki , ryan holiday , nir eyal , nick bilton , and more . you are one of those people , and are top of my list of who to contact to work on a book together . writing in many ways is like planting seeds . you plant seeds today for the person you eventually want to become . after a few conversations , my daily writing habit resulted in a 2 book deal . the first book unmistakable why only is better than best was released on august 2 , 2016 . and i’m currently working on my second book . so how exactly do you incorporate this habit into your life ? 4 . design an environment conducive to writing you have to design an environment that’s conducive to the person you want to become . if you want to become a writer , your environment should reflect that . if you came to my apartment you would notice two things 1 ) i read a lot of books 2 ) i have stacks of moleskine notebooks it’s likely that you’d notice something similar in the environment of anybody else who is a writer . when i ate dinner at tucker max’s house for the first time , the first thing that caught my attention was the sheer number of books he had . in ryan holiday’s post about maintaining a physical library you’ll see that he has multiple bookshelves that are filled from floor to ceiling . 5 . activation energy and success accelerants in his book the happiness advantage , the author shawn achor talks about how reducing the amount of energy it takes to do something increases the likelihood you’ll do it . something as simple as decreasing the number of mouse clicks to do something will increase your odds of doing it . the simple hack for this is using a distraction free writing tool like macjournal . set it up the night before , so when you flip open your laptop in the morning , it’s the first thing you see . then you just write . if you prefer to write with a paper notebook , put it out with a pen the night before . the simple act of putting your notebook out the night before with a pen increases the likelihood that you’ll actually follow through on writing . another variation of this hack is to write one sentence the night before , ideally right before you go to sleep . write down somebody else’s words . suddenly the page appears less daunting . this is one of the many reasons i always read before i write . since your brain makes progress towards a goal based on how close it thinks it is towards that goal , starting with a quote allows you tap into the power of success accelerants . 6 . be prolific “all good writing begins with terrible first efforts” — anne lammot it’s likely your early writing efforts will be lousy . don’t be afraid to write a shitty first sentence . to this day only a small amount of what i produce on a daily basis is actually usable . but when you write 7000 words a week , you don’t need much to be useable . say you write 1000 words a week that are decent . that’s 52 , 000 words . that’s one book in a year . your cumulative output matters more than any individual writing day . if you want to become a better writer , start by becoming a prolific one . 7 . don’t judge your work it’s possible during the course of 90 minutes of writing that you’ll wander . this happens to me all the time . i’ll get 3–4 paragraphs into a train of thought and suddenly i’m writing stream of consciousness psychobabble . at this point your natural temptation will be to give up or give into a source of distraction . but if you can resist this temptation and just let the verbal vomit show up on the page , you’ll get back to a place of making sense . in that sense it’s a bit like meditation . you simply observe the wandering mind and return to focusing on your breath . 8 . make it a habit inspiration is an unreliable strategy for creative work . the muse is a fickle mistress and she tends to show up on her own schedule . you on the other hand have the option to show up every day . by showing up every day , you tap into the profound power of consistency . something that starts as an item on your to do list eventually becomes a habit and you start to build momentum . on a related note- if you struggle with habits , i’ve put a guide together on optimizing productivity & creativity . sign up for my newsletter here and you’ll receive it shortly . 9 . always carry a notebook inspiration has a funny way of striking at unusual times . usually you’re not in front of the computer when this happens . a habit i picked up from my friend aj leon is to always carry a notebook . a notebook is like fertile soil where you can plant seeds for your creative ideas . 10 . learn to recognize patterns if you pay attention to how you work , you’ll start to see patterns . these patterns are incredibly useful in helping you to develop systems and mental models for you to get your work done . they give you a personal operating manual for yourself . recognizing patterns helps you adjust your behavior to reach optimal levels of performance . a pattern i saw in my life was that waking up before 6am and meditating led to deeper levels of flow and focus . i also knew that after 10am things seemed to go downhill and after 1pm i’m essentially worthless . i tend to experience flow most consistently when i give myself 90 minutes of uninterrupted creation time . if i go more than a few days without sweating or exercising , my depression and anxiety tend to be exacerbated . i saw that text messages that weren’t responded to after i sent a text were causing me anxiety . i turned of all notifications after this . these patterns play themselves out throughout our lives . not just in our work . they occur in nearly every situation . you might notice something as simple as a phrase in an email that always elicits a positive response . if that’s the case it makes no sense to deviate from that pattern . you might think that adjusting to patterns might make your life repetitive and boring , but the opposite seems to be true . the beauty of recognizing patterns in your life is that it frees up your cognitive bandwidth for much higher value activities than trying to decide how you plan to behave for the day . recognizing patterns in your life requires you to take actually take time , slow down and reflect on the results that your behavior is producing . understanding your own behavioral patterns and the results they produce is the closest thing to a “success” pill you could find . if x causes y , then it would make sense that you choose the x that causes the y that you want . as you recognize patterns you’ll begin not only work more efficiently but work more effectively . by utilizing the patterns you recognize to develop processes and systems , you free your mind up to think creatively . if your mind is taxed with decisions like how long and how much you’re depleting your willpower . one of the most valuable sections of the bestself journal is lessons learned for the day . we learn tons of lessons every day , but without the discipline to capture them , it’s no better than if we didn’t learn them at all . in fact this idea of patterns was inspired by a lesson i learned yesterday which was that 90 minutes of deep work was my consistent sweet spot . once i saw that pattern i started looking for other ones . as you recognize patterns in your life , you’ll go from a frenetic scatterbrained pace to one that is fast paced , focused , sustainable and generates momentum . there’s a point at which any habit you adopt eventually becomes a part of who you are . you no longer have to think about it . it’s what james clear refers to as an identity based habit if you see in me in a coffeeshop , at a conference , or anywhere else before 8am , it’s more than likely you’ll find me writing 1000 words . this is no longer something i just do . it’s who i am . in order for a habit to truly change your life , it has to become a practice , likely one that is lifelong .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I have written at least a thousand words a day since the age of twelve, as mentioned by Ray Bradbury in Zen and the Art of Writing. When I first interviewed Julien Smith in 2012, he had one of the most popular blogs on the internet. Among the many things we discussed, one thing that stood out was his practice of writing 1000 words every day. Inspired by our conversation, I started implementing this daily habit and it has had a profound impact on my life.\n\nWriting 1000 words a day has become a form of meditation, therapy, and a source of clarity for me. It not only led to a 2-book deal with a publisher, but also helped me launch a successful career as an author and speaker. This simple daily habit has allowed me to finish a 45,000-word manuscript in just 6 months and write hundreds of articles. Needless to say, it has had a significant return on investment, both financially and personally.\n\nThis habit was initially born out of necessity. The demands on my writing production increased rapidly, with various blog posts, newsletters, and freelance assignments to complete. In order to keep up with the demand, I had to develop a system. Relying on inspiration alone was not feasible. As I have mentioned before, having systems in place is crucial to increasing creative output. Thus, writing 1000 words a day became my system. Within a few months, it became such an ingrained habit that it felt as natural as brushing my teeth.\n\nAs part of my daily word count, I started publishing lengthy Facebook status updates, jokingly referring to it as committing career suicide one post at a time. Surprisingly, this approach resonated with readers like never before. In September 2013, I compiled these Facebook updates into a book called \"The Art of Being Unmistakable.\" To my surprise, it sold 300 copies in the first week. However, three weeks later, it gained significant popularity after being mentioned on the Glenn Beck show. It sold 1000 copies in a day and eventually became a Wall Street Journal best seller.\n\nMy commitment to writing 1000 words a day never wavered between 2013 and 2015. In early 2015, an editor from Penguin Portfolio approached me with a book deal. Recognizing the power of consistency, and after several conversations, I signed a 2-book deal. The first book, titled \"Unmistakable: Why Only is Better than Best,\" was released on August 2, 2016, and I am currently working on my second book.\n\nTo incorporate this habit into your life, it is crucial to design an environment conducive to writing. For example, my apartment is filled with books and stacks of Moleskine notebooks. Similarly, other writers often have a similar environment that reflects their profession. By surrounding ourselves with the tools and atmosphere that resonate with our goals, we increase the likelihood of success.\n\nReducing the activation energy required to write is crucial in fostering success. Simple hacks like using a distraction-free writing tool or placing a notebook and pen within reach the night before can significantly increase productivity. By minimizing the number of obstacles in our way, we increase our chances of following through with our writing commitments.\n\nIt is important to accept that not all our writing will be perfect. Embracing the concept of being prolific allows us to overcome the fear of producing subpar work. By writing consistently, even if only a small portion of it is good, we can still accumulate a significant body of work over time. A weekly output of 1000 words can add up to 52,000 words in a year, which is enough material for a book.\n\nWe must resist the urge to judge our work as we write. It is natural for our thoughts to wander and for our writing to become scattered or unfocused. However, if we persist and allow our thoughts to flow freely without judgment, we can find our way back to clarity. This process is similar to meditation, where we observe our wandering thoughts and return to our breath. By embracing this approach, we can navigate through the creative process with more ease.\n\nMaking writing a habit is crucial. Relying on inspiration alone is unreliable and impractical. By showing up every day to write, we tap into the power of consistency. This practice builds momentum over time and fosters profound personal growth. To learn more about optimizing productivity and creativity, I have created a guide that can be accessed by signing up for my newsletter.\n\nAlways carrying a notebook is a valuable habit. Inspiration often strikes when we least expect it, and it is important to be prepared to capture those creative ideas. A notebook provides a fertile ground for planting and nurturing these ideas.\n\nRecognizing patterns in our work habits and behaviors is essential. By paying attention to how we work, we can identify patterns that help us develop effective systems. These systems allow us to work more efficiently and optimize our performance. Recognizing patterns also frees up mental energy, as we no longer have to make decision after decision about how to behave each day.\n\nAdopting a habit requires consistency and commitment. To truly change our lives, habits must become lifelong practices that shape our identity. For me, writing 1000 words every morning has become an integral part of who I am. It is no longer just something I do; it is a fundamental aspect of my existence.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating the habit of writing 1000 words a day can have a transformative effect on your life and career. It serves as a form of meditation, therapy, and a catalyst for personal and professional growth. By designing an environment conducive to writing, reducing activation energy, and embracing a prolific mindset, you can develop a consistent writing practice that leads to remarkable outcomes. END"}
{"prompt":"infection | brain anorexia has a bacterial origin , researchers say it’s too naive to think anorexia arises from psychosocial factors alone , researchers argue . image by coxinhafotos from pixabay sitting at the 3rd most common disease affecting adolescent females , anorexia is characterized by severe calorie restriction — comorbid with anxiety and depression — that lead to the starvation and malfunctioning of many other organs . anorexia is titled the most fatal mental illness . anorexia etiology revisited “psychological factors might be important but are unconvincing as the primary or major cause [of anorexia] , ” james morris and colleague from lancaster university , uk , wrote in medical hypothesis in 2016 . anorexia is a functional or psychosomatic disease psycho means mind and somatic means body . it’s a mind-body disease caused by a combination of psychological and physical factors . modern views of anorexia , however , neglect the physical cause of the disease , as morris and team argued there might , for instance , be an increased incidence of physical and sexual abuse in childhood in those who go on to manifest functional disorders . it is easy to see how this could influence symptoms in adults but it stretches credulity to imagine abuse as the sole and sufficient cause of the functional disorder . equally modern concepts of the perfect physical form promoted by the fashion industry will influence teenagers to diet but surely there must be something more profound and fundamental to induce emaciation and death by starvation or suicide . basically , morris et al . question the idea of psychosocial factors being the sole cause of anorexia . it’s too simplistic and crédule , they thought . it doesn’t explain why a subset of adolescents do not develop anorexia when they have been exposed to similar childhood and cultural experiences . many will quickly attribute this to differences in genetics , social support or individual’s innate resilience . while these may also contribute to the overall likelihood of developing anorexia , morris et al . asked what if bacteria also play a role ? when bacteria-fighting antibodies attack the brain morris et al . first observed that anorexia nervosa is 10x more prevalent in females than males , and so are autoimmune diseases . they then cited several studies that found the presence of autoantibodies — that attack the serotonin neurons and appetite-regulating hormones\/peptides— roaming in the blood and hypothalamus of anorexics . the levels of these autoantibodies also correlated with the severity of the eating disorder . the hypothalamus is a brain region that controls human ' s basic needs such as sleep , body temperature , thirst , and appetite . it’s also part of the limbic system — also called the reptilian brain — which is an ancient set of structures in the brain that governs instincts and emotions . where did these auto-antibodies come from ? the studies that discovered them raised the possibility of bacterial infection ( s ) . upon encountering foreign entities , the immune system makes antibodies that bind to the bacteria surface — to neutralize or marked it for destruction by other immune cells . if the bacterium shares a similar structure to some of the host’s proteins — a phenomenon called molecular mimicry — the antibodies will target both the bacteria and the host own proteins . the fact that these antibodies — now autoantibodies — are considered as allies makes things worse . the blood-brain-barrier , for example , doesn’t see it as a threat — enabling these autoantibodies to easily enter the brain’s limbic system . “auto-antibodies acting on the [brain’s] limbic system could induce extremes of emotion including disgust and fear , ” morris et al . wrote . “these then become linked , in the minds of adolescent girls , to culturally determined ideas of what is , and what is not , the ideal body shape and size . it is then a small step for disgust and fear to be directed to food and obesity which the fashion industry currently demonises . ” linking to gut dysbiosis while morris et al . have not pinpointed a specific bacterial agent , current scientific evidence suggests that it could be gut bacteria . sergueï fetissov , md and professor of physiology , and colleagues from rouen university and hospital in france published a pioneer finding in this regard — which morris et al . cited in his medical hypothesis paper . fetissov and team found that autoantibodies — attacking appetite-regulating peptides — in the bloodstream of anorexics have substantial sequence similarities to few known gut microbes and external pathogens . proteins having a similar string of amino acid sequence likely have similar structures . and similar structures indicate a higher chance of getting bound by the same antibody due to molecular mimicry . “numerous cases of sequence homology with these [appetite-regulating] peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including lactobacilli , bacteroides , helicobacter pylori , escherichia coli , and candida species , ” the authors wrote . these are just some examples as they have also discovered 20 other such microbes that have similar protein sequences as the human appetite-regulating peptides . the team further showed that mice without a gut microbiome have lower levels of such autoantibodies than normal mice . “our data demonstrate multiple cases of molecular mimicry of regulatory peptides with microbial proteins , identifying micro-organisms as putative biological targets to be tested for their relevance to the normal or pathophysiologic mechanisms of appetite and emotion , ” fetissov et al . continued . linking to the gut-brain axis a 2019 review — written by jochen seitz , md , and coordinator of eating disorders research at university aachen and colleagues from germany — took a more holistic approach to the bacterial implications of anorexia . they look at the gut-brain axis and its associated immunology as a whole . they look at it as intricate biological machinery or systems that interact with one another ( see figure below ) . while providing evidence supporting that bacterial infection may confuse the immune system to make antibodies attacking the brain’s appetite-regulatory signals , they added more recent evidence on the gut microbiome profile of anorexics . compared to non-anorexics , their gut showed a reduced microbial diversity and abnormal outgrowth of certain microbes . “these digestive products of [microbial] protein fermentation [in anorexics] were previously found to increase pyy-production , a gastric peptide known to decrease appetite and increase depressive symptoms , ” the german researchers wrote . image credit open-access publication . caption gut microbiome interactions in patients with an . citation seitz et al .

( 2019 ) proposed for gut microbiome interventions in addition to traditional therapy for anorexia . “the goals could be to increase the amount of energy harvested from the same quantity of food and to decrease gut permeability , inflammation and antibody formation , with the potential consequence of reducing depressive and anxious symptoms , ” seitz and colleagues emphasized . likewise , andrew radford , the chief executive of beat , an eating disorder charity told the telegraph\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Infection: Brain Anorexia Linked to Bacterial Origin, Researchers Say\n\nAnorexia, the third most common disease affecting adolescent females, is characterized by severe calorie restriction, often accompanied by anxiety and depression, leading to starvation and malfunctioning of multiple organs. While psychological factors have been considered important in the development of anorexia, researchers from Lancaster University argue that attributing it solely to psychosocial factors is too simplistic.\n\nAnorexia is a complex disease that involves both psychological and physical factors. However, current views tend to overlook the physical cause of the disease. The researchers argue that while factors such as childhood abuse or societal pressure to attain a certain physical appearance may influence the development of anorexia, there must be more profound and fundamental factors that contribute to the extreme weight loss and potential life-threatening consequences.\n\nJames Morris and his team question the idea that psychosocial factors alone can explain the development of anorexia. They argue that it doesn't account for why some individuals with similar experiences and backgrounds do not develop the disorder. While genetics, social support, and innate resilience may contribute to the overall likelihood of developing anorexia, the researchers propose that bacterial infection may also play a role.\n\nThe researchers observed that anorexia nervosa is ten times more prevalent in females than males, similar to autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, they found the presence of autoimmune antibodies that attack serotonin neurons and appetite-regulating hormones in the blood and hypothalamus of anorexic individuals. These autoantibodies were also correlated with the severity of the eating disorder. The hypothalamus, a brain region that controls basic needs such as sleep, body temperature, thirst, and appetite, could be targeted by these autoantibodies.\n\nThe researchers suggest that these autoantibodies, which were initially created to fight bacteria, may mistakenly attack the host's own proteins due to a phenomenon called molecular mimicry. This allows them to enter the brain's limbic system, which governs instincts and emotions. The connection between disgust and fear with culturally determined ideas of the ideal body shape and size may then lead to extreme weight loss and a distorted perception of food.\n\nWhile the researchers have not identified a specific bacterial agent, they propose that gut bacteria could play a role in the development of anorexia. Other studies have shown similarities between the autoantibodies attacking appetite-regulating peptides in anorexic individuals and proteins found in gut microbes and external pathogens. The researchers further demonstrated that mice without a gut microbiome had lower levels of these autoantibodies.\n\nA holistic approach to understanding anorexia and its bacterial implications involves considering the gut-brain axis and its associated immunology. Research suggests that bacterial infection may disrupt the immune system, leading to the production of autoantibodies that attack the brain's appetite-regulatory signals. Anorexic individuals have been found to have reduced microbial diversity and abnormal growth of specific microbes in their gut.\n\nIn conclusion, an imbalance in the gut microbiome or dysregulated gut-brain axis can lead to systemic inflammation, the production of autoantibodies, and harmful microbial metabolites, all of which negatively affect the brain's appetite signals. This, in turn, may contribute to the development of anorexia, in addition to genetic and psychosocial factors. Therefore, interventions targeting the gut microbiome alongside traditional therapy could potentially improve outcomes for individuals with anorexia. END"}

This interstellar vessel, known as the \"Lunar Dawn,\" stands as a testament to the cutting-edge technology of its time, featuring an array of advanced capabilities that push the boundaries of human ingenuity.\n\nThe Lunar Dawn is equipped with a revolutionary propulsion system, powered by a combination of antimatter and fusion reactors. This advanced technology enables the starship to achieve speeds that were once thought impossible, propelling them through the vastness of space with unprecedented efficiency.\n\nThe departure of the Lunar Dawn from Earth is not born out of mere curiosity or exploration. Instead, it is driven by the necessity to find a new home for humanity. Earth, plagued by overpopulation and dwindling resources, has become an unsustainable habitat. The starship carries with it the hopes and dreams of a desperate population, entrusted with the mission to seek out a habitable planet that can ensure the survival of the human race.\n\nAs our story unfolds, the crew faces a myriad of obstacles and challenges along their journey. Each member of the diverse team has their own unique background and motivations. From engineers to scientists, soldiers to diplomats, each person contributes their own expertise to the mission. However, hidden beneath their façades, they harbor their own personal pains, haunted by past mistakes and failures. Trust and cooperation become crucial factors, as hidden agendas and personality clashes threaten to undermine the success of their mission.\n\nWhile the adversaries and enemies they encounter remain a mystery, one thing is certain: they possess a malevolent intent. Their plans, shrouded in darkness, pose a significant threat to the crew and their mission. Tensions and conflicts arise as the crew strives to uncover the true nature of their adversaries while simultaneously grappling with internal conflicts of their own.\n\nThroughout their journey, the crew faces moments of doubt, their resolve tested as they confront the darkness within themselves and the challenges before them. However, it is through these trials that they discover hidden strengths, talents, and resilience that allow them to transcend both the obstacles they face and their own limitations.\n\nAmidst the conflicts and trust issues that arise among the crew, they are forced to confront their differences and find ways to resolve their disputes. It is through understanding, empathy, and a shared commitment to the mission that they ultimately overcome these obstacles and find solutions to the problems they encounter.\n\nThe story crescendos with several cliffhangers that leave audiences yearning for more. Perhaps a crew member is captured by the enemy, or a crucial component of the starship malfunctions at a critical juncture. The finale, however, delivers a satisfying conclusion, as the crew, through unity and sacrifice, manages to overcome overwhelming odds and fulfills their mission of finding a new home for humanity.\n\nThrough this exercise in worldbuilding, screenwriting, and storytelling, we have embarked on a journey to envision a future filled with technological marvels, personal struggles, and heroic endeavors.

Waiting for the perfect mindset to produce content will only result in stagnation. While some may argue against the idea of forcing the creative process, I firmly believe that pushing through mental barriers is necessary to achieve productivity.\n\nIn my personal experience, I have discovered that writing serves multiple purposes for me. Firstly, it provides a source of income, which can contribute to my therapy sessions. Additionally, I aim to create content that may assist others in overcoming challenging situations related to mental health. Furthermore, I write about topics such as blogging, entrepreneurship, family, travel, and self-improvement, drawing from my own experiences and knowledge.\n\nOne of the reasons why I may not have achieved tremendous success on platforms like Medium is because I have often centered my writing around personal experiences rather than focusing on what my audience desires. Presenting content that is centered solely around oneself tends to be less appealing than providing valuable insights or actionable advice. I have recognized the significance of writing with my audience in mind, increasing their engagement and interest.\n\nAlthough monetization ranks as my primary motivation for blogging, I cannot compromise my integrity by exclusively writing clickbait headlines or crafting mediocre content. It is essential for me to stay true to my voice and beliefs, even if it means facing challenges in terms of generating consistent ideas or pushing myself to write.\n\nAmidst the cacophony of negative thoughts and self-criticism that often plague my mind, I find solace in my inner voice, my muse. This internal narrator helps me interpret and express my life experiences through writing. While my muse may be worn down by the constant noise and negativity, I understand the importance of fostering resilience within myself. Firmly, yet compassionately, I urge my muse to continue creating, knowing that waiting for inspiration or the perfect mood is futile and will hinder personal and professional growth.\n\nSometimes, I have to crack the whip, metaphorically speaking, to keep my muse awake and focused. It may be tempting for my muse to seek comfort and only write when inspiration strikes, but I know that succumbing to such a mindset will hinder progress. I recognize that the journey to success requires discipline, determination, and perseverance, even when the going gets tough.\n\nIn return for my muse's dedication, I promise him respite - a well-deserved vacation where he can indulge in snowy landscapes, fine wines, and delectable cuisine. This serves as a reminder that his hard work is appreciated and that there are rewarding experiences awaiting him as a result of his diligence.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that waiting for the perfect mood or inspiration is an impediment to productivity. By overcoming mental barriers, fostering discipline, and urging my muse to persist, I can continue to create meaningful content that resonates with my audience and contributes to my personal and professional growth.

With a mere six seconds remaining on the clock and Boston College trailing by four points, Flute resorted to a desperate act of throwing the ball, hoping that one of his receivers would make a clean catch or at least tip the ball in their favor. While this analogy may not perfectly reflect our current climate predicament, the concept of a Hail Mary play resonates with the American audience.\n\nAs a society, we face a limited set of options moving forward in the context of climate change. The first option is to do nothing, akin to Flute taking a knee without even attempting to advance the ball. The second option involves exclusively investing in climate adaptation, essentially giving up on addressing climate change while graciously accepting the challenges it poses. This approach can be compared to Flute calling a run play in the closing seconds of the game, acknowledging the loss but valiantly finishing the match.\n\nHowever, the most exciting and bold option is to throw our own Hail Mary—the Green New Deal. This ambitious initiative entails a series of federally funded programs of substantial scale, designed to drive our carbon emissions to net-zero. Undoubtedly, the phrase \"massive federally funded programs\" stirs political debate, with progressives and liberals celebrating these initiatives while fiscal conservatives fear increased taxes, debt, spending, and government involvement. Nevertheless, the uncomfortable reality of climate change demands attention, resources, and commitment from us and future generations. Preserving our planet comes at a considerable cost.\n\nWhile individuals, local and state governments, corporations, and non-governmental organizations have important roles to play, the urgency of the situation necessitates significant federal involvement. When referring to Green New Deal programs, we should no longer think of them as a single piece of legislation championed by a particular congresswoman. Instead, these programs must be viewed as a multitude of initiatives that will persist until we achieve a net-zero emission economy. Over the next three to five decades, countless programs and initiatives will be developed to address climate change and reduce our carbon footprint. Even after reaching a net-zero carbon footprint economy, we must sustain it, requiring ongoing efforts and the creation of new initiatives dedicated to upholding the promise of a sustainable future.\n\nConsidering the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in the United States, it is time for Americans to rally behind a Green New Deal—permanently. The political pendulum in the country may continue to swing back and forth, implying that in four to eight years, a fiscally conservative administration might prioritize climate change. If such a scenario is likely, it becomes even more crucial to support substantial investments in Green New Deal programs now. Imagine spending significant time and resources over several years on incremental legislation and modest emission reductions, only to shift to a congress under fiscal conservative control in 2028, having achieved minimal progress. Climate change realism refutes the viability of fiscal conservatism. If there exists a possibility of future fiscally conservative administrations, it lies upon this current congress and administration to render the future congresses and administrations irrelevant in the fight against climate change. We can no longer afford the luxury of oscillating back and forth. Our planet cannot endure the long-term consequences of the American political pendulum continuously swaying in favor of and against effective climate action.\n\nThis new congress and administration must make the pursuit of a sustainable future a permanent endeavor, detached from the trials of politics. What we require is a Hail Mary play, not necessarily to secure victory but to remain resolute in the battle against climate change. We need this Hail Mary play to last for generations, demanding redundancy. Just as Doug Flute sent three receivers down the field, we must develop and implement hundreds of programs and initiatives to tackle climate change, launching them into the future with sustained and ample funding.

It is important to acknowledge that no individual can constantly suppress panic and strong emotions without eventually experiencing physical or psychological repercussions. In a recent interview with various founders, they shared valuable insights that aided in their personal growth and resilience during challenging periods. Here are some key learnings:\n\n1. Seeking Help: Asking for assistance can be one of the most challenging tasks for a founder. Often, individuals strive to resolve all issues independently, fearing that revealing weaknesses may undermine their credibility. However, engaging in conversations with the right people to address these problems can help us gain new perspectives and overcome obstacles more quickly. Seeking help should be seen as a means to resolve issues efficiently, recognizing that time is of the essence in the startup world.\n\n2. Finding Emotional Support: The absence of emotional support is a common reason why founders may prematurely abandon their ventures. Having a supportive community of like-minded entrepreneurs has often been instrumental in revitalizing motivation. It is essential to realize that facing difficult times is a natural part of every startup journey, and one is not alone in experiencing these challenges. Moreover, the interviewees highlighted the presence of a trusted confidant—a friend, spouse, family member, mentor, or coach—who provided the necessary emotional safety net and guidance to navigate complicated situations and emotions. Cultivating such relationships is invaluable.\n\n3. Building a Family: Interestingly, one unexpected finding from the interviews was that many founders credited their family and children as an essential factor in their startup success. Building a startup often entails long nights at the office, and there is a prevailing belief that founders who do not commit exorbitant hours are not serious about their venture's success. However, having a family serves as a grounding force, reminding founders of what truly matters in life. As a result, this perspective helps founders manage their mental well-being and make informed decisions for their startups. Time spent with family also encourages better daily structuring. Additionally, families can provide much-needed emotional and even financial support during challenging times, preventing individuals from spiraling into negative thoughts and emotions. By expressing frustrations and receiving understanding and support, founders maintain a healthy balance.\n\nIn conclusion, the interviewed founders emphasized the significance of seeking help, finding emotional support, and prioritizing family in their journey as successful entrepreneurs. These lessons enabled them to overcome hardships and maintain mental resilience. END"}

It seems that this empty feeling of nausea stems from the toll that depression has taken on my mind. I don't consume alcohol, but I often refer to this as a vulnerability hangover, given the intense three-day period of despair that I experienced. Each day seemed to bring new levels of distress.\n\nDuring this time, I spent prolonged hours staring at the Dutch suicide prevention website, contemplating whether to engage in a chat conversation for support. However, I soon realized that if I couldn't put my distress into coherent words during an in-person conversation or in writing, it would be challenging to articulate my feelings through chat as well. Additionally, the availability of trains as an alternative escape route is scarce, making lying down on the tracks not a viable option. Furthermore, I've already eliminated the option of relying on medication, which I could have considered weeks ago. Although I may not have been entirely rational at the time, I knew that ingesting a large quantity of medication would have incapacitated me or worse. Recognizing the importance of removing that temptation, I promptly disposed of the remaining medication to ensure it was no longer accessible. Despite not feeling presentable, I took out the trash, knowing that once the container swallowed the bag, there would be no way to retrieve it.\n\nBetween the years 2013 and 2018, my mind relentlessly battled against me, continually pushing me towards self-destruction. However, for the past two years, I have dedicated my efforts towards teaching my mind to no longer harbor those thoughts of harm. END"}

With federated querying, users can submit a single SQL query that scans data from multiple sources, whether they are hosted on-premises or in the cloud. Athena accomplishes federated queries by utilizing Athena data source connectors, which are executed on AWS Lambda. The federated query feature for Athena is currently available in preview mode exclusively in the US East-1 (N. Virginia) region.\n\nTo prepare for creating federated queries, you must go through a two-step process:\n\n1. Deploying a Lambda function data source connector.\n2. Connecting the Lambda function to a data source.\n\nFor this process, it is assumed that you already have at least one DynamoDB table in the US East-1 region.\n\nTo deploy a data source connector, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Amazon Athena console and select the \"Connect data source\" option. Please note that this feature is only available in the US East-1 region.\n2. On the \"Connect data source\" console, select the \"Query a data source\" feature, and choose Amazon DynamoDB as your data source.\n3. Proceed to the next step and choose to configure a new function. This will open the Lambda console in a new tab, providing information about the connector.\n4. In the \"Application settings\" section, provide the necessary information, including:\n   - Athena catalog name: A name for the Lambda function.\n - Spill bucket: An Amazon S3 bucket in your account to store data that exceeds the Lambda function's response size limits.\n - Spill prefix: Data that exceeds the Lambda function's response size limits will be stored under the \"spill bucket\/spill prefix\" location.\n5. Acknowledge that the app creates custom IAM roles and then select \"Deploy\".\n\nTo connect to a data source using the deployed connector, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Amazon Athena console and select the \"Connect data source\" option. Remember that this is only available in the US East-1 region.\n2. On the \"Connect data source\" console, select the \"Query a data source\" feature, and choose Amazon DynamoDB as your data source. Proceed to the next step.\n3. Configure the Lambda function by selecting the name of the Lambda function you previously created. Configure the catalog name by entering a unique name for the data source in your SQL queries, such as \"dynamo_Athena\". Select \"Connect\".\n4. The data source will now be available under the \"Data sources\" section in Amazon Athena.\n\nTo query data using federated queries:\n\nTo utilize this preview feature, you must create an Athena workgroup called \"amazonathenapreviewfunctionality\" and join that workgroup.\n\nTo create an Athena workgroup:\n\n1. Open the Amazon Athena console and select \"Workgroup\". Choose \"Create workgroup\".\n2. After creating the workgroup, select the newly created workgroup from the \"Workgroup\" section and choose \"Switch workgroup\".\n3. Select the data source created earlier in Athena. The DynamoDB tables will now be accessible in Athena under the default database.\n\nTo query data in Athena using SQL queries:\n\nThe following query can be used to retrieve data from DynamoDB in Athena:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM data_source_connector.database_name.table_name\n```\n\nCreating an Athena table using CTAs with results from querying DynamoDB:\n\nThe CTAs (Create Table As Select) query format can be utilized to transform the data format into your desired format, such as Parquet, JSON, CSV, etc. Here is an example of a CTAs query:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE database.table_name\nWITH (    external_location = 's3:\/\/bucket-name\/data\/',\n    format = 'parquet')\nAS\nSELECT * FROM data_source_connector.database_name.table_name\n```\n\nWe hope this information is helpful to you.

{"prompt":"solitude has a stigma . our society harshly judges a solo life in any capacity — from the simple decisions of attending a movie alone to the major life choices of not getting married . when we see people alone , we may think they are antisocial , defective , or even criminal in nature . this toxic judgement prevents us from deepening our relationship with ourselves and our brains . without a sense of conviction in our solitude , we cannot be fully at peace with ourselves and our place in the world . it is only with a deeper sense of freedom in our solitary experiences that our relationships , goals , and health can fully blossom . jamila woods moves towards this solitude on “holy” , the penultimate track off her outstanding debut album heavn , an angelic and stirring standout that highlights the human capacity to thrive within oneself . “holy” by jamila woods before leading fans to inspiration , jamila woods blew away audiences everywhere by shining the light on her own ability to thrive . with immense lyrical depth and outstanding vocal performance , jamila stole the show on 2015’s surf , the debut album from the social experiment . on lead single “sunday candy” , she shocked and awed audiences with her angelic , tender , and rich voice , buoyed by lyrical content of spirituality and peace . on this gospel-infuenced hip-hop track , she delivered a chorus that could make the clouds part and the sun shine down even on the darkest days . riding the waves of that critical and commercial success , she released 2016’s heavn — capitalizing on her vocal strengths while expanding her lyrical content towards topics like racial identity , gender politics , hometown reflections , and internal purpose . through these topics , jamila never stops searching for her own personal heaven . “give me today my daily bread \/ help me to walk alone ahead \/ though i walk through the darkest valley i will fear no love \/ oh my smile my mind reassure me i don’t need no one” jamila opens the song with a steady and passionate vocal delivery that immediately absorbs you into the heady atmosphere of the track . she punctuates each word with an ever-so-slight staccato that perfectly lands in sync with the drum beat . this contrasting combination allows the gravity of each word to sink in while maintaining a comforting levity throughout the track . that levity allows us to maintain hope as jamila recounts the rollercoaster of feelings that comes with our lease on life . with references to christian theology , she acknowledges that the expedition of life is often one that is both solitary and spiritual . in this expedition , we will trek though the darkest valleys . trying to do this without a flashlight , guidebook , or a crew can be one of the most terrifying undertakings . yet when we remember that we always have ourselves for support through the ebbs and flows , a conviction so powerful begins to overtake us . with a new conviction , often comes an epiphany . “woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me \/ with my mind set on loving me \/ i’m not lonely , i’m alone \/ and i’m holy by my own” with a simple but enlightening chorus , jamila shifts the connotations of being alone that have been ingrained in so many of us . we can be surrounded by tons of people but still feel empty and lonely , and we can be all by ourselves yet brim with fulfillment . as we create more of the latter moments for ourselves , we make the sacred transition from loneliness to solitude . the electronic-tinged synth loops , jazz-influenced drum pattern , and soothing horns all build in a slow-moving fashion allowing for a steady energy that grows fuller as the song progresses with jamila’s journey . this instrumentation coupled with her heavenly and seasoned vocals , create an environment that is just as internally convicted as it is externally triumphant . this triumph is not without the acknowledgement of life’s hard truths . “ye , the bad days may come \/ the lover may leave \/ the winter may not \/ hey , the map of your palms \/ the temple you be \/ you’re all that you got” with these words and her mature-sounding vocal delivery , jamila gives an impression of someone who has seen pain and hardship directly in the face but has maintained a level of practical determination to not wither in the storms of life . as the horns crescendo and an injection of soulful crooning supports jamila’s final chorus , her determination transfers to the listening audience . we leave the song understanding that life is hard , but we begin to internalize the idea that our capacity to thrive in times of solitary strife may have been severely underrated . as college has come and gone , and i have moved to a major city , this stage of my life has naturally veered into a more solitary direction . i still see and connect with friends , family , and co-workers on a highly regular basis , but i also have begun to spend much more time alone . even more jarring than that , my life path has become much more of a solo endeavor . the intense camaraderie that defined my life has disappeared as i am no longer in the same structural bubble of the american education system . this change was difficult at first . what begun as a pretty intense bout of loneliness slowly transformed into a great focus on myself . i began to take much better care of my mental and physical health , creating a more disciplined food , sleep , and exercise routine , along with taking full advantage of my company’s free mental healthcare benefits . i started my music publication , which deeply reconnected me with my core values and made me profoundly optimistic of where i could take my dreams . all these changes skyrocketed my ability to be self-compassionate and deepened in me a strong sense of self-efficacy . these types of transformative experiences crystalize in the moments we spend with ourselves . these are times when we can ponder , reflect , and process our lives completely without distraction or input . eventually , this time of disconnection can lead us to a place where our greatest values and hopes are no longer this drifting ephemeral cloud that is impossible to grasp , but a burning spiritual fire that is at the forefront of our consciousness . while crippling and painful at first , this solitude eventually builds us in ways we could have never imagined . in this solitude , we find our freedom .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Solitude is often unfairly stigmatized in our society, with harsh judgments placed on those who choose to live a solitary life. The misconception that being alone signifies antisocial behavior, inadequacy, or even criminality hinders our ability to develop a deep relationship with ourselves and our own minds. Without a sense of conviction in our solitary experiences, we cannot achieve true inner peace and a sense of belonging in the world. It is through embracing solitude and finding a deeper sense of freedom within ourselves that our relationships, goals, and overall well-being can fully flourish.\n\nIn her remarkable debut album \"Heavy,\" Jamila Woods explores this theme of solitude in the penultimate track, \"Holy.\" The song serves as a testament to the human capacity to thrive and find fulfillment within oneself.\n\nWoods first gained recognition for her extraordinary vocal talent and profound lyrical depth on the 2015 album \"Surf\" by The Social Experiment. Her angelic, tender voice and spiritually-infused lyrics captivated audiences on the lead single \"Sunday Candy,\" leaving a lasting impression. Building on her success, Woods released \"Heavy\" in 2016, further showcasing her vocal strengths while delving into topics such as racial identity, gender politics, reflections on her hometown, and finding one's internal purpose. Throughout the album, Woods maintains her relentless search for personal fulfillment.\n\nThe opening lines of \"Holy\" immediately draw listeners into the song's immersive atmosphere, as Woods delivers a passionate vocal performance with steady intensity. She masterfully punctuates each word with a subtle staccato, perfectly synchronized with the drumbeat. This blend of gravity and levity allows the weight of her words to resonate, while also providing a comforting and uplifting experience.\n\n\"Holy\" acknowledges the solitary and spiritual nature of life's journey, drawing references from Christian theology. Woods recognizes that traversing this expedition alone, without a guidebook or a support system, can be terrifying. Nevertheless, she highlights the power of self-reliance and self-support during the inevitable ups and downs of life. Through her lyrics, Woods imparts a newfound conviction, creating an epiphany for listeners: being alone can be a source of fulfillment and holiness.\n\nThe slow-building electronic-tinged synth loops, jazz-influenced drum patterns, and soothing horns in \"Holy\" create an environment that is both internally resolute and externally triumphant. Woods' heavenly vocals, imbued with experience and depth, add to the song's instrumentation tapestry. As the song progresses, the energy steadily grows, reaching its peak with a soulful chorus that reinforces Woods' determination.\n\nWhile life transitions and geographical changes may lead us towards a more solitary path, this newfound solitude can become an opportunity for personal growth. Reflecting on my own experiences of moving to a major city and transitioning into a more solitary phase of life, I initially struggled with feelings of loneliness. However, this solitude ultimately allowed me to prioritize self-care and focus on my mental and physical well-being. Establishing disciplined routines for food, sleep, and exercise, along with taking advantage of available mental healthcare resources, enabled me to embrace self-compassion and solidify a strong sense of self-efficacy. Additionally, starting a music publication reignited my connection with my core values and fostered optimism for pursuing my dreams. These transformative experiences unfolded during moments of solitude, when I could fully contemplate, reflect, and process my life without distraction. Over time, this time of disconnection led me to a place where my deepest values and aspirations became tangible and ignited a spiritual fire within me. Though initially challenging and painful, solitude has the power to shape us in ways we never anticipated. It is in this solitude that we discover our true freedom. END"}
{"prompt":"when you think of working at google , what likely comes to mind are the legendary perks , the game rooms , free haircuts , and napping pods . but while the silicon valley titan has earned a reputation as a leader in corporate sustainability , less evident is its use of certain perks to encourage employees to reduce their own environmental footprints . likewise , sometimes the supersmart “googlers” are the ones pushing the green envelope . google’s sustainability cred comes in part from its status as the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy , not counting utilities . since 2010 , the company has signed 20 agreements to purchase roughly 2 . 6 gigawatts , about the same as taking 1 . 2 million cars off the road . google is also on track to reach its goal of using 100 percent clean power across its operations this year . to be clear , this does not mean that the company will run entirely on wind and solar , but that google will purchase renewable electricity each year equal to the amount of electricity its global operations consume . but clean energy is only part of the picture . the company has numerous energy efficiency and waste reduction initiatives at its offices and data centers , which save money while reducing environmental impact . because we’re talking about google , these efforts often involve the use of various digital technologies , including artificial intelligence ( more on that in a bit ) , to solve problems . for example , while google provides compost bins in its famous cafés where employees chow down on free gourmet meals , its chefs use digital scales designed by a company called leanpath to monitor supply and usage in the kitchen to improve meal planning and reduce waste in the preparation process . the company thinks about waste in a “broader framework” and is trying “to design waste out of our systems altogether , ” says kate brandt , chief sustainability officer at google . “it certainly has some parallels with energy efficiency — there’s a great business case for it as well a great environmental benefits . ” through its waste reduction , composting , and reuse and recycling programs , google has reached an 86 percent landfill diversion rate at its bay area offices and 78 percent globally . this year , the goal is another 10 percent reduction per bay area employee compared with 2015 , as well as a new set of regional targets . bikes and burgers food is one of two areas where perks at google overlap with incentivizing employees to shrink their environmental footprint . the other is transportation . first , workers must commute to the compounds where they infamously spend much of their time . the company’s shuttles , which run on 5 percent biofuel and include heavy-duty filtration systems , have been a fixture on bay area highways for a decade now . in 2015 , use of google shuttles and the more recently added corporate electric vehicles netted an annual savings of 29 , 000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions , the equivalent of taking 5 , 700 cars off the road . globally , the company has installed more than 1 , 600 electric vehicle charging ports at its offices and data centers , and employees can charge their cars at work for free . the company also gives an electric pedal-assist bike , lock , and helmet to any employee at its silicon valley headquarters who wants to make biking his or her primary means of commuting . the overall goal to reduce single-occupancy vehicle commuting at the headquarters to 45 percent by transitioning more workers to shuttles , carpooling , public transit , biking , and walking . ( google does not prohibit working from home , but neither does it particularly promote it . ) meanwhile , back at the company’s cafés , you’ll find more covert attempts at changing employee lifestyle . for example , google is subtly nudging its workers toward a less meat-intensive diet , according to a recent report by fast company . meat consumption contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions — by one estimate , raising livestock for meat , dairy , and eggs is responsible for 14 . 5 percent of emissions globally . google’s chefs prepare various vegan dishes — often made with “ugly produce” bought at a discount and saved from the landfill — but the company doesn’t try to convert meat lovers immediately to a fully vegetarian diet . instead , its strategy is to reduce meat consumption , such as with its “blended” burger that uses mushrooms to cut the amount of beef in each patty . now here’s the covert part over time , the company has slowly increased the percentage of mushrooms , which add moisture and soak up the flavor of the beef as they cook , in each burger from 20 percent to 50 percent . in other dishes , meat might shift from being the center of the meal to a side or garnish . geeking out on energy efficient data centers google corporate doesn’t always do the nudging . it has an incredibly talented staff coming up with new ideas during each lap in the onsite pool . brandt tells the story of jim gao , a former google efficiency engineer who last year made it his mission to use artificial intelligence to reduce energy use at the company’s data centers , which as of 2015 already used 50 percent less energy than the industry average . you probably don’t think about it every time you send an email , comment on a social media post , or watch the latest youtube clip , but it takes a network of enormous energy-consuming data centers to keep the internet humming 24\/7 . this connectivity , like everything , comes at a cost . globally , data centers consume 3 percent of the world’s energy ( around 420 terawatts ) and emit 2 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases , according to yole développement , a french market research and consulting company focused on the technology industry . google has 14 data centers around the world and has long considered its servers to be the front line of its sustainability efforts . gao did his work via a 20% project , a company program that allows employees to use 20 percent of their time at work to solve a particular problem . he had taken a class in machine learning , a type of ai that gives computers the ability to learn things without being explicitly programmed . basically , computers can teach themselves through repetition how to interpret large amounts of data . google was already using machine learning to improve features like language translation and image recognition . when you ask google photos for pictures of cats in a box , google’s machine learning algorithms find the photos you want . so goa wondered why not use this tech to reduce server energy use ? he soon discovered why not . with all of the different variables , goa and his data center intelligence team were looking at billions of distinct configurations , a set of possibilities far beyond the ability of any human to test . so goa joined forces with google’s leading ai research group , deepmind , which had recently gained attention for its work on a computer agent that taught itself to play not just one , but every atari game really well . ( goa now works for deepmind full-time . ) goa’s team and deepmind used a model of broader , more generalized algorithms and came up with a solution general beats specific . since their discovery , the models have been piloted at multiple data centers and have produced a 40 percent reduction in energy used for cooling and a 15 percent reduction in overall energy overhead . goa is far from an anomaly . “not a week goes by that i’m not talking to someone about a new idea or a potential 20% project , ” says brandt . google’s monstrous volume of servers has also become an example of deploying what’s called the “circular economy” at scale , says brandt . the circular economy is the buzzword for the latest incarnation of waste reduction , which involves designing more efficient systems ( or products or equipment ) where materials are endlessly cycled back through via repair , reuse , remanufacturing , refurbishing , and recycling . ( remember the leanpath scale ? that’s an example of designing waste out of a system . ) google starts with server maintenance so equipment can be used as long as possible . servers that can’t be kept on the floor get pulled off and sent to a central hub for remanufacturing . functioning parts that the company no longer needs , such as hard drives , are wiped clean and sold on the secondary market . anything left over gets recycled through the company’s recycling partners . last year , the company diverted 86 percent of its data center waste away from landfills . as of september , google’s goal is zero waste to landfills at all 14 of its locations . “we definitely set a stretch goal to reach zero waste to landfill , but this is the kind of challenge we get excited about , ” says brandt . “we like to solve these gnarly problems . ” solve on , gnarly googlers .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When considering employment at Google, the first thoughts that come to mind are often the fantastic perks such as game rooms, free haircuts, and napping pods. However, while Google has established itself as a leader in corporate sustainability, its use of certain perks to encourage employees to reduce their own environmental footprints is less well-known. In fact, it is sometimes the employees themselves who are driving the green initiatives.\n\nOne of the pillars of Google's sustainability efforts is its commitment to renewable energy. As the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable energy (excluding utilities), Google has signed 20 agreements since 2010 to purchase approximately 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy. This is equivalent to taking 1.2 million cars off the road. Moreover, Google is on track to achieve its goal of using 100 percent clean power across its operations this year. This does not mean that the company will rely solely on wind and solar energy, but rather that it will purchase renewable electricity equal to the amount of electricity it consumes each year.\n\nIn addition to clean energy, Google has implemented several energy efficiency and waste reduction initiatives at its offices and data centers. These initiatives not only reduce the company's environmental impact but also save money. These efforts often involve the use of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to solve problems. For instance, Google uses digital scales in its kitchens to monitor supply and usage, improve meal planning, and reduce waste. The company has also implemented waste reduction, composting, and recycling programs, resulting in an 86 percent landfill diversion rate at its Bay Area offices and 78 percent globally.\n\nTransportation is another area where Google's perks align with its aim of reducing environmental impact. The company operates shuttles that run on 5 percent biofuel, equipped with heavy-duty filtration systems. These shuttles, along with the electric vehicles available for employee use, have collectively reduced annual carbon dioxide emissions by 29,000 metric tons, equivalent to removing 5,700 cars from the road. Google has also installed over 1,600 electric vehicles charging ports globally, allowing employees to charge their cars for free at work. Furthermore, Google encourages biking to work by providing electric pedal-assist bikes, locks, and helmets to employees at its Silicon Valley headquarters.\n\nGoogle is also nudging its employees towards a more environmentally friendly diet. By offering vegan dishes made from \"ugly produce\" bought at a discount and saved from the landfill, Google aims to reduce meat consumption, as it is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the company has created a \"blended\" burger that incorporates mushrooms to reduce the amount of beef in each patty gradually.\n\nGoogle's commitment to sustainability extends to its data centers, which are crucial for keeping the internet running smoothly. These data centers consume 3 percent of the world's energy and emit 2 percent of global greenhouse gases. As of 2015, Google's data centers already used 50 percent less energy than the industry average. To further reduce energy consumption, Google employs artificial intelligence to optimize energy usage at its data centers. By utilizing machine learning algorithms developed by its research group, DeepMind, Google achieved a 40 percent reduction in energy used for cooling and a 15 percent reduction in overall energy overhead.\n\nGoogle's efforts to promote sustainability extend beyond its own operations. With its approach to waste reduction, such as designing more efficient systems and implementing recycling programs, Google exemplifies the circular economy at a large scale. The company aims for zero waste to landfills at all of its 14 locations.\n\nIn conclusion, Google's commitment to sustainability is evident not only through its renewable energy initiatives but also through its energy efficiency measures, waste reduction programs, and employee incentives. By utilizing digital technologies and embracing innovative ideas, Google continues to lead the way in corporate sustainability, inspiring other companies to follow suit. END"}

Rowling's Advice for Aspiring Writers: Elevating Your Writing Game\n\nJ.K. Rowling, the world's wealthiest writer, has experienced unprecedented success in the realm of children's literature. It may seem improbable, but she has consistently achieved remarkable results. As the legend goes, the idea for Harry Potter struck her while she was on a train. Without delay, she began writing as soon as she arrived home. This tale serves as a reminder that great ideas can arise unexpectedly. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly record them and devote time to fleshing them out, as they may lead you in new and exciting directions. This is where exceptional writing truly originates.\n\nTo truly become the best writer you can be, there is one simple practice you must employ continuously: write and discard the initial poor-quality drafts. In this context, the term \"rubbish\" refers to verbal garbage, as aptly expressed by Rowling. Mastery of any skill is achieved by initially being inadequate at it. When you first learn to drive, for example, it is wise to practice in an empty parking lot during school hours. This way, you avoid colliding with other cars or inconveniencing those behind you. By investing sufficient time in perfecting your craft, you alleviate any concerns about endangering others once you take to the actual road. The same principle applies to writing.\n\nParents are well aware that children are often born with an inherent inclination towards unwise behavior. Consequently, it becomes their duty to guide and discipline their children, steering them away from perpetual trouble. Although challenging, this process is essential in order for children to navigate life successfully. Similarly, when embarking on the journey of writing from a raw idea, the initial draft may not make complete sense. Rest assured, this is completely normal. Just as bodybuilders warm up their muscles before engaging in intense weightlifting, writers must warm up their pens before their words flow effortlessly and eloquently. Skipping this crucial practice will hinder your ability to become a truly exceptional writer. It is important to note that you need not share these initial drafts; they serve solely as a stepping stone towards excellence. However, the next point may seem counterintuitive.\n\nEmbracing and sharing your failures plays a vital role in your growth as a writer. The pursuit of perfection may be tempting, but it is ultimately unattainable. Perfection can be elusive as you can always find flaws when reevaluating your work the following day. Subjectivity also comes into play, as what one person may perceive as excellent, others may find disappointing. Trying to please everyone is an impossible feat. Instead, focus on connecting with those who resonate with your values and aspirations. Demonstrate your vulnerabilities and share your failures. While you may not feel particularly inclined to highlight these less-than-ideal experiences, framing them in the right context can instill hope in others longing for it. Few things make for a more valuable gift.\n\nRather than fixating on perfection, redirect your attention to effectiveness. Consider how you can leave a positive impact on someone, how your story can inspire others enduring their own struggles. Dig deep to convey your compassion while accepting and acknowledging your own imperfections. Honesty is key, as it fosters the strongest connections with readers. Now, am I suggesting you should lower your aspirations? Absolutely not. Instead, compete with yourself, aiming to surpass who you were yesterday. This is the only fair contest. Clearly define your mission, understanding the necessary steps towards its achievement. Regard each piece of writing as a contribution to the wider body of work dedicated to this purpose. The more you invest yourself in writing with passion and sincerity, the closer you come to realizing your mission. This journey commences by embracing and purging the initial flawed drafts, eventually yielding gold. END"}

Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, The Great Gatsby: \"Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.\" As this quote resonated within me, I became curious about its context within the book. Numerous quotes like this one are often extracted from literary works and shared across social media platforms, often devoid of their original meaning. Thus, I embarked on a quest to locate the quote, and I found it on page 107 of my edition of The Great Gatsby. It is a line of dialogue uttered by the character Jordan in response to Gatsby's love interest, Daisy, who laments about the perceived monotony of their future. \n\nUpon reading this exchange, I couldn't help but acknowledge the masterful craftsmanship of this dialogue. It prompted me to consider how I could develop my own skills in writing compelling and authentic conversations. As I delved further into the scene, I extracted three valuable lessons on crafting dialogue that I wished to share.\n\nFirstly, increasing conflict through contradiction is crucial as it propels both the narrative and the dialogue forward. Without conflict, a story would lack the intrigue that keeps readers engaged. In The Great Gatsby, conflict is abundant – from shocking plot twists to scandals and affairs. Similarly, dialogue benefits from tension and unpredictability. In the aforementioned lines, Jordan reproaches Daisy, injecting tension into the conversation and introducing unexpected elements that captivate readers' attention. Each character in your own work should possess a distinct personality, leading to disagreements rather than consensus. For a more extensive exploration of this concept, I have created a YouTube video on the dinner table exercise, which you can find here.\n\nPutting this principle into practice, I have personally found it helpful during the editing process of my recently completed novel. Initially, certain scenes comprised long-winded monologues that ultimately lacked interest. However, by introducing disagreement and questioning from other characters, these conversations became far more engaging to read and offered deeper insights into the characters' personalities. When crafting conversations in your own storytelling, I encourage you to experiment with having characters oppose one another. You may discover that the dialogue takes an unforeseen direction, enhancing the allure of your plot.\n\nSecondly, it is essential to avoid writing dialogue that is excessively explicit or \"on the nose.\" As I continued reading the scene from The Great Gatsby, I noticed that it was the moment where Daisy inadvertently confesses her love for Gatsby in front of her husband, Tom. Fitzgerald illustrates this interaction: \"'Who wants to go to town?' demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes floated towards her. 'Ah,' she cried, 'you look so cool.' Their eyes met, and they stared at each other, alone in space. With an effort, she glanced down at the table. 'You always look so cool,' she repeated.\" Instead of explicitly voicing her feelings for Gatsby, Daisy conveys her sentiments through subtlety. Fitzgerald masterfully skillfully underlines the underlying subtext. It serves as a poignant reminder for us as writers to avoid dialogue that is overtly straightforward. Instead, we should strive to create dialogue that contains depth and understated meaning.\n\nTo put this guidance into action, examine your own stories or manuscripts and identify any instances of on-the-nose dialogue. By rewriting these sections, you can make the scenes more engaging for your readers. Rather than having a character exclaim, \"I'm angry!\" demonstrate their anger through actions, facial expressions, and more subtly crafted dialogue. However, it is worth noting that \"on the nose\" dialogue can be appropriate in specific instances. For example, a demure, soft-spoken old lady suddenly expressing, \"I'm furious!\" would undoubtedly pique readers' curiosity. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid \"on the nose\" dialogue when it serves no purpose other than stating the obvious or fails to reveal additional details about the character's personality.\n\nFinally, dialogue can be a powerful vehicle for conveying the theme of your story. Fitzgerald deftly employs dialogue to hint at one of The Great Gatsby's central themes—the superficiality of the upper class, who conceal themselves behind their wealth. In his book \"Story craft,\" editor Jack Hart highlights the importance of incorporating a theme or lesson into one's writing. He asserts that themes provide readers with a sense of time well invested, emphasizing the value of reading with a purpose. Consequently, stories with profound lessons possess enduring qualities associated with great literature. Dialogue offers writers another avenue to convey their chosen themes. \n\nTo implement this approach effectively, it is crucial to strike a balance and refrain from having characters lecture readers with lengthily monologues. Fitzgerald's exemplary use of a single line of dialogue, \"Her voice is full of money,\" subtly alludes to the story's theme. Analyze your own work and determine if any characters, including the narrator, engage in preaching. Simplify their statements into memorable lines that encapsulate the essence of your intended theme. Conversely, if you feel that your work lacks a sufficiently emphasized theme, consider incorporating it through well-crafted dialogue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the study of Fitzgerald's novel would undoubtedly unveil further techniques for writing remarkable dialogue, the three principles outlined above serve as an excellent foundation. These techniques, though derived from the renowned author, are accessible and straightforward, enabling you to immediately enhance the quality of dialogue within your stories. END"}

Recently, Yesenia turned to Kodak, a renowned software development firm, to revamp their software processes to ensure improved efficiency, productivity, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nAfter extensive brainstorming sessions, the collaboration between Yesenia and Kodak led to the decision to migrate part of Yesenia's services to the cloud. This transformation has ushered in a modernized way of working that Yesenia can now independently implement in their future projects.\n\nOne of the key focuses of this partnership was the redesign of the architecture to streamline product development. Kodak was thrilled to assist Yesenia in propelling their product forward and accelerating their development process through technical expertise. The goal was to create an architecture that not only supports Yesenia's business model but also enhances it.\n\nIn order to achieve greater flexibility, scalability, and security, the decision was made to leverage cloud infrastructure. The team at Kodak opted for a microservices' architecture approach, as operating in the cloud offers improved system performance and facilitates ongoing maintenance. The image API provided by Yesenia was chosen as the first feature to migrate to the cloud.\n\nThe project commenced at the beginning of 2019, utilizing AWS and Node.js tools. To bolster their capabilities, Kodak enlisted the expertise of a senior and a junior coder, further augmenting their own knowledge base. While Nikolas, Juno, and Jan from Kodak focused on moving the image API into the cloud, Yesenia's programmers were able to continue their work seamlessly with the existing system.\n\nThe result of this collaboration is a cloud-based microarchitecture that provides clear direction and equips Yesenia with additional tools for the future. The project was executed swiftly and efficiently, requiring minimal investment in terms of both time and financial resources. This agile transition will enable Yesenia to replicate the same success with their other services in the future, allowing for the development and implementation of new features at an accelerated pace.\n\nAt the conclusion of the collaboration, Yesenia expressed their satisfaction with the outcome and lauded the smoothness of the entire process. Chukka Ylälahti, Co-founder & CEO of Yesenia, highlighted the exceptional speed and efficiency of Kodak's work, stating that \"working with Kodak has been a breeze. They were quick and efficient, and we got solid and concrete results fast.\"\n\nFor further information about this case study, please feel free to contact our CEO, Marko Loyola, at marko.loukkola@kodan.fi or by phone at +358 (0) 44 552 5952.

{"prompt":"our focus today will be on big tech companies . let’s take , for example , amazon , apple , etc . , amazon let’s say , for example , it is called as the gatekeeper of e-commerce . it reduces the competition and harms the consumers and people who are not putting their products on this particular platform . let’s say , for example , amazon has a huge amount of money in its kitty . it decimates the brick and mortar stores and it makes sure that it is collecting all the data of a particular customer . this also pushes a product to the customer such that his data and privacy are also compromised . so amazon being too big and has a huge market dominance has become impossible for other companies to dominate over amazon . apple apart from this , when it comes to apple . apple also favors its own applications . it also puts rivals at a disadvantage as well , and when it comes to apple and google , they are on a buying spree as well . whenever they see a competition that is popping up against the hegemony of these companies , they immediately buy that particular company rather than competing with them . instagram and whatsapp could have become the competitors of facebook , but since they saw that they could not compete with instagram , they immediately grab an opportunity to buy that specific company the same is with apple and google . when it comes to google , it buys at least one firm a month , and when it comes to apple , it buys two to three firms every single month , says statistics . so what would be the impact ? when it comes to the impact , the consumers or the customers who have been availing their services will have limited opportunities . since they have limited opportunities , they will not have multiple options as well . this ultimately means that they have to go buy that particular service only from big tech companies like amazon , google , apple , or in fact , facebook as well . and as a result , what will happen ? the consumer base will also start increasing only with respect to those big tech companies . so what will happen ? we are giving away our data , and this particular data , when it is given , can be violated , which will violate the right to privacy . initially , when facebook had come , initially when there was google as well , all these people used to respect the right to privacy with eventuality when there is no competition . they also take up our data and manipulate our data because data is the new fuel for facebook and google . so what do they do ? they target our inboxes with what is called as the advertisement with which we attempted to buy a particular product as well . they also understand what our political inclinations are , and they also play a political role as well . such is the devastation that they cause when it comes to the consumers . now when it comes to india . let’s look at some of the statistics . more than 400 million of whatsapp’s estimated two billion users are in india . amazon has around one-third of the share of online retail in india , neck to neck with flipkart , which was recently acquired by wal-mart . then we have india as facebook’s largest single market with around 270 million accounts . google completely dominates the search engine space in india . most smartphones in india are also android-based os . since they are dominating in india , this article suggests that for the competition commission of india and elsewhere in their own countries for more regulation . when it comes to countries in europe and the united states of america , they are also planning to break companies as well . one such suggestion was given by the federal agency in the united states of america . back in the 1980s , we have at&t , which had also gone too huge when it comes to its market . so what was decided by the federal agency back then ? they had to break this at&t and split this particular organization . similarly , they are also planning a proposal with respect to facebook as well . the split will be facebook as an independent organization . we will also have instagram as an independent organization or an application and whatsapp as an independent application . so this is a suggestion given by the federal agency . so they do not have all the hold in the market , and there are diversification and more options given to the customers as well . this is one of the proposals given by the federal agency and also in european countries as well . also , remember , when it comes to companies like facebook or google , they have a cozy relationship with political parties in india as well . so what we require is more regulations , more laws to control the dominance of the big tech firms . and at the same time , india does not have a privacy law . so when it comes up with privacy law , they have to make sure all these aspects of data collection are taken into the picture when a law is being drafted . gain access to expert view — subscribe to ddi intel\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Today, we will be discussing big tech companies, such as Amazon, Apple, and others. Amazon, often referred to as the gatekeeper of e-commerce, holds a significant amount of market power. This dominance has resulted in reduced competition and negative consequences for consumers and businesses not utilizing their platform. Moreover, Amazon's substantial financial resources have contributed to the decimation of brick and mortar stores while also enabling the collection of vast amounts of customer data. Unfortunately, this has led to concerns over compromised data privacy. Due to its extensive market dominance, Amazon has become nearly impossible for other companies to surpass.\n\nMoving on to Apple, it is evident that the company exhibits a favorable bias towards its own applications, putting its competitors at a disadvantage. Notably, both Apple and Google have developed a habit of acquiring potential rivals rather than engaging in fair competition. For instance, Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp prevented them from becoming direct competitors. Similarly, Google consistently purchases at least one firm per month, while Apple acquires two to three companies every month, according to statistics. Consequently, this consolidation of power results in limited opportunities for consumers, who are left with fewer choices and are compelled to rely on the services of big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook.\n\nMoreover, such market domination has adverse consequences for individual privacy rights. As we provide our personal data to these companies, the risk of privacy violations increases. In the past, when Facebook and Google initially emerged, they respected privacy rights. However, as competition reduced, these companies resorted to harvesting and manipulating our data, as data has become the new fuel for their operations. They target our inboxes with tailored advertisements, utilizing the information they gather about our preferences, including our political inclinations, thereby exerting political influence as well. Such practices are detrimental to consumers.\n\nNow, let's focus on India and explore some statistics. More than 400 million of WhatsApp's approximately two billion users are based in India. Amazon claims nearly one-third of the online retail share in India, closely competing with Flipkart, which was recently acquired by Walmart. Additionally, Facebook considers India its largest single market, with around 270 million accounts. Moreover, Google dominates the search engine space in India, and a majority of smartphones in the country operate on Android-based operating systems. Given this market domination in India, this article suggests that the Competition Commission of India, along with regulatory bodies in other countries, should consider implementing further regulations.\n\nIn Europe and the United States, there are already plans to address the overwhelming influence of these tech giants. For instance, the federal agency in the United States proposed splitting up AT&T due to its excessive market control in the 1980s. Similarly, there are proposals to regulate Facebook, which include separating it into an independent organization, along with Instagram and WhatsApp. This approach would ensure that these companies do not possess complete control over the market, fostering diversification and providing more options for consumers. Similar proposals have been suggested in European countries as well.\n\nIt is also crucial to recognize that companies like Facebook and Google maintain cozy relationships with political parties in India. In light of this, stricter regulations and laws are necessary to manage the dominance of big tech firms. Furthermore, India should consider implementing comprehensive privacy legislation, taking into account all aspects of data collection when drafting such a law.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the dominance of big tech companies poses challenges for competition, consumer choice, and privacy. Regulators in India and around the world must take swift action to address these concerns and ensure a more level playing field for all stakeholders. END"}
{"prompt":"we’ve got an obsession with productivity . “hacks” for life are everywhere , covering every aspect of human existence . we can hack relationships , jobs , household tasks , and more . so many of us are obsessed with efficiency in our own private sphere . our never ending search for peak productivity becomes a whole distraction from productivity in and of itself… so what is the answer then , for that person who doesn’t move at the same pace ? for whom doing anything seems to be hard ? who never seems motivated or interested in anything ? when i started grappling with my own mental health , i remember becoming distinctly aware of the notion that one should just “buck up” , and get on with things — that that was the only “real” way out of depression . “just do more stuff , ” came the advice . perhaps this is the obvious argument in a world where we are all driven to do more , when we see someone who doesn’t seem driven anywhere . “doing more” seems like the obvious counter . that absolutely does not work for someone who is depressed having commitments , activities and routine can certainly help prevent depression and keep things moving . but in a low , just pummelling yourself with the guilt associated with not doing anything will really do very little for you . so is that person being lazy , or are they actually depressed ? mental health is such a complex issue , and i have written many times about depression and how to handle it . the only possible way i have noticed that we can differentiate between laziness and an actual problem comes when that person is out of the worst part of the cycle . most people i know with depression aren’t content to keep on suffering — in my opinion , it’s pretty hard to be okay with being depressed . obviously they’re unhappy — low moods are part of depression — but they also want to know that there’s another option and much of the time , unless they are really truly in the lowest part of the cycle , they want potentially to work towards a better place . at the lowest point , this isn’t something that can even be imagined . if someone is suicidal , they aren’t thinking about changing their depression , they’re thinking about what would give relief , most quickly . because depression is painful . laziness , on the other hand , is something else entirely . and the lazy person doesn’t really seem to mind quite so much — it isn’t painful to them to be that way . it’s easy . and easy is what they’re going for . so , firstly engage in some direct self reflection it’s pretty hard to outwardly tell the difference sometimes between laziness and depression , even for ourselves . only you , as an individual , can ask yourself for the truth and face your own reality . are you dealing with a mental health problem , or have you always shown a tendency towards laziness ? most people don’t become lazy overnight . so think back how likely were you to finish things in school ? or keep up hobbies ? how often do you see projects or ideas through to completion , or keep on working at something until you feel you’ve achieved something tangible ? are you looking for the first opportunity to shift into a new shiny activity ? or are you always picking up new hobbies ? are you someone who leaves things unfinished ? if none of this sounds like you but lately things have been getting darker , harder to deal with , and the world seems a bit more grey than it should , you might well be experiencing low mood and potentially even depression . in which case , you need to start by understanding that , and how to take care of yourself in that mode . set the baseline and break it down into achievable parts we’ve all got to eat healthy , exercise and sleep , in order to have the energy to do things we want or need to do . so it’s time to set the baseline when should you be getting into bed each night ? how can you ensure that you do that ? do you need to create a nighttime routine ? what about in the morning ? i’m personally quite a light sleeper , so one alarm and i’m up . but you need to learn how to make mornings work for you . that doesn’t mean cramming in an entire second life before work , the way many productivity blogs advise . i personally do do that , i’ll be honest but i love mornings . if you are not a morning person , then work with it , not against it . consider taking up meditation . find a type of exercise that works for you , that you actually enjoy . take these things one step at a time and practice some self-compassion as you experiment . take note of what works , and what definitely doesn’t work — literally write it down . figure out where your focus should be values . they’re everything . i wrote about this recently , because i think the process of figuring out your core values is really important . often laziness comes from an inability to focus on what you need to do — things feel overwhelming perhaps , or there’s so much to get done that you feel paralysed . but taking a breath and a step back is really important . figure out what should be holding your attention — where your values truly lie . from here , there’s a much better chance you will be able to get moving again . it’s the fog of laziness and an inability to prioritise that can become easy stopping points . it’s time face your fears sometimes ‘laziness’ is actually just ‘fear’ in disguise . like , you’re afraid to commit to doing something you might fail at . i know what that’s like . intimately . and living that way isn’t great . it’s a pretty good way to subject yourself to constant unease and guilt . because ultimately only we can decide to bite the bullet and commit to doing the thing that scares us most . and if it’s living life the way you really want to , it comes down to this will you be okay to die wondering ? ultimately , what will my life look like , when i look back on it ? the idea that i might get old and die without having ever tried was more terrifying than any of my objections — than any other fear my mind could conjure up . i needed to write . i needed to try and to know my own currency . so… do one thing first just one thing that will move you in the direction of your values . making the conscious effort to stop sitting around or finding excuses to do whatever is easiest is going to be the tough first step . put down the game , stop instagramming , don’t text gifs to your friends . just think what is it i want to be doing with my life ? what are my values ? and what one thing can i do to enact them ? even if it is starting with making a list . just start .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In today's society, there is a prevalent obsession with maximizing productivity and finding life hacks for every aspect of our lives. It seems like everyone is focused on efficiency and constantly searching for ways to do more. However, this fixation on productivity can become a distraction in itself and hinder our actual progress. \n\nFor those individuals who don't seem to operate at the same pace as others, it raises the question of how they can find their own path to success. Some may perceive this as laziness, suggesting that they should simply \"buck up\" and push through. However, this approach doesn't work for someone dealing with depression or other mental health issues. \n\nWhile commitments, activities, and routine can help prevent depression and keep things moving, relentlessly pressuring oneself with guilt for not being productive won't lead to any positive outcomes. It is crucial to differentiate between laziness and depression, as mental health is a complex issue. \n\nThe difference becomes more apparent when someone is out of the worst part of a depressive cycle. Most individuals experiencing depression are not content with remaining in that state. They are actively seeking ways to improve and find relief from their suffering, except during the lowest points when they are consumed by thoughts of despair. On the other hand, laziness is not painful and is a state that some individuals are comfortable with. They seek the path of the least resistance and prioritize ease over productivity. \n\nTo truly discern whether you are dealing with laziness or depression, engaging in self-reflection is crucial. Only you, as an individual, can ask yourself the difficult questions and face your own reality. Consider your past tendencies, such as completing tasks, maintaining hobbies, and seeing projects through to completion. Have you always shown a tendency towards laziness or is this a recent development accompanied by a darker mood? If the latter is true, it is possible that you are experiencing low mood or even depression, in which case you need to learn how to take care of yourself in that state. \n\nSetting a baseline for yourself is essential. Ensuring that you have a healthy sleep schedule, exercise regularly, and eat well provides the energy necessary to do the things you desire or need to achieve. Create a routine that works for you, both in the evening and in the morning. If mornings are not your strong suit, embrace that and find ways to make it work in your favor. Additionally, consider incorporating meditation and finding an exercise routine that you genuinely enjoy. It is crucial to approach these changes with self-compassion and observe what works and what doesn't, documenting your progress along the way. \n\nFurthermore, identifying your core values is vital. Laziness often stems from an inability to focus on priorities due to feeling overwhelmed or having too much on one's plate. Take a moment to step back and breathe, and then determine what truly holds importance to you. With this newfound clarity, you will have a better chance of finding motivation and getting back on track. Laziness and an inability to prioritize can be overcome by understanding your values. \n\nFear is also a common disguise for laziness. Sometimes, we avoid committing ourselves to tasks or goals because we are afraid of the possibility of failure. However, living with constant unease and guilt is not fulfilling. It requires us to confront our fears and make a conscious decision to pursue what truly matters to us. When it comes down to it, we must ask ourselves if we are willing to live our lives filled with regret and never having tried. \n\nTaking action is crucial, even if it is just starting with one small thing that aligns with your values. Breaking the cycle of inactivity and excuses is the difficult first step. Put aside distractions like games, social media, and texting, and focus on what you truly want to achieve in your life. What are your values, and what is one thing you can do right now to progress towards them? Even if it is as simple as making a list, taking that first step is vital. END"}

It turns out that there is a scientific explanation for this phenomenon. According to Julia Cameron, author of The Artist's Way, and experts in the field, our brains are most receptive to creative thoughts when we engage in repetitive actions that do not require intense concentration, such as walking, washing dishes, showering, or gardening.\n\nNeuroscientists who study the brain have discovered that exercise not only strengthens our muscles and body functions but also generates new neurons and neural connections in the brain. In an interview with scientists for Psychology Today, athlete and coach Christopher Berg land found that non-academic pursuits, including aerobic exercise, play a vital role in improving cognition and long-term success in life. In my various blog posts for Psychology Today, I have explored the links between physical activity, playing musical instruments, engaging in artistic activities, improving motor skills, and obtaining sufficient sleep, all of which contribute to optimizing brain function and enhancing cognitive abilities.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation: when our brains are not occupied with specific tasks, they are free to wander and explore. They traverse the fields of memories, processing the overwhelming influx of information from advertisements, phone calls, videos, and social media. Our brains revel in making connections and solving puzzles, engaging in imaginative scenarios and brainstorming new ideas. For instance, contemplating \"what if\" scenarios, like introducing characters from different books, can lead to exciting and fruitful creative outcomes (but of course, one should ensure that all characters involved are in the public domain).\n\nOne effective method of capturing these spontaneous bursts of inspiration is to engage in rhythmic activities that allow the mind to relax and flow. For example, swimming has often proven helpful in resolving plot glitches for me personally; Julia Cameron also recommends swimming and more meditative practices like knitting. It was during a swimming session that a solution to a plot quandary in one of my novels surfaced effortlessly. Instead of forcing our brains to find a solution, it seems that eureka moments occur when we least expect them, when our conscious mind is occupied with something else or completely idle. Christopher Berg land confirms these experiences in Psychology Today, highlighting that creative solutions rarely emerge through sheer force of will.\n\nIt is important to incorporate these activities into our daily routines, not only for the sake of having a clean house or a healthy body but also for our overall well-being and creative input. It is essential to approach these activities with a relaxed mindset, allowing ideas to flow naturally. Consider using a Dictaphone or speaking out loud, similar to the concept of morning pages, to capture your thoughts. Eventually, the ideas will come, and it is crucial to welcome and organize them without judgment, as you never know when a seemingly unrelated idea may turn out to be the perfect fit.\n\nIn the famous film Field of Dreams, Kevin Costner's character is told, \"Build it, and they will come!\" The same principle applies here. Give it a try and observe the results for yourself. We would love to hear about your experience! END"}

before you start writing , ask yourself is this story a story that needs to be told ? if you have read many articles addressing the same issue or explaining the same concept , think twice before writing another one . if you have a radical , new take on an old chestnut , we want to hear from you… but , we need you to persuade us that your article is something special that distinguishes itself from the pack and speaks to our audience . conversely , if your article addresses an underserved area or presents a new idea or method , that’s just what we are after ! 2 . what is your message ? let us know what your ‘take home message’ is , right from the start . give your piece a snappy introduction that tells us what is your novel idea ? why should we care ? how are you going to prove your point ? once you’ve got that out of the way , you can be as conversational as you like , but keep calling back to the central message and give us a solid conclusion . remember though , towards data science is not your personal blog , keep it sharp and on-topic ! 3 . on the internet , nobody knows you are a dog you’ve got a new idea or a new way of doing things , you want to tell the community and start a discussion . fantastic , that’s what we want too , but we’re not going to take for granted that you know what you are talking about or that we should uncritically believe what you say… you’ve got to persuade us ( your audience ) that the subject matter is important there is a gap that needs to be filled you have the answer your solution works your idea is based on a logical progression of ideas and evidence if you are giving us a tutorial , tell us why people would need to use this tool and why your way is better than the methods already published . you can do this by explaining the background , showing examples , providing an experiment or just laying out how data you have extracted from various sources allowed you to synthesise this new idea . are there arguments that counter your opinion or your findings ?

We value your contributions and encourage you to submit your articles. However, we kindly request that you consider the following points if you do not have professional writing experience. Our goal is to publish high-quality, professional articles that captivate our readers. It is important to note that if you do not adhere to our submission guidelines, your article may not be accepted.\n\n1. Is Your Story Worth Telling?\nBefore you start writing, ask yourself if your story truly needs to be told. If you have come across numerous articles addressing the same issue or explaining the same concept, take a moment to reconsider writing another one. However, if you possess a unique and radical perspective on a familiar topic, we are interested in hearing from you. You must convince us that your article offers something special, distinguishing itself from others and resonates with our audience. On the other hand, if your article tackles an overlooked or unexplored area, or introduces a new idea or methodology, that is precisely what we are looking for.\n\n2. What is Your Message?\nClearly communicate your main idea or \"take home message\" right from the start. Craft an engaging introduction that effectively conveys your novel idea. Address why your article is significant and why readers should care. Outline how you plan to substantiate your point. Once you have set the groundwork, feel free to adopt a conversational tone. However, always return to your central message and conclude your article with a solid and impactful ending. Remember, Towards Data Science is not a personal blog. Keep your writing focused and on-topic.\n\n3. Showcase Your Expertise\nHaving a new idea or approach is commendable, but it is crucial to persuade your audience that your knowledge is reliable and valuable. You must demonstrate:\n\n- The importance of the subject\n- A gap that needs to be filled\n- The effectiveness of your proposed solution or idea\n- A logical progression of ideas and supporting evidence\n\nIf you are presenting a tutorial, explain why individuals should utilize the tool you are introducing and demonstrate why your method is superior to those already published. You can achieve this by providing background information, offering examples, conducting experiments, or explaining how you synthesized data from various sources to develop your new concept. Address any potential counterarguments and explain why your viewpoint prevails.\n\n4. Crafting a Captivating Title and Subtitle\nYour article requires a concise, attention-grabbing title accompanied by a descriptive and insightful subtitle. These elements should help readers understand what your article is about and why they should read it. Avoid using titles or subtitles written in all capital letters and refrain from using profanity. Proper formatting of your subtitle is crucial, as it will appear in post previews, influencing your click-through rate. To ensure correct formatting on Medium, type out your subtitle, highlight the text, and click the smaller \"t\" icon in the popup window.\n\n5. Delivering Value to Your Readers\nEnsure that your article achieves its intended purpose. If your goal is to explain concepts, distill them down to their core essentials, present them in a logical sequence, and support them with simple and accurate analogies. Use concrete language and visual imagery to engage readers on a sensory level. As Steven Pinker argues in his book \"The Sense of Style,\" readers comprehend and remember information better when it is expressed in vivid, concrete language that allows them to form mental images. Continuously work on improving your writing skills, such as replacing weak linking and light verbs with precise action verbs. Proofread thoroughly for spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. If you need assistance, use tools like Grammarly and seek help from a friend. Due to our limited team size, we cannot correct every submission.\n\n6. Displaying Code Effectively\nAvoid screenshotting your code; instead, utilize one of the following methods for code display:\n\n- Use Medium's native code blocks and inline code embedding features.\n- Embed your code using GitHub Lists.\n\nIf you include code within your article, ensure it is explained clearly so that all readers can follow along.\n\n7. Fact-checking and Credibility\nWhenever you provide a fact, particularly if it is not self-evident, include the source or reference where you obtained the information. Provide details about your sources and the origin of your data. Our conversations can only progress if we all have the same foundation of knowledge. While your statements may ignite discussions, it is crucial to refer back to the original source in case any vital components are missing from your article.\n\n8. Concise and Non-Promotional Conclusion\nInclude a conclusion at the end of your article to help readers review and retain the essential points you covered. You can use the conclusion to link to an original post or relevant articles. However, do not request claps or donations, and limit the number of links to previously published articles to three or fewer. Readers are aware that they can click on your profile to access all your posts and follow you, so there is no need to explicitly request it. When referencing sources, follow this format: [x] N. Author, Title (Year), Source. For example, your first reference should appear as: [1] A. Peak, A. Henkel and G. Couple, \"Recurrent Machines for Likelihood-Free Inference\" (2018), Neurons 2018 Workshop on Meta-Learning.\n\n9. Precise and Relevant Tags\nSelect tags that are precise and accurate to facilitate readers' ability to find your article. Thoughtfully choose tags related to data science, machine learning, programming, or visualization, depending on your content's focus. We do not allow a single post to be featured in all categories simultaneously, so we may make slight adjustments to your tags before publication to ensure relevancy within our different sections. For instance, we would not tag a post focused on linear regression as \"artificial intelligence.\"\n\n10. Exceptional Featured Image\nAn eye-catching and captivating image can greatly enhance reader engagement. Here are some options to consider for adding a fantastic featured image to your post:\n\n- Utilize Unsplash, a platform with a vast collection of photos released under the Creative Commons CC0 license, allowing safe and free usage, even for commercial purposes.\n- Capture your own unique image using your smartphone or any other available camera.\n- Create a visually appealing graph using tools like R, Python, D3.js, or Plot.\n\nIf you decide to purchase an image license, please ensure that it does not expire and permits commercial use. You are solely responsible for complying with the license terms of use. Include a caption below the image in the following format: \"Image via [license provider's name] under license to [your name].\" Additionally, please email us a copy of the receipt or other evidence of the purchased license, along with the corresponding license terms. Even if you are not obligated by law, it is important to cite the source of your images. If you created an image yourself, you can add \"(Image by Author)\" to the caption. The image source citation in your submission should adhere to this format.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you are enhancing the chances of your article being accepted for publication. We appreciate your efforts in creating valuable and engaging content for our readers. END"}

In the United States alone, the numbers associated with the ongoing pandemic are truly alarming. With a staggering 13.7 million reported cases of the novel coronavirus and nearly 270,000 lives lost, it begs the question of why anyone would consider travel a prudent choice at this time.\n\nOne could argue that if people were venturing off to unfamiliar destinations, where they wouldn't be exposed to large crowds, it might be a different story. Unfortunately, that is hardly the case. People are still flocking to places like Disney, which recently reopened its doors for business, albeit without the inclusion of its water parks. The only prerequisite for entry, if you happen to be above the age of two, is to ensure that you wear a mask at all times. While wearing masks is undeniably crucial, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify subjecting oneself to the potential dangers and detrimental consequences associated with large crowds, such as those frequently found at Disney.\n\nThis behavior not only poses a significant risk to individuals but also has widespread destructive repercussions. No amount of cherished memories or momentary delights is worth the potential for loss of life or, at the very least, severe illness. The responsibility for the reopening of such establishments lies at the feet of the companies themselves, who agreed to operate under such precarious circumstances. Additionally, our government should be held accountable for their failure to take decisive actions in order to prevent the situation from escalating. Nevertheless, we must also cast a discerning eye upon the citizens of the United States, who seem unable or unwilling to postpone their personal plans for a little longer, in order to ensure their own safety as well as the safety and well-being of others.\n\nUndoubtedly, the prospect of embarking on a vacation would be a welcome relief for many families, including mine. Since March, we have been confined within the confines of our own homes, constantly in each other's presence. While it is delightful to spend time with our loved ones, there comes a point when we must acknowledge that enough is enough. However, even during these trying times, there is no vacation that can justify compromising our well-being. We have exhibited great caution by refraining from gathering for a small Thanksgiving celebration, merely to safeguard ourselves from potential infection. Regardless of whether we have children, are single or married, our health and well-being should remain paramount. Consistently adhering to mask-wearing protocols, venturing outside solely when absolutely necessary, and avoiding crowds are critical steps we can take to combat this pandemic.\n\nIndulging in a family vacation simply because it has been a customary tradition is an ill-advised response. The state of the world has drastically changed, demanding our adaptability and perseverance. It is imperative that we weather the storm and stay at home during this holiday season, wisely choosing to plan our future vacations for a time when it is undeniably safer to do so. Failing to exercise caution may result in the unfortunate reality that the vacation memories we hold dear today may become the very last ones we have the privilege to create. END"}

( mtheiler ) , cc by-sa 4 . 0 , via wikimedia commons what is object detection ? humans’ intrinsic ability to rapidly detect , differentiate , and classify objects allows us to make quick decisions regarding what we see . detection of objects in images remains one of the most significant challenges in the field of computer vision since objects found in images can be perceived from the most diverse viewpoints and transformations in size and rotation , making it more difficult to detect . digital cameras provide good advantages among the critical sensors that ai can use they can be

bio-inspired learning models have been studied to identify and classify vehicles . object detection is crucial for good object recognition . a classification technique is to formulate it as a classification problem . objects are instances with well-defined limits and center , unlike the background . methods for detecting and recognizing objects require fewer resources to perform rapid detection due to the increased computational cost . the advanced and complex classifier , such as the cnn — convolutional neural network , is necessary to obtain high accuracy in the detections . detection theories can be used to classify small , low cost or low consumption , electronics , transportation , health , safety , among other areas . aphex34 , cc by-sa 4 . 0 , via wikimedia commons the cnn object detection problem the difference between object classification methods ( like the networks in the previous section ) and object detection methods is that in object detection , you want to identify how many objects of a given category are in the image objects of a given category are in the image identify where in the image each object is located . it is typically not known in advance how many instances of a given object category you will identify in a scene . if you were to build a standard cnn to solve this problem , you would have the following situation the output size is variable . it depends on how many instances of an object you will find and where they are , which is impossible on a network with an output layer of fixed size . for this , models such as r-cnn and yolo were developed . r-cnn regions with cnn feature r-cnn performs segmentation based on the results of object detection . r-cnn initially uses selective search to extract many candidates and then calculates its characteristics through cnn . finally , it classifies each region using a specific linear classifier , usually svm ( support vector machines ) . unlike the networks discussed in the previous section , r-cnn can perform more complex tasks , such as object detection and coarse segmentation of images . an r-cnn can be built on traditional image classification networks , such as alexnet , vgg , googlenet , and resnet . r-cnn solves the problem of multiple exits using a selective search as follows 1 . generate initial sub-segmentation we generate many candidate regions 2 . use a greedy algorithm to combine similar regions into larger ones recursively 3 . use the generated regions to produce the final candidate region proposals r-cnn initially generates around 2000 candidates using the above algorithm based on simple traditional computer vision techniques . from there each candidate is reformatted to a standard size square image image is fed to a neural network that generates 4096-dimension feature vectors as output an svm classifies the vector of characteristics producing two outputs a rating an offset indication that can be used to adjust the bounding box . disadvantages of the model slow to train training is in two stages very slow to execute for each image , r-cnn first classifies 2000 sub-images . fast-r-cnn fast region-based convolutional networks for object detection in an article the following year , the authors of r-cnn presented a solution that solves the problems of slowness in the approach based on the analysis of 2000 semi-random images of r-cnn convolutional preprocessing . instead of feeding the neural network with candidate images , the entire image is provided to the network to generate a convolutional feature map ( cfm ) . this cfm is then used to search for candidate regions , which are reformatted into fixed-size square images through a region-of-interest pooling layer ( roi pooling ) . from the characteristic vector generated for each roi , a classification is performed with a softmax layer , which predicts the object category and associates it with the origin square’s bounding box . the graph below shows a comparison between the two approaches and another network from the same time , spp-net ( spatial pyramid pooling in deep convolutional networks for visual recognition ) faster-r-cnn towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks again , the same authors found a solution to make the network even faster was to eliminate the selective search for regions of interest . similar to fast r-cnn , the image is used directly as an input to generate a convolutional feature map . in this model , however , instead of performing a selective search on this map , a second , separate neural network is used to predict candidate regions . it is called the region proposal network ( rpn ) . rpn uses a neural mini-network based on a sliding window that analyzes the input image , and the translation is invariant . to avoid excessive proposals , suppression of non-maximums is carried out at this stage . these candidate regions , like fast-r-cnn , are reformatted into fixed-size square images through a region-of-interest pooling layer ( roi pooling ) . from the characteristic vector generated for each roi , a classification is performed with a softmax layer , which predicts the object category and associates it with the bounding box given by the square of origin . the image below shows a comparison between the three models of the authors and spp-net source single shot detection convolutional neural networks for object recognition the above approaches use to focus on the sub-regions of the image to identify objects . the network never looks at the image as a whole . here we will see approaches that consider the image as a whole . you only look once yolo in yolo , a single convolutional network predicts both the bounding boxes and the probabilities of belonging to each detected object’s class . for this , yolo works as follows an image is taken and divided into an sxs grid of cells using the grid as a reference , m bounding boxes are generated bounding boxes with a probability above a threshold are selected and used to locate the object within the image . much faster yolo ( 45 fps on the authors’ set -> up to two orders of magnitude ) faster than contemporary algorithms . its biggest flaw is inaccuracy with small objects in the image . each cell in the grid can predict b bounding boxes ( bbox ) and c class probabilities . a bbox prediction has five components ( x , y , w , h , confidence ) . the coordinates ( x , y ) represent the center of the bbox relative to the location of the cell ( if the center of a bbox does not fall into a cell , it will not be responsible for it and will not represent it -> cells only have a reference to objects whose center falls into them ) . these coordinates are normalized to [0 , 1] . the bbox ( w , h ) dimensions are also normalized to [0 , 1] , relative to the image size . suppose you split a 448 × 448-pixel image into a grid of sxs = 3 × 3 cells in yolo , the concept of intersection over union ( iou ) plays an important role the confidence of a prediction in yolo is given by pr ( object ) * iou ( pred , truth ) . detecting 3d objects in real-time . while there are ample amounts of 3d data for street scenes , due to the popularity of research into self-driving cars that rely on 3d capture sensors like lidar , datasets with ground truth 3d annotations for more granular everyday objects are minimal . to overcome this problem , we developed a novel data pipeline using mobile augmented reality ( ar ) session data . with the arrival of arcore and arkit , hundreds of millions of smartphones now have ar capabilities and the ability to capture additional information during an ar session , including the camera pose , sparse 3d point clouds , estimated lighting , and planar surfaces . we built a novel annotation tool for ar session data to label ground truth data , allowing annotators to label 3d bounding boxes for objects quickly . this tool uses a split-screen view to display 2d video frames on overlaid 3d bounding boxes on the left , alongside a view showing 3d point clouds , camera positions , and detected planes on the right . annotators draw 3d bounding boxes in the 3d view and verify its location by reviewing the projections in 2d video frames . for static objects , we only need to annotate an object in a single frame and propagate its location to all frames using the ground truth camera pose information from the ar session data , making the procedure highly efficient . mediapipe is google’s cross-platform framework for creating different data processing pipelines . objetron is included within this framework as a moving pipeline for real-time 3d object detection . in other words , objectron detects objects through 2d images to later estimate their orientation and size through a machine learning model trained on a 3d data set . in other words , it is capable of detecting 3d objects from a single rgb image . but understanding objects in 3d remains a challenging task due to the lack of large real-world datasets compared to 2d tasks ( e . g . , imagenet , coco , and open images ) . so , to empower the research community for continued advancement in 3d object understanding , there is a strong need for the release of object-centric video datasets , which capture more of the 3d structure of an object , while matching the data format

enables real-time detection of 3D objects. This innovative solution allows smartphones to accurately recognize the size and orientation of objects, opening up new possibilities in various applications.\n\nObject detection is a challenging task in computer vision, as objects can appear in images from different viewpoints, undergo transformations in size and rotation, making it difficult to detect. However, digital cameras, like those found in smartphones, offer several advantages as they are lightweight, compact, and cost-effective, making them ideal for object detection applications.\n\nTo achieve object detection goals, researchers have studied methods such as image information extraction, visual attention models, and bio-inspired learning models. These methods aim to identify and classify objects by using well-defined object boundaries and centers, which distinguish them from the background. It is essential for object recognition to utilize methods that require fewer computational resources while maintaining rapid detection. Complex classifiers, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), provide high accuracy in object detection.\n\nDifferent object detection approaches have been developed to address varying needs. For instance, methods like R-CNN (Regions with CNN Features) utilize selective search to generate initial sub-segmentations, which are then used to classify each region using a specific linear classifier. Although R-CNN is capable of performing complex tasks such as object detection and coarse segmentation, it has certain drawbacks, including slow training and execution.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, faster R-CNN was introduced, where the entire image is provided to a network to generate a convolutional feature map. This map is then used to search for candidate regions that are reformatted into fixed-size square images through region-of-interest pooling. Similarly, region proposal networks (RPN) were developed to predict candidate regions in real-time without the need for selective search. These techniques, like SPP-Net (Spatial Pyramid Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition), significantly improve the speed of object detection.\n\nAnother approach that considers the image as a whole is You Only Look Once (YOLO). YOLO utilizes a single convolutional network to predict both bounding boxes and probabilities of detected objects. By dividing the image into a grid of cells, YOLO generates bounding boxes and selects those with probabilities above a certain threshold. While YOLO is much faster compared to contemporary algorithms, it may have accuracy limitations for small objects.\n\nGoogle's Media pipe Objection leverages the advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology to detect 3D objects in real-time. By utilizing AR session data, including camera poses, sparse 3D point clouds, estimated lighting, and planar surfaces, Media pipe Objection creates a novel annotation tool for labeling ground truth data. This tool allows annotators to quickly label 3D bounding boxes for objects by drawing them in a split-screen view alongside 2D video frames.\n\nThe model underlying Media pipe Objection follows an encoder-decoder architecture based on MobileNetV2, Google's neural networks for classification and visual detection. By combining 2D projections of images, 3D estimation algorithms, bounding box application, object detection through Gaussian distribution, and image segmentation, Media pipe Objection achieves real-time detection capabilities.

What I am highlighting is the importance of finding a sustainable pace that works for you. It is crucial to pursue consistency and intention in your writing practice for extended periods, rather than experiencing a fleeting sense of accomplishment while pushing yourself to the brink of exhaustion. Choose the approach that enables you to improve your writing skills and maintain a lifelong commitment to your craft. And it's important to note that being an artist does not necessitate misery. Strive to find happiness and maintain good health – your work, body, and mind will all benefit from it.\n\nNow, allow me to be candid with you. There are days when even completing the simplest tasks, like taking a shower, feels like a monumental challenge. On those days, my anxiety weighs heavily, almost palpably, on my chest. Sometimes, it even extends to my throat, silencing my already stifled voice. It is on those difficult days that I choose not to write, despite the fear that I am not doing enough or being productive. Deep down, I am aware that I produce my best writing when I am well-rested and ideas effortlessly flow from my mind onto the computer screen, without exerting excessive efforts.\n\nHave you ever accomplished something and then found yourself exclaiming with a mix of pride, excitement, and a touch of confusion, \"I did that?\" That is where you want to be – not struggling to coerce words onto the page as if it were a burdensome chore, but rather engaging in a creative process that ultimately brings you fulfillment. I urge you to embrace activities that bring you joy, whether it be indulging in a bingeworthy TV show, finally finishing those neglected books on your desk, going out for a cup of tea, embarking on a hike, hitting the gym, or immersing yourself in the tranquility of the woods. And don't forget to prioritize naps, as they are truly revitalizing! Do whatever it takes to take care of yourself, mentally and physically. Self-care may sound cliché, but it is your fundamental responsibility.\n\nIf your journey towards artistic success takes a bit longer, that is perfectly alright. After all, what purpose does success serve if it fails to bring you happiness? Success may cultivate a momentary high – a surge of exhilaration that lasts for a few minutes, or perhaps even a few days if you are fortunate. Yet inevitably, that feeling dissipates, and you are left alone once again, confronted by your own desolation. So, I implore you to consider this: would you rather experience contentment alongside your achievements, or would you prefer to feel hollow and empty because you have exhausted yourself completely? The choice is yours to make. END"}
{"prompt":"deepmind’s alphafold . three decades after casp issued its challenge to the scientific community , a most promising solution has surfaced using ai to predict the shapes of protein structures with accuracy that has yet to be seen . deepmind , a company devoted to developing artificial intelligence systems to solve intelligence and advance scientific discovery , partnered with casp to solve biology’s grand challenge . alphafold is deepmind’s deep-learning system that has been proven to “accurately predict the structure of proteins to within the width of an atom” . alphafold was trained to analyze the structure of proteins using a databank of roughly 170 , 000 protein structures . during testing , alphafold achieved an average score of 92 . 4 gdt ( global distance test ) in its predictions . the competitive threshold score 90 gdt . this means that alphafold’s abilities are easily competitive with the results obtained using experimental methods , such as cryo-electron microscopy , nuclear magnetic resonance , and x-ray crystallography . these experimental methods can take years to determine the shape of a protein . in contrast , alphafold can manage it in a few days . achieving a score of over 90 reveals that any difference in the predicted and actual structure could be from experimental error in the experimental method — not the software . alternatively , an error could predict an alternative protein configuration that could occur due to natural variation . the global distance test the results are based on is a scale of 0 to 100 which dictates how close the ai predicted structure is to the actual shape of the protein as determined from experimental methods . alphafold was able to predict the structure of proteins with a margin of error of 1 . 6 angstroms ( 0 . 16 nanometers ) . this is equivalent to roughly the width of an atom . alphafold was able to accomplish the unthinkable . while scientists can determine the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein , there are thousands ( an understatement ) of ways that a protein can fold to achieve a three-dimensional shape . back in 1972 , christian anfinsen won the nobel prize in chemistry for proving that protein shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids . however , for the next 50 or so years , the scientific community had been grappling with trying to understand the shapes that proteins could fold into . according to deepmind , their latest version of alphafold used in the recent casp experiment was created using an attention-based neural network system . the system was trained end-to-end to be able to interpret the structure of a spacial graph which can be used to predict the shape of a folded protein . the system then goes on to reason over the implicit graph that it is building . alphafold “uses evolutionarily related sequences , multiple sequence alignment ( msa ) , and a representation of amino acid residue pairs to refine this graph . ” this iterative process allowed alphafold to develop solid predictions about the shape of a protein in as little as a few days . finally , an internal confidence method in alphafold is used to determine which parts of the predicted protein shape are reliable . alphafold’s ability to predict the shape of proteins has given new life to the study of diseases , something that has been thrust into the forefront of biology in the last year with a new urgency . deepmind’s technology could help virologists identify proteins that have become impaired to help understand how they interact in this new malfunctioning state . success in this field could lead to more precise drug development , further insight into existing experimental methods , and hopefully the realization of more efficient treatments for a variety of diseases and viruses . deepmind has even had the chance to use their ai in a real-world situation , having aided in early studies on the protein structures of the sars-cov-2 virus . alphafold was able to identify several related protein structures that had previously been unknown , helping scientists to better understand the nature of the virus . deepmind is currently in the process of preparing a paper concerning their system that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" DeepMind's Alford: A Groundbreaking Achievement in Protein Structure Prediction\n\nIn a remarkable breakthrough for the scientific community, DeepMind's Alford, an artificial intelligence system, has emerged as an exceptionally accurate solution to predict protein structures. This achievement comes three decades after the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASE) challenged the scientific community with the task of accurately predicting protein shapes. DeepMind, a company dedicated to developing AI systems for intelligent problem-solving and scientific advancements, collaborated with CASE to tackle biology's grand challenge.\n\nAlford, DeepMind's deep-learning system, has demonstrated its ability to predict protein structures with astonishing precision, down to the width of an atom. The system was trained using a vast database of approximately 170,000 protein structures. During rigorous testing, Alford achieved an impressive average score of 92.4 GDT (Global Distance Test) in its predictions, surpassing the competitive threshold score of 90 GDT. This means that Alford's capabilities are on par or even superior to experimental methods like cryo-electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and x-ray crystallography, which can take years to determine a protein's shape. In stark contrast, Alford can accomplish the task within a few days.\n\nObtaining a score over 90 indicates that any deviations between the predicted and actual protein structure might stem from experimental errors in the measurement techniques, rather than the software itself. Alternatively, an error could signify the prediction of an alternative protein configuration that could exist due to natural variation. The Global Distance Test, upon which these results are based, employs a scale of 0 to 100 to assess how closely the AI-predicted structure aligns with the actual shape derived from experimental methods. Alford achieved an astonishing margin of error of 1.6 angstroms (0.16 nanometers), which is roughly equivalent to the width of an atom.\n\nBy accomplishing the seemingly impossible, Alford is revolutionizing protein research. While scientists have long been able to determine the sequence of amino acids in a protein, understanding the myriad ways proteins can fold to achieve three-dimensional shapes has been a significant challenge for over five decades. DeepMind reveals that their latest version of Alford, employed in the recent CASE experiment, was built using an attention-based neural network system. This system was trained end-to-end to interpret the structure of a spatial graph, which serves as the basis for protein shape prediction. Subsequently, Alford reasons over the implicit graph it constructs, utilizing evolutionarily related sequences, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and a representation of amino acid residue pairs to refine its predictions. Through this iterative process, Alford can generate highly accurate protein shape predictions in just a matter of days.\n\nMoreover, Alford incorporates an internal confidence mechanism to assess the reliability of different parts of the predicted protein shape. This capability has breathed new life into the study of diseases, an area of research that has gained heightened urgency in the past year. DeepMind's technology could aid virologists in identifying impaired proteins, helping them understand how these proteins interact in a malfunctioning state. Success in this field may lead to more precise drug development, enhanced insights into existing experimental methods, and the development of more efficient treatments for various diseases and viruses. In fact, DeepMind has already contributed to real-world studies by assisting in the analysis of protein structures in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, identifying several previously unknown protein structures that have enriched our understanding of the virus.\n\nDeepMind is currently preparing a paper detailing their system, which will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. This significant accomplishment showcases the vast potential of Alford and sets a new standard in protein structure prediction, propelling the field of biomedical research into an exciting new era.

Perhaps it's your first story, or a notebook full of ideas from a writing residential you attended years ago but fell out with a classmate and dared not revisit. If you've already completed one story, I bet you have a stockpile, as the imagination has a tendency to spread like a weed, thriving in any conditions. Once you've opened that creative door, it becomes difficult to close—I can only imagine, as I've never attempted it myself. So, if you've been writing for a few years, attended various classes or workshops, then I presume you possess a stash of half-finished stories and ideas residing in your memory, desk drawer, or hard drive.\n\nBefore I delve into my 6-step process for unearthing the magic within your abandoned stories and getting them back on track, allow me to share an anecdote about a writer whose name is already well-known to us all. Yes, another Stephen King writing analogy, I'm afraid. However, this particular story emphasizes how effortlessly we discard ideas with tremendous potential, unrelated to the craftsmanship of writing itself. This tale revolves around \"Carrie,\" King's first published novel. After initially being inspired by the story, he wrote a three-page first draft and promptly discarded it, convinced he disliked it and that it was not worth any more of his time or effort. He believed it would never sell. Yet, his wife, curious about the crumpled pages protruding from his wastebasket, retrieved them, read the story, and loved it. She encouraged him to continue, eager to discover what would happen next. And so, he finished it—and the rest, as they say, is history. He published his debut novel, transcended imminent poverty, and forged a long and successful career.\n\nThe takeaway for aspiring authors who remain untapped or unpublished is as follows:\n- It is challenging to be objective about our own work.\n- It is easy to abandon a story.\n- Recognizing the gold amidst the fog of countless rejections is difficult.\n- Losing inspiration happens too easily.\n- It's particularly challenging to perceive the potential when starting out, the phase during which you're most likely to give up.\n\nMay this enduring optimism persist—my romantic view holds that the first draft of any story is a living, breathing entity, existing in the world. Let us embrace the role of treasure hunter ourselves. Who even uses a waste paper basket anymore? Here is my excavation process for seeking out the gems within the mountain of half-finished and forgotten stories amassed over the last seven years of your writing journey.\n\n1. Story hunting:\nPut on your gloves and start exploring your spaces. If you're lucky, you're all digital. My handwriting days have left me with a treasure chest of notebooks and pilfered A0 notepads. If this exercise is worth doing, it is worth doing correctly. My creative cellar contains a hard drive, old PC hard drives, notebooks, emails from course tutors, course notes in both physical and digital formats. In this phase, gather everything into one place. Do not worry about reading them just yet. This is a stock-take mode, and it already feels rewarding.\n\n2. Organizing:\nI recently realized, to my chagrin, that amidst the relentless pursuit of characters, living a Rimbaud existence, conducting research, and chasing inspiration, the organization of any project plays a crucial role in preventing the loss of our stories. It's time to record the following details: title, draft number, date, source of inspiration, favorite character, and the story's format. To accomplish this, you'll need a spreadsheet. It's an enjoyable process as you remember how much material you've accumulated and recall the adventures experienced along the way.\n\n3. Reading:\nThe thought of revisiting your old work may fill you with trepidation, but the upsides far outweigh the downsides, as you will soon discover. For every cringe-worthy moment you experience, you can also celebrate how much you have learned and grown as a writer. Most importantly, remember why you embarked on each project initially. Was it due to a person, an injustice, a character, or a response to another piece of literature? Rediscovering that spark of inspiration will undoubtedly compensate for any discomfort you may feel when confronted with your earlier amateur writing. As you peruse your work, make note of the parts you still appreciate. It could be a vivid description of a bluebell woods, an intriguing antagonist, or a brilliant line of dialogue. It is unlikely that you will fail to find something still breathing within each of your old stories.\n\n4. Repositioning:\nNow that you are reacquainted with your stories and have recalled their initial inspiration, consider if there is a better way to tell each tale. For instance, a stage play may be better suited as a film script or even a short story. Perhaps that television concept you began writing would flourish as a novel. With your refined storytelling skills, consider if there is a more suitable platform for each story. Remember, the options are limitless: flash fiction, microfiction, novella, novels, films, radio plays, stage plays, short films, web series, or a full series. A former playwriting tutor once imparted this wisdom—though it may seem obvious, I'll reiterate it here. Novels and short stories excel at exploring the conflicts within oneself, while the stage is best suited for delving into interpersonal conflicts. Meanwhile, film is ideal for capturing the conflicts between individuals and the world they inhabit. Pose a few repositioning questions: Is your story in its optimal format? Is your main character dynamic, or is there another character who could take the protagonist's place? As a tutor once remarked during a workshop, the scripts he encountered often featured characters to whom situations were imposed, rather than characters who created their own circumstances.\n\n5. Big Picture:\nNow that you have made alterations or confirmed the direction for your story, consider how you will navigate towards your desired destination. What extraordinary events could transform this story into something astonishing? Approach this task just as you would when crafting actions for your characters—think big. Try the \"+10 rule.\" If you lost interest in the idea the first time around, now is the opportunity to take it to an even grander scale. Identify the actions required to make this vision a reality. List everything—whether it means tidying up your workspace, completing existing projects to free up time, adopting a healthier diet, or removing any negative influences from your life. Eliminate all obstacles that stand in the way of you and your story's grander purpose.\n\n6. Action Plan:\nThe action plan is the simplest step of all. You possess a vision; now add a deadline, set milestones, and outline the small steps needed to complete your task. For instance, find a suitable publishing platform or reach out to a supportive friend via a pleasant email, requesting their feedback on your story—let's think meta! If you are working on a screenplay, the process remains the same. Program your plan into a spreadsheet, utilizing a column or reporting function to track your progress as you move forward.\n\n END"}

It humorously describes the different tribes and their specific areas of expertise. However, in order to present the information in a professional tone, we will need to rephrase and eliminate the informal language and humorous remarks.\n\nThe field of neuroscience encompasses various subspecies, each with their own expertise and research focus. One prominent subspecies is the electrophysiologist, responsible for recording single neurons and implanting electrodes. Notable tribes within this subspecies include the patch-clampers, who attach micrometer-scale glass pieces to neurons smaller than a human hair. Some individuals within this tribe even attempt the same procedures on awake, moving animals. However, difficulties in their research often lead to frustration.\n\nAnother subspecies is the systems' neuroscientist, distinguishable from electrophysiologists by their attempt to record from multiple neurons simultaneously and relate their findings to the external world. Systems neuroscientists are further categorized into various tribes based on their research interests. These tribes include sensory obsessives, memoirists, revisionists, motor waggles, and others that identify themselves based on specific brain regions or types of brains they study.\n\nCognitive neuroscientists focus primarily on understanding the human brain. This subspecies is further divided into breeds, although there is some overlap between them. Neuroimaging, often referred to as \"psychologists with magnets,\" utilize colorful imaging techniques and rituals such as referencing \"conferring\" or expressing concern upon hearing \"dead salmon.\" Scalp ticklers, who utilize hairnets as part of their research, are often identified by their distinct calls. A further breed, known as magnetizers, combines psychological approaches with quantum methodologies.\n\nNeuroanatomists were once thought to be declining, but the advent of connectors revitalized this subspecies, resulting in the emergence of new and previously unrecorded phenotypes. Neural engineers view the brain as a feedback loop and manipulate amplifier settings to eliminate unwanted noise. Behavioral neuroscientists attempt to infer brain processes through observation of rodent behavior, often described using capital letters. Neurobiologists, on the other hand, study animal behavior to understand brain function and have minimal interaction with behavioral neuroscientists.\n\nNeuroendocrinologists are particularly interested in the influence of hormonal activity on brain cells. They study the effects of various substances beyond neurotransmitters and often jest about raster plots, a type of graph favored by Bob Marley fans. Molecular neuroscientists employ methodologies typically associated with molecular biologists, focusing on proteins and chemical signaling within cells. However, they sometimes struggle to differentiate brain cells from other cell types. Neurogeneticists focus on the expression of DNA and RNA in brain cells, often drawing comparisons to yeast.\n\nClinical neuroscientists interact most with Homo sapiens, utilizing their skills to diagnose and treat individuals with brain disorders. This subspecies is often characterized by their professional attire. Computational neuroscientists, often introverted and preferring solitude, draw expertise from various disciplines such as physics, mathematics, and computer science. However, their diverse backgrounds can lead to difficulties in effective communication.\n\nWithin the subspecies of computational neuroscientists, there are distinct breeds. Circuit modelers construct scaled models of specific brain regions but face criticisms from systems neuroscientists for their precision and lack of broader applicability. Algorithmic, meanwhile, search for step-by-step instructions that govern brain function. For the past 25 years, they have focused on deep-lying neurons and their potential involvement in dopamine signaling. Compartmentalizes employ numerous equations to describe single neurons, often lacking experimental data for parameter determination. Bayesian, using Bayesian statistics, apply a unified framework to analyze various phenomena in neuroscience. Karl Frisson, a prominent figure in the field, defies classification due to his unique contributions.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of neuroscience consists of numerous subspecies, each with their own distinct research interests and methodologies. While they may differ in their approaches, they collectively contribute to our understanding of the brain and its complexities. END"}

Time management is a challenging endeavor that requires utmost efficiency. While it is true that there are only 24 hours in a day, the common belief that one should maximize productivity during every single hour overlooks the limitations of time. Engaging in effective time management can sometimes feel like extracting blood from a stone.\n\n2. As we progress into the future, the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation on the job market is becoming increasingly significant. Renowned expert Knife Lee predicts that within the next few decades, approximately forty to fifty percent of jobs will be taken over by AI. However, it is important to note that not all occupations will be equally affected by this shift. Jobs that rely heavily on creativity will remain beyond the reach of AI, ushering in what some have called the \"creative age.\"\n\n3. Recent research conducted by neuroscientists John Units and Mark Bee man has shed light on the distinct nature of creative thinking. Their work reveals that creative thinking is a unique cognitive process, influenced by factors such as positive mood and relaxation. The state of creativity is delicate and elusive, characterized by difficulty in attaining and ease in losing. The following animation by Units and Bee man illustrates the moment of insight in the brain.\n\n4. Surprisingly, studies indicate that our off-peak times of the day are when our creativity is at its peak. Contradicting common intuition, research suggests that being groggy in the morning can actually be a catalyst for creative thinking. Instead of reaching for a cup of coffee immediately, embracing this grogginess may uncover unexpected creative gifts.\n\n5. It is crucial to recognize that a great idea does not automatically translate into a finalized product. The creative process involves four distinct stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Each stage requires dedicated attention and should not be neglected. Respecting and understanding these stages ensures that one does not become blocked in the creative process.\n\n6. Every hour of the day does not hold the same potential for creative thinking or execution. Research conducted by Dan Ariel and corroborated by my observations during the development of Timeout (acquired by Google) demonstrates that different hours of the day favor various types of thinking. Andes Ericsson, a renowned violinist, observed that intense practice is most effective during the morning, while sporadic practice yields better results during the remaining hours of the day.\n\n7. The world operates in cycles, and harnessing these cycles can propel our ideas forward. Days, weeks, seasons, and years can be utilized in a cyclical manner to navigate through the four stages of creativity. Embracing a night's rest, a rejuvenating weekend, or a reflective winter can serve as valuable incubation periods for our creative endeavors. END"}

Becoming a trusted guide whom people turn to for the latest and best insights in your industry is an invaluable asset. Guest posting offers a fantastic opportunity to boost your message and achieve this status. However, when approaching influencers, you might question whether you have what it takes to capture the attention of the biggest blogger you know. Let me assure you that it doesn't matter who you are; if you have a great idea for a post that will benefit the influencer and their audience, they will be delighted to hear it.\n\nTo maximize your chances of success, your pitch should be original, inspiring, and useful. Avoid the common mistake of making your pitch all about yourself and your needs. Rather, focus on the influencer's agenda by understanding their blog's mission, writing style, and the contributions of other voices in the conversation. This knowledge will greatly enhance the quality of your pitch. Keep in mind that writing for the influencer is a privilege, not a right bestowed upon you. Appreciate this fact, and your chances of securing a guest spot will greatly increase.\n\nWhen reaching out to influencers, employ a template that ensures your pitch is concise, friendly, and direct. Remember that influencers are busy individuals, often with assistants who read their emails. To stand out from the crowd, adhere to the guidelines provided by the blogger, as they typically outline topics, post length, and writing style preferences. While there may be room to deviate from some rules when writing, this should not apply to the guidelines. By satisfying the criteria and offering something exceptional, you will significantly increase your chances of being considered for a guest post opportunity.\n\nA proven template for a successful pitch involves keeping it short, ideally containing a maximum of three paragraphs and no more than 5-6 sentences in total. In the first line, provide a specific compliment related to the influencer's work. For example, you can mention how their recent post on breaking bad habits was transformative for you, as it helped you quit smoking after being hooked for three decades.

Ensure your proposal is clear and easily understood with a quick glance. Finally, in the third line, express your appreciation and gratitude while leaving the invitation open for further communication.\n\nIn the event that your pitch is not accepted, don't be discouraged. Research the blog extensively, studying both recent and archived posts, as well as the influencer's activity on social media platforms like Twitter. This research will provide valuable insights into the influencer's preferences and desires, enabling you to tailor future pitches to their specific needs. Remember, making the influencer feel important is the best way to establish a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nYour next step is to identify the leading blog in your niche and offer to write a piece that aligns with their mission. Once you receive a positive response, please share your experience with me. If you've previously guest posted, I would be interested to learn about the strategies you employed to secure those opportunities. By uplifting an influencer's audience, you will, in turn, elevate your own, creating long-term growth and exposure for your work. END"}
{"prompt":"amazon , google and apple recently enabled their products to “listen” for these 3 reasons iphone , apple watch and pixel buds- what you can do with their new sound detection features humans are born to detect threats by staying alert to sounds . we get nervous when we hear footsteps walking behind us in a dark street . we are all ears and alert when we are about to go to bed and hear something outside the bedroom . with limited sight at night , or at home alone , we often depend solely on sounds to understand the surroundings . but what about when we are distracted ? can you hear the door knock when you are listening to music wearing big headphones ? or how do i know the car behind me honked to warn me of approaching with my noise cancelling mode on ? what about for those who have hearing loss ? what if i want to know if my dog barks and upset my neighbors while i’m away ? big tech companies have come up with solutions to these problems thanks to the recent breakthroughs with sound ai technology — and now they are able to build these machine learning-based sound detection features into their devices as small as earbuds . starting from 2019 , amazon , google and apple have competitively released sound detection features , mainly for these three purposes . #1 . home security smart speakers can listen for suspicious activities while you are away in may 2019 , amazon rolled out alexa guard , enabling amazon echo speakers to transition into guard mode by saying a command like “alexa , i’m leaving” . if sounds like glass break , co alarm or human activity including footfalls or door opening is detected , it will send a notification to your phone . you can also configure it to lock any doors with compatible smart locks , or deter unwanted visitors by turning on\/off lights to make it appear as if you’re home , sound dog barking sound or a siren when activity is detected . similarly , in november 2019 , google released glass break detection for its smart speaker , nest secure . in fact , sound recognition technology applied to home security is not a brand-new concept . prior to the deep-learning based sound detection method like the example of alexa guard , a rule-based sound detection method had been used conventionally , which basically recognizes sound by loudness and magnitude of frequency . traditional glass break detectors or smoke alarm detectors are built with this rule-based technology . “rule-based” system , as its name implies , is confined by knowledge and rules given manually by human . as a result , it was not useful for complex environment where there were high frequency of exceptional patterns and thus , had poor performance . modern deep-learning based models on the other hand , doesn’t depend on given knowledge because it can continue learning on its own , constantly optimizing itself by adapting to changes and hidden patterns , resulting in incomparably better performance compared to the rule-based one . #2 . safety your wearable will make sure you don’t miss a thing ! smartphone manufacturers are constantly producing wearable and accessories to upsell with their smartphones . among them , wireless earbuds , since the launch of airpods 1 , have been a huge hit , and report says apple alone has sold nearly 60 million airpods . airpods users love the noise cancelling function , introduced with airpods pro , “cancels” the external sound before it could make you feel as if you are isolated from outside world . while it’s a cool function , noise cancelling presents high risk of accidents by nature . if you are a cyclist or drive frequently , chances are you have encountered a passenger with earbuds who’s totally unaware of your bicycle bells or car honks . some states in the us have introduced laws to forbid drivers to wear headphones or earbuds while driving . aware of this danger earbuds could bring , earbuds makers have been devising ways to avoid this danger . google’s pixel buds have brought attention alerts in august 2020 . if a baby cries nearby or an emergency vehicle passes by with its siren on , the pixel buds will automatically lower the volume temporarily so you can hear what’s happening around you . additionally , apple watch added another creative and well-timed safety measure amid the pandemic — the hand washing timer . with this feature enabled , apple watch listens for water running sound , and will automatically display 20 seconds countdown for proper hand washing . #3 . accessibility designed to assist with your daily lives hearing loss is a common problem caused by noise , aging , disease , and heredity . globally , there are 466-million people suffering from some level of hearing loss . hearing loss hugely impacts daily life in many ways . take for example , sounds they are likely to miss out due to hearing loss — when you forget to turn off the water faucet , you can’t hear the constantly running water . no beep from the oven telling you your food is ready . can’t tell if the smoke alarm went off . missing out their babies crying , murmuring , and giggling… all these are huge pain they have to live with . these people could hugely benefit from the sound detection technology if their mobile devices could capture the sound for them and give them notifications . apple and google were the first to add this feature into their smartphones , and users can configure sounds they want to detect under accessibility setting — ios 14 sound recognition ( updated in september 2020 ) and android sound notifications ( updated in october 2020 ) respectively . ios users can set their devices to constantly listen for 11 sounds and receive alerts when these sounds are detected . the sounds are categorized as follows •alarms fire , siren , smoke •animals cat , dog •household appliances , car horn , door bell , door knock , water running •people baby crying android users can likewise detect 11 sounds including shouting and landline phone ringing . tech companies see accessibility as one of its core values and they put in a ton of work in assistive technology in order to ensure everyone can use their devices in the best ways to suit them . some accessibility features such as voiceover ( screen reader ) or voice control , originally designed and developed with accessibility in mind , were adopted by mainstream after many people found value in these features . sound detection too , will turn out to be useful for many people in general if smartphones could recognize diverse sounds and help them understand their surroundings better . progressing towards a smarter future as it’s a growing market in the early stage , tech giants saw huge potential in the sound ai technology and started in investing in the field . world’s largest annual workshop in the sound ai research field , ieee dcase ( workshop on detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events ) , which used to be a flagship event mainly for academia , recently gained faang’s attention . in 2019 , facebook , amazon , google , and ibm sponsored dcase , and apple joined in the following year . predominant application for sound ai technology until now would be a simple sound recognition , like what apple , google and amazon has built so far . what’s bound to come in the next few years however , is much more than that . researchers have spent a great deal of time studying how electronic devices can be augmented with sensors that allow them to perceive their environment . this body of work , often referred to as context-aware , stems from the idea that in order to build large-scale ubiquitous systems , individual devices must be aware of their environment ( e . g . where they are , what is happening , where something is happening ) . based on such information , applications and devices can make decisions proactively . sounds provide countless contextual information . imagine what it would be like if devices could process perceive their surroundings by sound . your cars could tell whether you are passing by a highway or crowded street , or forest surrounded by birds chirping , and change driving mode accordingly . security cameras catch violent noise and spot a crime . smart lamps knows you fell asleep and turn off the light . autonomous car , smart city , home automation and healthcare — expansion of context-aware sound applications could be exponential . with the speed of the research advancement in the field , context-aware sound applications will boom in the very near future . so let’s tune in and see what’s coming !\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Amazon, Google, and Apple have recently implemented sound detection features in their products to enhance user experiences and address specific needs. Humans are naturally attuned to sounds as a way to detect potential threats and understand their surroundings. However, there are instances where distractions can hinder our ability to hear important sounds, such as a knock on the door while wearing headphones or missing a car honk while using noise-canceling mode. Additionally, individuals with hearing loss may struggle to hear important sounds in their environment, such as a barking dog or a smoke alarm.\n\nTo address these challenges, technology giants like Amazon, Google, and Apple have developed sound detection features for various purposes. The first major application is home security, where smart speakers like Amazon Echo can listen for suspicious activities when the user is away. These devices can detect sounds like glass breaking, CO alarms, or human activity and send notifications to the user's phone. They can also be configured to lock doors with compatible smart locks or create the illusion of someone being home by turning lights on and off or playing dog barking sounds or sirens.\n\nThe introduction of sound detection features in home security is not entirely new, as previous versions relied on rule-based methods that recognized sounds based on loudness and frequency levels. However, the recent breakthroughs in deep-learning based sound recognition technology have significantly enhanced the performance of these features, allowing them to adapt to changes and hidden patterns in complex environments.\n\nThe second application of sound detection features is safety. Smartphone manufacturers, like Apple, have produced wearable accessories like wireless earbuds, which have gained immense popularity. While these earbuds feature noise-canceling capabilities, they also present risks as users may be oblivious to their surroundings, including important sounds like bicycle bells or car honks. To mitigate this danger, Google's Pixel Buds introduced attention alerts, which temporarily lower the volume when a baby cries nearby or an emergency vehicle passes with sirens on. Apple Watch has also implemented a timely safety measure amid the pandemic by listening for the sound of running water to prompt users to engage in proper handwashing.\n\nThe third application focuses on accessibility. Hearing loss affects millions of people worldwide, impacting their daily lives in various ways. Sounds that they might miss out on due to their condition, such as running water or oven timers, can significantly disrupt their routines. To address this, companies like Apple and Google have integrated sound detection features into their smartphones. Users can configure their devices to listen for specific sounds, such as alarms, animal noises, household appliances, and even people's voices. These features provide notifications when these sounds are detected, ensuring individuals with hearing loss don't miss important cues in their environment.\n\nTech companies prioritize accessibility as a core value and invest significant effort in developing assistive technologies to ensure all users can optimize their device usage. Some features, like voice over and voice control, initially designed for accessibility purposes, have gained mainstream adoption due to their value to a wider audience. Sound detection is expected to follow a similar path, becoming useful for many people as smartphones become capable of recognizing and interpreting diverse sounds, aiding in better understanding of one's surroundings.\n\nRecognizing the immense potential of sound AI technology, tech giants have started investing heavily in this field. For instance, they have sponsored events like IEEE CASE, the largest annual workshop in the sound AI research field, which aims to advance the detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events. The future of sound AI technology extends beyond simple sound recognition, with researchers exploring ways to enable devices to perceive their environment through sound. This context-aware approach can lead to numerous applications, such as cars adjusting driving modes based on surrounding sounds, security cameras detecting violent noise, or smart lamps responding to sleeping patterns. The expansion of context-aware sound applications in areas like autonomous cars, smart cities, home automation, and healthcare is expected to grow exponentially with further advancements in research.\n\nIn conclusion, Amazon, Google, and Apple have integrated sound detection features into their products to enhance home security, safety, and accessibility. These technologies have the potential to transform how our devices interpret and respond to sounds, leading to a future where context-aware applications significantly impact various aspects of our lives.

{"prompt":"ew things affect our productivity as much as what we surround ourselves with . yet most of us rarely take the time to step back and really analyze our working environment . instead , we take a ‘set it and forget it’ approach to where we work . we go to the same office , the same coffee shop , the same co-working space and try to force ourselves into a productive flow . since going remote a year and a half ago while working at crew i’ve fallen into this mindset more times than i’d like to admit . so i started to ask if we’re going to spend so much of our lives working , why not try to make the place we work the best it possibly can be ? whether you’re at home , in a shared space , or hanging out a coffee shop there are quick and easy fixes to help make your work space work for you . why our environment matters ( even when we don’t notice ) you may think that you’ve got a good set up , but read into the ways that our surroundings affect us on a subconscious level and you’ll start to feel pretty uneasy about your environment . studies have shown how our working habits , both good and bad , are often related to some sort of external trigger or cue , which researchers are increasingly tying to our surroundings . we visit the same places , work at the same desk , and are constantly surrounded by the same influencing factors . which is great , right ? find a good working environment and you’ll be forced into a state of flow . but unfortunately , like most things to do with how our brains work , there’s so much more beneath the surface . as we evolved , our subconscious brain has been trained to keep us safe , even when we don’t realize it . when we’re under threat we need to make decisions quickly , which our brain does through something called ‘thin slicing’ . this means it takes one small element of reality and generalizes it , and from that it will determine what behavior to adopt . so those triggers and cues in your workspace aren’t just affecting you in a way you can consciously comprehend , they’re changing the way your subconscious brain thinks and acts . don’t believe me ? here’s some studies that show just how ridiculously powerful our environment is in changing the way we think and act students holding a hot cup of coffee for a few seconds before being asked to judge a hypothetical person , were more likely to describe them as warm and friendly than those holding an iced coffee people will behave more competitively if there’s a briefcase in sight — or even if there’s a picture of a briefcase on the wall . and this happens even when people have no conscious memory of having seen the briefcase afterwards . if you talk to someone who consistently uses words like down , depressed , low , pointless , and disappointed you’re likely to feel the same way even the subtle aroma of cleaning liquid in the air causes people to be perceptibly cleaner and tidier than usual so how do we create an environment that’s optimal for making us feel the way we want to during the working day motivated , productive , and creative ? kill the clutter before it kills you there is a long history of creatives and thinkers with cluttered desks . as albert einstein once so eloquently put it “if a cluttered desk signs a cluttered mind , of what , then , is an empty desk a sign ? ” however , whether it’s your closet or office desk , excess things in your surroundings can have a negative impact on your ability to focus and process information . that’s exactly what neuroscientists at princeton university found when they looked at people’s task performance in an organized versus disorganized environment . the results of the study showed that physical clutter in your surroundings competes for your attention , resulting in decreased performance and increased stress . a team of ucla researchers recently observed 32 los angeles families and found that all of the mothers’ stress hormones spiked during the time they spent dealing with their belongings . similar to what multitasking does to your brain , physical clutter overloads your senses , making you feel stressed , and impairs your ability to think creatively . however , it’s not as easy as just getting rid of the excess things in your life . we don’t create clutter simply through laziness or being unorganized , it literally hurts your brain to give them up . researchers at yale recently identified that two areas in your brain associated with pain , the anterior cingulate cortex and insula , light up in response to letting go of items you own and feel a connection towards this is the same area of the brain that lights up when you feel physical pain from a paper cut or drinking coffee that’s too hot . your brain views the loss of one of your valued possessions the same as something that causes you physical pain . so what do we do to reduce the stress of clutter ? apply constraints whether that’s twitter followers , tabs open in your browser , notebooks , or magazines , setting hard limitations and sticking to them is the best way to stop accumulating more . whether that’s twitter followers , tabs open in your browser , notebooks , or magazines , setting hard limitations and sticking to them is the best way to stop accumulating more . use small storage spaces parkinson’s law says we fill the time we have available to us , and the same could be said about clutter . less room means less room for clutter . parkinson’s law says we fill the time we have available to us , and the same could be said about clutter . less room means less room for clutter . conduct a monthly review of your space set time aside to clean , sort , and discard every single month . set time aside to clean , sort , and discard every single month . set up a daily cleanse routine crew ceo mikael suggests cleaning your desktop at the end of every workday so to-do items don’t linger and you’ve got a clean slate to start with the next day find places that inspire you there’s a reason we feel inspired by large spaces or refreshed from sitting by the window . apart from a heavy dose of vitamin d , architecture can have a huge impact on our productivity . author james clear gives the example of researcher jonas salk , who , after spending years trying to discover the cure for the polio epidemic ravaging the us in the 50s , travelled to the quiet hills of central italy where he stayed at a 13th-century franciscan monastery known as the basilica of san francesco d’assisi . the space changed the way he thought “the spirituality of the architecture there was so inspiring that i was able to do intuitive thinking far beyond any i had done in the past . under the influence of that historic place i intuitively designed the research that i felt would result in a vaccine for polio . i returned to my laboratory in pittsburgh to validate my concepts and found that they were correct . ” jonas’ example is just one of many . it’s been long known that schools with more natural light provide a better learning environment for students and test scores often go up as a result . and natural light and fresh air are known to stimulate productivity in the workplace as well . you might not be in a position to choose your workspace , but there are quick fixes look for a spot with natural light from a window or skylight take a walk outside when you feel stuck or simply explore a new location . a new environment can quite literally lead to new ideas . and what’s even more exciting is that studies have shown it’s actually easier to build new habits in new places . use different places for different places of mind we know that different locations will affect us , so why not use that to our advantage ? our brains love habits , and if we can associate certain qualities with different places , it can help us get into a better working flow . this is called ‘task association’ , where your brain knows that when you’re in a certain place , you’re taking a certain action . writer gregory ciotti gives one great example of how he forces himself into a better working flow just by changing the device he’s using . in his example , he’s trained his brain to know that when he’s at his desktop it’s time for deep writing like articles . the laptop is for more shallow work like emails or informal posts . and lastly , the tablet is for reading only . this technique is so powerful it’s even been used to help treat people with insomnia by telling them to only go into their bedroom if they’re actually tired . if sleep isn’t achieved in a reasonable amount of time , they were instructed to leave and move onto another task until they were tired again . if you can set up multiple workspaces for different tasks you’ll also be able to force your mind into a certain flow , just by physically being somewhere . a great example of this is writer and artist austin kleon who keeps two desks setup in his space an ‘analog’ desk filled with paper , pens , and markers and a ‘digital’ desk with laptop and tablet . idea creation and ‘playing’ takes place on only the analog desk , while shaping , editing , and publishing is in the digital domain . set yourself up for success we may think we have the willpower and control to push through harder tasks , but deep down we’re all lazy . but it’s not entirely our fault . our brains have been taught to conserve energy at all costs and make subconscious decisions for us based entirely on how hard or easy it is . so if you want to create a workspace that’s productive , focus on making it easier to do the things you want to do , and harder to do the tasks you don’t . stanford professor and psychologist bj fogg calls this ‘designing for laziness’ . sometimes it’s as easy as turning your phone off and putting it in a drawer so every time you’re tempted to check it you have to go through a lengthy process , while other times it might mean unplugging your tv and putting it in the closet . one technique i’ve used lately is to close all of my tabs in my browser at the end of the day ( a hellish chore for any writer ) , leaving only my most important task open . the next day , the easiest choice is just to keep working on whatever was left from the day before . i’m certainly not the first person to use this technique . even hemingway used to stop writing mid-sentence so that he always knew where to pick up the next day . curate your senses beyond the physical layout and mental associations of your space , there are some auxiliary things you can also control . the sounds around you and the music you listen to can have a huge impact on your productivity . we’ve written about the power of music and how to find the right track for the right task before , but it’s important to note that certain sounds can be incredibly harmful to how you work . studies show that of all things , intermittent speech — hearing small snippets of conversation — can have an incredibly negative impact on your ability to concentrate . one meta-analysis examined 242 studies of the ways noise affects performance , and found that when it came to performing cognitive tasks — like staying attentive , reading and processing text , and working with numbers — performance was more affected by intermittent speech than by either continuous speech ( which would have little variation in volume and rhythm ) or non-speech noise . bad news for those of us in shared spaces or offices . there are options though . if you can’t find a spot that’s silent , noise cancelling headphones or music that drowns out speech can help regain that focus .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Few things impact our productivity as much as the environment we work in. Unfortunately, most of us don't take the time to analyze our working surroundings and instead adopt a \"set it and forget it\" approach. Whether we're in a traditional office, a coffee shop, or a co-working space, there are simple fixes to make our workspaces more conducive to productivity.\n\nOur environment plays a significant role in influencing our subconscious brain. Studies have shown that our working habits, both positive and negative, are often connected to external triggers or cues present in our surroundings. These triggers shape the way our subconscious brain thinks and acts, even without our conscious awareness.\n\nFor example, researchers found that holding a hot cup of coffee made people judge others as warm and friendly, while the presence of a briefcase influenced individuals to behave more competitively. Even the subtle aroma of cleaning liquid can make individuals appear cleaner and tidier than usual.\n\nTo create an optimal work environment that promotes motivation, productivity, and creativity, it's essential to address clutter. While some may argue that a cluttered desk is a sign of a creative mind, research suggests that excess items can hinder our ability to focus and process information. Physical clutter competes for our attention, resulting in decreased performance and increased stress.\n\nHowever, decluttering isn't as straightforward as getting rid of things. It can be challenging because our brain views the loss of possessions we value as a form of pain. To reduce the stress of clutter, it's helpful to apply constraints, use small storage spaces, conduct monthly reviews, and establish a daily cleanse routine.\n\nIn addition to decluttering, finding places that inspire us can significantly impact productivity. Natural light and fresh air stimulate productivity, so if possible, choose a workspace with access to these elements. Exploring new locations or taking a walk outside can also lead to new ideas and make it easier to build new habits.\n\nTask association, where our brain associates certain qualities with different places, can help us get into a better working flow. By setting up multiple workspaces for different tasks, we can leverage this concept to our advantage. For instance, using a specific device for each type of work can train our brain to transition smoothly between tasks.\n\nDesigning our work environment to make desired tasks easier and unwanted tasks more challenging can boost productivity. Creating barriers, such as turning off and storing distractions like smartphones and TVs, forces us to make a deliberate effort to engage in these tasks.\n\nLastly, curating our senses can also enhance productivity. The surrounding sounds, including intermittent speech, can impact concentration. Using noise-canceling headphones or playing music that drowns out speech can help regain focus in shared workspaces.\n\nIn summary, optimizing our work environment is crucial for productivity. By decluttering, finding inspiring spaces, leveraging task association, designing for laziness, and curating our senses, we can create a workspace that promotes motivation, productivity, and creativity.

Firstly, immerse yourself in extensive reading material. By delving into diverse literary works, you can gain valuable insights and knowledge. Secondly, based on what you have absorbed, engage in the act of writing itself. When it comes to formatting a novel, for instance, I suggest studying the formatting techniques utilized by established authors as a reference point. For instance, peruse various novels and carefully observe whether paragraph breaks are employed each time a new character begins speaking. In all likelihood, you will discover that a majority of them do follow this convention, making it a sound practice to adopt.\n\nWhen it comes to crafting an exceptional starship captain character, an instructive approach would be to watch popular science fiction series such as Star Trek: The Next Generation on Netflix. By closely observing the portrayal of captains, particularly the iconic Jean-Luc Picard and Kathryn Jane way, you can glean valuable insights and inspirations. Incorporating traits from these revered characters, as well as drawing upon qualities from individuals you personally admire, can contribute to the development of a unique and captivating captain character. Moreover, through their interactions with the challenges presented in your story, you can effectively bring this character to life. Thus, it is essential to invest time in observing the world around you, reading well-crafted literature, and immersing yourself in captivating movies and TV shows – particularly those that contain gripping and intense scenes.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that as you commence your writing journey, your initial attempts may be less than perfect. Yet, through continued reading, watching, and learning, you can witness substantial growth and development as a writer. Seeking guidance and knowledge by enrolling in writing classes or soliciting help from published authors can also be beneficial. In fact, I can personally attest to the value of the supportive notes I received from author Heather Petty, who provided invaluable feedback on my own debut novel. However, none of this progress can occur until you take that first step and actually begin writing. Therefore, it is imperative to set aside external distractions, such as frequently consulting platforms like Quora, and restrain the impulse to excessively question yourself. Although it may be challenging, and despite the desire to achieve perfection from the outset, it is crucial to procrastinate on these uncertainties. Instead, focus on making progress, completing your work, and refining it through subsequent revisions. Embrace the process of writing and allow yourself to grow, both as a writer and as an individual. END"}

Here are five key benefits that highlight why adding images to your blog posts is crucial:\n\n1. Enhanced Visual Appeal: Incorporating pictures into your posts is an excellent way to create a positive first impression. If your post lacks visual appeal and fails to evoke emotions, many visitors may leave your website without even reading a word. By incorporating visually attractive images, you increase the chances of forging an emotional connection with your readers. Such posts appear friendlier and more inviting, encouraging readers to take action. Additionally, adding images helps create a visual narrative for your blog, enabling readers to engage further. As a result, they are more likely to retain information.\n\n2. Increased Social Media Sharing: Social media marketing plays a pivotal role in raising awareness about your content and driving traffic to your business blog and website. Studies show that blog articles containing images receive 94% more views, while tweets with images are retweeted 150% more. Furthermore, Facebook posts accompanied by images receive three times more engagement. Incorporating images into your blog posts significantly improves their shareability on social media platforms, ultimately driving more traffic to your website.\n\n3. Showcase Additional Skills: With the rising number of bloggers, it is essential to distinguish yourself from others by showcasing additional skills. Learning simple design tasks and creating custom illustrations for your posts can enhance your blogging skills and provide an opportunity to practice. By building a portfolio of your artwork samples, readers may recognize your hands-on designing experience, leading to the perception of you as a higher-profile blogger. If you offer blogging services, customers will appreciate the added value of someone who can create custom images alongside compelling writing.\n\n4. Enhance Readability: Similar to how paragraphs break up text and make it easier to comprehend, images serve as visual breaks that improve textual clarity. When faced with a dense wall of text, readers are inclined to seek alternative sources. Even if your content isn't as lengthy as others, if it appears challenging to read, readers may lose interest. Comparatively, blog posts that incorporate images are infinitely more engaging and comprehensible. By strategically placing images within your text, you enable readers to better understand and digest the information you share.\n\n5. SEO Optimization: Blog posts accompanied by relevant images are more likely to perform better in search engine rankings. An additional benefit of utilizing images is the ability to add alt text within your content management system. Alt text, which readers are unable to see but search engines crawl, can significantly impact your SEO efforts. By incorporating primary keywords into your alt text and adhering to keyword best practices, you enhance your blog's visibility within search engines. It is important to optimize your images by compressing and resizing them for faster loading and improved search engine performance.\n\nIncorporating images into your blog posts offers numerous advantages, ranging from improving visual appeal and increasing social media sharing to showcasing additional skills, enhancing readability, and optimizing your blog for search engines. By utilizing images effectively, you can create more engaging and professional blog content. END"}

she still loves meg cabot . and you know what else ? i still love meg cabot . she made my daughter a reader on a whole other level . that one little follow garnered her two deeper connections with readers than she would have otherwise had . that was long before i had any published books , but i realized then that i wanted to make people feel the way meg cabot made my daughter feel that day . so , what does it all mean ? i think it means , for writers , that you can read all the advice and strategy guides and tip listicles there are — and none if it will really matter if you’re not making a connection . you don’t necessarily need to make a personal , one-on-one connection with every reader . i mean , you’re only one person . but you can remember that your readers are people who have chosen to spend their free time with you . you can throw away the adages about how many people you should follow . you can pay attention to your readers , so that your work becomes a conversation with them , instead of you pontificating and getting upset when no one listens . when i think about sticky novelists , i think about meg cabot following my kid on twitter . and chuck palahniuk teaching me about thought verbs . and stephen king’s letters to his constant readers . i think about ellen hopkins traveling all year long to schools to meet her young readers . i also think about ray bradbury and octavia butler and judy blume and a hundred other authors who told stories that invited me in . and that’s harder to do , of course . way harder than following someone on twitter . but it’s what i meant about being in conversation with your reader . it wasn’t the first impression that mattered to me the most for any of those writers . i don’t remember which judy blume book i read first . freckle juice , maybe . but i will never forget reading tiger eyes when it was brand new in 1981 . it was the first time i ever read anything that made me think — oh , my god , this author knows me . i was ten years old . i’ve bought all of blume’s books for my children . i’ve shared them with young friends my entire adult life . my daughters and i stood in line for hours to meet her at a book event and it was worth every minute . she made a sticky impression on me in the sixth grade .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The importance of first impressions cannot be understated. As Malcolm Gladwell aptly stated, we often underestimate their fragility and fail to fully grasp their significance. While there is no shortage of advice on how to make a strong first impression as a writer – from proper formatting to captivating content – we must also consider what comes after that initial encounter.\n\nIn many cases, first impressions are either transparent or slick. Readers may not remember their initial impression of a writer, or even if they do, it may not have a lasting impact if it is challenged later on. Therefore, the true measure of success lies in the second impression – the opportunity to forge a durable connection and leave a lasting impression.\n\nAllow me to share a personal experience that exemplifies this concept. There is an author whom I deeply admire. I subscribe to his newsletter, own all his books, and have promoted his work tirelessly. Naturally, my first impression of him was positive, polished, and enticing. A couple of years ago, while in the same city as him, I took the opportunity to introduce myself and propose a meeting over coffee. His polite decline did not shatter my perception of him. However, when I later reached out to him to share my success in selling over 100 copies of his books and request an interview, receiving the same generic response diminished the shine of that initial impression. Though intellectually I understood his reasons, emotionally, the tarnish remained.\n\nThis experience highlights the transformative power of the second impression. It signifies a chance to create a lasting bond with followers who have become genuine fans. As writers, managing these connections is of utmost importance. I, for one, was initially a devoted fan of this author's work, going above and beyond to promote it. However, after encountering the second impression, my enthusiasm waned, and I became a regular fan rather than a superfan.\n\nAnother illustrative example revolves around a program I eagerly enrolled in. The first impression was visually appealing, slick, and promising. However, early on, complications arose when the program owner abruptly changed platforms, severely hampering interactivity. While my initial impression was tainted, a one-minute personalized video email from one of the program's administrators revitalized my enthusiasm. It made me feel valued and connected, assuaging my concerns about the platform switch. Although the program ultimately faltered, that thoughtful engagement left a lasting imprint, prompting me to explore future offerings from the developer.\n\nThis concept applies not only to writers but to all forms of marketing. The first impression is undoubtedly essential, creating a solid foundation and piquing interest. However, it is the second impression that truly determines the success of the marketing endeavor. Readers who are enticed enough to seek out additional content or engage in conversation are the ones who desire a sticky experience. By seizing the opportunity to inspire and connect, writers can cultivate dedicated fans.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that the majority of readers will not grant the chance for a sticky second-impression interaction. They will read, move on, and likely remain anonymous statistics. However, within this broader audience base, some readers will actively engage – seeking writers out on social media, subscribing to email lists, anticipating future works, and even recommending the writer's content to friends. It is crucial to remember that these readers are individuals who have chosen to spend their limited free time with our work.\n\nIn a world where social media dictates popularity based on follower ratios, it is crucial to recall the personal impact of genuine connections. I vividly remember when my daughter's favorite author followed her on Twitter, an interaction that solidified her loyalty. As writers, we have the power to establish meaningful connections with readers, transforming our work into a dialogue rather than monologue. This requires significantly more effort than a simple click of the \"follow\" button, but it is precisely what sets apart the truly influential authors.\n\nWhen considering the impact of various authors, it is not their first impression that resonates the most. For instance, I cannot recall the first Judy Blue book I read, but I will forever cherish the experience of reading \"Tiger Eyes\" when it was first published in 1981. It was the first time I felt a deep sense of kinship with an author, as if they truly understood me. Decades later, I continue to purchase Blue's books for my own children and share them with friends. Meeting her in person at a book event was a cherished moment, one that stemmed from the sticky impression she made during my formative years.\n\nIn conclusion, as writers, we can absorb countless advice pieces and strategies, but these resources will be for naught if we fail to forge genuine connections with our readers. It is not necessary to form individual relationships with every reader, as that would be an impossible feat. However, by acknowledging and valuing our readers as individuals who have chosen to invest their time in our work, we can create an immersive and lasting conversation. To encapsulate the essence of making an impact, I think of authors such as Judy Blue, Meg Cabot, Chuck Palahniuk, Stephen King, Ellen Hopkins, Ray Bradbury, Octavia Butler, and Judy Blue, among countless others. They all succeeded in crafting stories that invited readers into an intimate connection, leaving indelible impressions that transcend time and age. END"}

The order of the first three elements that readers see when opening your article should be as follows: (1) title, (2) subtitle, and (3) cover image. To ensure consistency, please maintain this sequence.\n\nWhen formatting the title, please capitalize all major words while keeping minor words in lowercase. You can also use a title case converter to adjust your titles. It is vital to write quality headlines that are specific, spark interest, communicate clearly, and maintain a clean and professional tone. Avoid confusing terms, general statements, insider jargon, typos, and profanity. Remember to focus on delivering valuable content rather than resorting to clickbait tactics. Your story must back up the claims made in the headline. Refrain from using all-caps titles, as it can appear unprofessional.\n\nThe subtitle should be written directly below the title and capitalize only the first word and any proper nouns. Please avoid using all capital letters and refrain from including links in the title and subtitle. Both the title and subtitle should be clear, descriptive, and engaging, as they are the first elements that users see when viewing your story. Don't forget to update both the content and SEO title and description to ensure consistency and maximize search engine visibility.\n\nIn terms of cover images, it is crucial to include a high-resolution image at the top of your story, right beneath the headline. This practice has several benefits, such as making your story more prominent in social media news feeds and attracting more clicks. The ideal image width should match the text body of your article. While wider sizes are preferred, charts and complex images may require larger dimensions to ensure readability. Please avoid using widescreen or expanded formatting for images and keep them within the body-width limits.\n\nAs a writer, you hold the responsibility for copyright infringement. To attribute an image properly, include the words \"Image credit\" below the image and link the text to its original source. Only use images for which you have the appropriate rights and permissions. Failure to comply with copyright regulations will disqualify your story from curation. All images used in your article must include proper attribution to their respective sources.\n\nWhen using your own pictures, add a caption mentioning the author or simply state \"Image by [Author]\" or \"Picture by [Author].\" In case you need images that can be used without permission, reputable sources include Pixels, Unsplash, or Google (search for images labeled for creative commons licenses).\n\nTo enhance the organization of your article, use correctly formatted section headings. Every post should only have one \"Heading 1\" for the title, while \"Heading 2\" should be used for main subheadings that support the title. \"Heading 3\" can be used for subheadings that support the main \"Heading 2\" topics.\n\nWhen creating lists, use bullet points by starting a new line and typing a dash (\"-\") or asterisk (\"*\") followed by a space. For a numbered list, start a new line, type \"1.\" followed by a space, and subsequent numbers will be added automatically.\n\nTo mention other Medium users, type \"@\" followed by the person's name to link to their profile and send them a notification upon publication.\n\nAdditionally, please remember to add alt text to your images. Alt text assists visually impaired readers and improves search engine optimization. To add alt text, click the \"Edit Story\" tab, select the image, click on the \"Alt-text\" button, provide a brief description of the image, and save your changes.\n\nLastly, you can set a focal point on your featured image to optimize thumbnail and preview images on Medium. Instructions on how to set a focal point can be found in Medium's documentation. END"}
{"prompt":"i biked across canada in the summer of 2017 . i had just finished my master’s degree , which was a very challenging experience — and not really in a good way . as i was finishing my thesis , i decided i needed to do something to recover . i wanted to do something difficult , but i didn’t want to think too hard . i didn’t want to rely on other people for my success . i wanted to get out of my head and into my body . so i bought a bike and started pedalling . between june and september , i cycled 7 , 400 kilometres ( about 4 , 600 miles ) from victoria , british columbia to st . john’s , newfoundland . then , a few years ago , i started a freelance writing business . riding 7 , 400 kilometres across the country seems like a very different endeavour than creating a business , but a lot of the things i learned from my bike tour have actually helped me with both my writing and figuring out how to create a business from scratch . here are a few of those things . your best ideas come when you’re moving photos by the author . left thunder bay , ontario . middle a highway rest stop , alberta . right the cabot trail , nova scotia . the two months i spent on that bike were the most creative two months i’ve ever had . it was a free flow , idea after idea , for five hours a day . there’s lots of research to support the idea that exercising helps us be more creative . but i didn’t realize how powerful the effect of exercise really was . as soon as i was on the bike , i found myself solving problems , making connections , and generating ideas . i use this as a practice all the time now with my writing . when i’m stuck with something , i go for a walk , go to the gym , or even do housework . ( i actually had the idea for this article while i was washing dishes . ) it’s productive and it helps ignite creativity . keep a journal ( even when you’re tired ) your best ideas may come when you’re exercising , but they will also disappear if you don’t capture them . i learned about disappearing ideas the hard way . everyone asked me if i was keeping a blog for my trip . i sort of did , but i was very haphazard about it . now that i write blogs for a living , i’m kicking myself for not taking it more seriously . i took notes occasionally , but not nearly as many as i should have . after cycling all day , setting up camp , making dinner , and washing my shorts , i just wanted to lie down . i felt too tired and told myself i would do it tomorrow . but then , i would be busy in the mornings making breakfast , packing up , and trying to get an early start . and then i biked all day . there never seemed to be time . i forgot most of those ideas that i had while i was biking . when i look back , i see that i wasted so much of the creative opportunity that i had simply by not taking notes . so the lesson for me was to journal regularly . now i keep a journal by my bed and a file in the notes app on my phone for random ideas . i also have a proper journal where i usually try to write an anecdote or two about my day . and i’m disciplined about it — even when i’m tired , i try to write at least one short story . the five minutes i spend jotting down my ideas will absolutely be worth it later . some tools are essential —and some aren’t photos by the author . left lake louise , alberta . right vancouver , british columbia . there’s a whole culture around biking equipment . when i started , i had no idea what was important and what wasn’t . people give different advice some say disc brakes are essential because they stop the fastest others say you want v-breaks because they can be fixed anywhere . some people say you need to have front panniers to balance the weight on your bike properly others say they make your bike too heavy . virtually everyone will tell you that you need cycling shorts . i didn’t have a lot of money , so i opted for a minimalist version of all that . i used v-breaks because that’s what the bike i bought off craigslist had . i didn’t buy front panniers i just packed everything on the back and held it on with bungee cords . i wore regular basketball shorts . over time , i learned what was essential and what wasn’t . v-brakes are fine , as long as they work — but make sure they work . you don’t need front panniers , you just have to be okay with less stuff . but it turns out those sleek cycling shorts aren’t just for making your butt look great — they are actually designed to prevent saddle sores . ( ask me how i know . ) they’re essential . the lesson i took from my experience with biking gear was to find a basic system that worked and then to focus on cycling . tweak as needed . i’ve applied this strategy to my writing business , as well . there are lots of people selling courses or giving advice on how to cold call potential clients , how to write blog posts that rank on google , whether you need a website , and which grammar app you should use . i still don’t have a lot of money , so i applied the same strategy that i did with biking start with something basic , focus on writing , and then adapt . i’ve been fine without expensive online courses , but a couple of seo courses on coursera were really useful . a website was essential . the free version of grammarly is fine for me . find a system that works for you and then focus on writing . tweak as needed . talk to strangers they’re so helpful . strangers gave me information about the best bike routes , the best places to camp , and how to avoid bears . they gave me food and water . they gave me places to sleep . at a beautiful beach in marathon , ontario , this lady from new york and her aussie boyfriend made me a meal on a fire and then left me with a bag of chaga mushrooms . at a tim hortons in new brunswick , a stranger came up and gave me $50 ( he felt sorry for me ) . this lovely couple on prince edward island made me and this other guy a full lobster dinner . at a lighthouse on the cabot trail , moe and elaine from massachusetts invited me to stay on the extra bed in their trailer . cycling taught me that most people , most of the time , are really great . they will help you . writing is the same . it was only relatively recently that i decided to try to connect with other writers . i started with reddit and i’m still getting into medium , but in both places i’ve found other writers to be really useful . writers have great advice . they share connections . they pass on leads . joining a writing community has been highly beneficial for me . cycling is a solo sport , and yet it’s way easier with support . writing is the same you do it alone , but it’s somehow still way easier when you have a community around you . most of it is grunt work photos by the author . left schreiber , ontario . middle swift current , saskatchewan . right morley , alberta . cycling a really long way seems like it would be hard . but it isn’t really . to successfully cycle a really long way , you just have to consistently get on the bike and pedal . you do that over and over and over and , eventually , you’ll find that you have gone a really long way . the cycling part is easy . but it’s an endurance sport — the hard part is doing it for a long time , over and over . writing is a lot harder than cycling . you can do it badly . ( you can’t really do cycling badly . ) so it’s not quite the same . but here’s what they have in common the trick to being successful is just doing it . you get on the computer , and you type for a long time , and when you do that enough , you find that you have written something . it’s not glamorous or magical it’s grunt work . writing , like cycling , is an endurance sport . you are what you do there’s a strange kind of identity that comes with cycling . i never really thought of myself as an athlete , and certainly not as a cyclist . i’d never done much cycling at all , except as a way to get to school or work . i knew nothing about bikes themselves , the equipment , or cycling culture . ( the first time someone asked me what kind of bike i had , my answer was , “a black one . ” ) but once you’re on the bike , you’re a cyclist . it’s the same for writing . if you are making money from writing — any money at all — you’re a writer . it helps to remember that when you’re finding it difficult and you feel a bit like an imposter . like somehow you’re not a real writer . have you written something ? did you make money from it ? then you are a writer . don’t worry about whether you’re a real writer . you are . just worry about the writing . someone is always better than you photos by the author . left emerald lake , alberta . right the confederation bridge , new brunswick . everyone who saw the bundle of gear attached to my bike asked me where i was going . and it seemed like each of them knew someone who had biked across canada better than me . one person knew someone who did it in 50 days , which was 30 days faster than me . someone prepared for a whole year before they did it . one couple didn’t prepare at all they just bought a bike spur-of-the-moment while they were on vacation and started without a backwards glance . another person knew someone who rode 400 kilometres in one day , in a storm with the wind at their back . someone spent almost nothing on the trip . someone else had no gear he just carried a credit card and stayed in hotels . some people i met were doing this for their second or third or 12th time . virtually everyone knew more about bikes , the geography , the route , or the weather than me . there was always someone doing it better . but in the end , i still got there just like they did . writing is the same . it seems like everyone is publishing articles about how they made six figures in their first year , or how to write a $500 article in 40 minutes . ( speaking of which , congratulations on $11 , 000 in 30 days , tim ! ) there are lots of writers ( the majority of them , probably ) who are funnier , smarter , and more interesting than me . lots of people have written more . lots of people publish in fancy places . they’re doing it better . but i am writing for a living . i am certainly not making six figures , but i’m sustainable and paying off my student loans . i’m getting there . the lesson is not to worry about whether you’re the best . you’re not . but you’re good enough . keep pedalling . you make your own journey i met lots of people on the same journey as me . there was the new doctor on his sprint bike eating nothing but power bars . there was mike , an ex tech ceo with his sturdy bike packed with 200 pounds of gear , slowly trudging away using peanut m&ms for fuel . there was the vegetarian cyclist couple who were 17 years old and doing 250 kilometres a day , but who had one of their dads following behind them , carrying their camping gear in his truck . there was the 88-year-old woman doing it for the 12th time . there was grace , the pole dancer , who mostly rode but sometimes hitchhiked ( “whatever . it’s my trip . ” ) and who determined her route in part based on tragically hip songs . each of these people had their own style and were on their own journey . each one succeeded . this can also be applied to writing . i’ve known people who were on many different journeys some became content writers after a career in journalism others started writing after they quit their sales career . i have a friend who was a musician before specializing in product descriptions . my background was in academia and government where i wrote about research and its implications for policy . people can help and give you advice , but each person’s writing journey is different . it’s a bit scary , but it’s empowering , too . do your own thing . just get started photos by the author . left osoyoos , british columbia . middle st . johns , newfoundland . right slocan lake , british columbia . one of the most common questions i got leading up to the trip was what i was doing to prepare for it . i told people i was riding a lot , but actually i wasn’t . i rode the stationary bike at the gym for 20 minutes . i did that three times , total . that’s it . the truth is that i didn’t really prepare at all . i had read a blog post ( thank you affiliate marketing ! ) that said that the best way to prepare to cycle long distances was simply to cycle long distances . you could train as you go . just don’t go too hard too fast and you’d be fine . that was my strategy . the first couple of weeks were difficult , but i got through them . and then it was easier . to be fair , the first couple of weeks also had three mountain ranges , one of which was the rockies… so . the point is that the most important thing was to just start . i’ve found that a writing business is the same . you can learn it as you go . sure , it helps if you have some experience writing professionally and some knowledge of grammar rules . there are probably things you can do to prepare for starting a business — getting a legit website set up , doing some research , picking a niche , building a network . maybe taking one of the many expensive courses that are out there . but really , the idea that you need to be “qualified” to be a writer is a myth . you can learn to write as you’re writing . you just need to get started . there’s no “right” way to success at first glance , cycling across canada doesn’t appear to have a lot in common with starting a business . but here’s what they share they are both big undertakings that can feel impossible at the start . and there are different ways to actually do them . lots of expert writers will give you specific tools , tips , and tricks that can help you write professionally or start a business . that can be helpful . but what i learned from my trip , and what i’ve applied to my writing business , is that there are lots of “right” ways to be successful . use other people’s advice , sure , but don’t get overwhelmed trying to be a writer the right way . you can do it your way . you’ve got what it takes . take the guidance that’s useful to you , leave what isn’t . try things out , experiment . and then work really hard at writing . after a while , you’ll get there .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the summer of 2017, I embarked on a remarkable journey. Fresh off completing my master's degree, which proved to be a challenging experience, I felt the need to recover and do something difficult, yet without overthinking it. I desired independence and a break from relying on others for my success. So, I made the decision to purchase a bike and set off on an adventure. Over the course of four months, I pedaled a staggering 7,400 kilometers, from Victoria, British Columbia, to St. John's, Newfoundland. Little did I know that the lessons I learned during this bike tour would greatly assist me in my freelance writing business and in building a successful career from scratch. Here are a few key takeaways from my incredible journey:\n\n1. Embrace movement for enhanced creativity: During those two months on the bike, I experienced an unparalleled surge of creativity. Research supports the notion that exercise sparks creativity, but I was astounded by just how powerful this effect was. As I pedaled away, I found myself effortlessly solving problems, making connections, and generating a plethora of ideas. I now utilize this practice regularly in my writing. Whenever I encounter a creative roadblock, I take a walk, visit the gym, or even engage in household chores. This not only proves productive but also ignites my creativity.\n\n2. Document your ideas without fail: While exercise may fuel creativity, ideas can quickly dissipate if not captured. Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way. Many people urged me to maintain a blog throughout my cycling journey, but I foolishly neglected to take it seriously. As a professional writer now, I deeply regret not documenting my experiences more diligently. Although I occasionally jotted down notes, it simply wasn't enough. Fatigue often prevented me from diligently recording my ideas, and as a result, I lost countless valuable insights. Recognizing the importance of preserving ideas, I now keep a journal by my bedside, use the notes app on my phone for random musings, and have a dedicated journal for daily anecdotes. I am disciplined about this practice, ensuring that even on tiresome days, I always write at least one short story. These five minutes spent jotting down ideas prove to be invaluable in the long run.\n\n3. Essential tools and their significance: Biking culture introduced me to the concept of essential equipment. Initially, I was clueless about what was truly crucial and what was merely optional. Different individuals offered conflicting advice – some extolled the importance of disc brakes for optimal performance, while others championed v-brakes for their versatility. Front panniers were recommended by some for proper weight distribution, while others warned about the additional weight they would impose. However, everyone agreed on the indispensability of cycling shorts. Given my financial limitations, I opted for a minimalist approach. I made do with v-brakes, packed all my belongings at the back with bungee cords, and wore regular basketball shorts. Over time, I learned what was truly essential and what was not. V-brakes sufficed as long as they were functional, front panniers were not necessary if one was content with minimal possessions, but cycling shorts proved vital for preventing saddle sores. This taught me an invaluable lesson—to identify a basic system that works and focus on the task at hand. The same approach applies to my writing business. Amidst a sea of advice on cold calling, blog writing, websites, and grammar apps, I embarked on my journey with a simple foundation, concentrating primarily on my writing while making necessary adjustments along the way. I found that this strategy served me well without unnecessary expenses.\n\n4. Seek support from strangers: Throughout my cycling adventure, I encountered countless strangers who offered invaluable assistance. They provided information about the best bike routes, campsites, and tips for evading bears. Some even went as far as offering food, water, and places to stay. I vividly recall a heartwarming encounter with a couple on Prince Edward Island who treated me to a lavish lobster dinner. These experiences taught me that the majority of people are genuinely kind-hearted and ever-willing to help. Similarly, I discovered the benefits of connecting with other writers. Initially hesitant, I eventually joined online writing communities and found fellow writers to be incredibly supportive. They shared advice, provided valuable connections, and shared leads. Engaging with this community proved to be highly beneficial in my writing journey.

( this change was only applicable to topics that didn’t use key based partitioning since ordering couldn’t be guaranteed after az awareness change , as a partition switches az . ) consumer az awareness s3 transporter is responsible for reading logs from kafka and persisting them to s3 for further processing . we tried something similar to the producer for s3 transporter . our s3 transporter doesn’t use kafka consumer assignments . rather , it uses its own partition assignment system . this allows us to preserve locality in case of node restarts or has temporary network isolation , thus reducing the amount of data that needs to be replayed for a given batch . we make each s3 transporter worker look up and publish its az info to zookeeper , which helps the s3 transporter master assign kafka partitions to the workers based on their rack ( az ) . if we are unable to look up the ( rack ) az information of a partition , we degrade to assignment across all available workers . results we rolled out az aware s3 transporter to production , which resulted in more than 25% savings in az transfer cost for logging . we’re currently in the process of slowly rolling out az aware logging agent to further reduce our az transfer costs . we’re also working to extend this design to standard kafka producers and consumers to help us extend our savings to other applications as well , which may include kip-392 once it’s implemented . acknowledgements huge thanks to eric lopez , henry cai , heng zhang , ping-min lin , vahid hashemian , yi yin , yinian qi and yu yang who helped with improving logging at pinterest . also , thanks to kalim moghul for helping us with this effort .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Title: Reducing Data Transfer Costs in Kafka through Locality Aware Systems\n\nIntroduction:\nOperating applications in the cloud requires safeguarding against outages by spreading deployments across multiple failure domains. In this article, we explore how making Kafka producers and consumers rack aware and developing locality aware systems can substantially reduce costs. By leveraging data-driven engineering decisions, we can continuously improve fault tolerance and efficiency in cloud environments.\n\nBackground:\nIn a public cloud environment, availability zones (AZ's) serve as failure domains. Traditionally, distributed systems like HDFS have been made rack aware to improve fault tolerance by spreading replicas across multiple racks in a datacenter. However, when running in cloud environments, using AZ's as rack information is a common practice. This enables the spreading of data copies across multiple AZ's, providing fault tolerance in case one fails.\n\nThe Challenge:\nWhile replicating data across AZ's provides fault tolerance, it does come with a premium in the form of AZ transfer costs. Pinterest extensively utilizes Kafka as a scalable and fault-tolerant distributed message bus. However, due to its large scale, minimizing the amount of data transferred across AZ's becomes crucial to optimize costs.\n\nApproach:\nThere are two potential ways to solve the problem. Firstly, we can make our producers and consumers write or read data only for partitions whose leaders share the same AZ, making them more cost-efficient. Alternatively, we could deploy AZ-specific Kafka clusters, but this would require other real-time consumers to make their business logic AZ aware. We chose to implement the first approach as it minimized code and stack changes, ensuring simplicity.\n\nAchieving Producer AZ Awareness:\nTo make producers AZ aware, we enhanced our logging agent, responsible for reading data from log files and shipping them to Kafka in microbatches. The logging agent now looks up the AZ info for the node it's running on using the EC2 metadata API. We also updated our partitioned to leverage rack information in Kafka's producer metadata, limiting writes to only partitions with leaders in the same AZ as the logging agent. This change was applicable to topics that didn't use key-based partitioning.\n\nAchieving Consumer AZ Awareness:\nSimilarly, for the S3 transporter, responsible for reading logs from Kafka and persisting them to S3, we implemented AZ awareness. Each S3 transporter worker looks up and publishes its AZ info to ZooKeeper, which helps the S3 transporter master assign Kafka partitions to workers based on their rack (AZ). In cases where the AZ information is unavailable, we default to assignment across all available workers.\n\nResults and Future Work:\nThe rollout of AZ-aware S3 transporter to production resulted in over 25% savings in AZ transfer costs for logging. Pinterest is gradually rolling out AZ-aware logging agent to further reduce AZ transfer costs. Additionally, efforts are underway to extend this design to standard Kafka producers and consumers, enabling savings for other applications as well.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nWe would like to thank Eric Lopez, Henry CAI, Hung Zhang, Ping-Min Lin, Valid Baseman, Yi Yin, Indian Qi, You Yang, and Kali Mogul for their valuable contributions in improving logging at Pinterest.

It is highly likely that you have a sense of what you want to do with your life, even if it may not be crystal clear. Our unique set of characteristics, influenced by our DNA, often guide us toward certain activities and develop specific inclinations and desires from a young age. However, as we grow up, external factors may instill fears and societal expectations that divert us from pursuing what truly aligns with our desires.\n\nSociety has a way of compelling us to conform to certain norms, making it challenging to be true to yourself and pursue your genuine aspirations. The opposing incentives can be overwhelming. However, if you intend to defy the odds and create a life that truly reflects who you are, you must rediscover your authentic self and acknowledge that you already possess the knowledge of what you want.\n\nReflecting on my own journey, I have always known that I wanted to be a writer. Words have fascinated me from a young age, and I effortlessly possessed an extensive vocabulary. Writing poems during my middle school years and casually mentioning my desire to write a book countless times highlighted my inner certainty. Business also intrigued me, and the idea of freedom captivated my imagination. I fostered a deep curiosity about life and success. All the necessary tools were available; I just needed to take action. Similarly, I believe that within you lies the understanding of what you desire to become; perhaps you are merely postponing its pursuit.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with an Uber driver during a ride to the airport in Los Angeles. When she inquired about my profession, I mentioned that I was a self-improvement writer. Consequently, she proceeded to share her life story and sought advice. She drove for Uber to earn extra income while attempting to resolve a dispute concerning a debt or property taxes, I can't recall precisely. Frustrated and overwhelmed, she discussed her past work experiences, her potential dreams, and potential strategies to overcome her predicament. We conversed back and forth, never quite reaching the root of the issue or discovering a viable solution. It became apparent that she was hiding from her true potential.\n\nThis conversation persisted for an hour, largely due to the heavy traffic in Los Angeles. As we approached the airport, she mentioned her extensive consulting experience and disclosed that she had previously received offers to work with companies. Suddenly, she uttered, \"Maybe I should start a business doing that.\" Deep down, I thought to myself, \"Yes, perhaps you should.\" It is a peculiar aspect of human behavior to avoid the obvious answers that lie directly in front of us. Why? Because simplicity can be unsettling. If it truly is that straightforward, we feel foolish for not taking action. Consequently, we construct complex excuses that are easier to grapple with than facing the unadorned truth.\n\nNumerous instances of this pattern permeate my experiences. I often query my social media followers, asking them what kind of business they would initiate if they were guaranteed success. I vividly recall a friend describing her potential business, outlining every detail, including the name. Furthermore, I genuinely hope she realizes her plans one day. Furthermore, I extend the same plea to you—to embark on your own endeavor, be it a bakery, an e-commerce business, a comedy career, a daycare center, a jewelry shop in a bustling tourist area, or any other pursuit that ignites your passion.\n\nSo, how can one overcome the fear that leads to procrastination? The process I apply for self-improvement encompasses identifying the problem at its core and diligently devising effective solutions. Allow us to examine some underlying causes of your inaction.

In this article, I will discuss three effective strategies that I personally used to overcome my fear of criticism and find success as a writer.\n\n1. Remember, Your Haters Don't Know You:\nWhen faced with criticism or negativity, it is important to remind yourself that those who criticize your work do not truly know you as an individual. Often, these individuals have their own personal agenda or unresolved issues, and your work simply serves as a trigger for them. It is crucial to understand that their reactions say more about them than they do about you. So, rather than engaging in pointless arguments, it is best to close their comments without responding, cleanse your energy if necessary, and move forward.\n\n2. Seek Guidance from Your Future Writing Self:\nWithout a writing coach, it may be challenging to navigate through self-doubt. However, one effective approach is to imagine your ideal future self as a successful writer. Visualize yourself, six to twelve months from now, with a portfolio of published works and a track record of success. In doing so, you can tap into the wisdom of this version of yourself and ask what steps they would advise you to take. It is highly unlikely that your future self would discourage you from expressing your thoughts for fear of disagreement. Embrace the confidence and guidance of your future self to overcome self-doubt in the present.\n\n3. Write for Your Biggest Fans:\nImagine having a dedicated audience who eagerly awaits your next piece of writing. While you may believe that you lack such fans currently, it is essential to write as if you have them. Writing with enthusiasm and conviction will naturally attract readers who resonate with your work. As I have personally experienced, there have been instances where I discovered unexpected fans through my writing. By focusing on writing for these dedicated supporters, you can establish connections and expand your readership.\n\nIn conclusion, self-doubt and fear of criticism are common obstacles for writers. However, it is crucial to remember that unwarranted criticism is often a reflection of the critic's own issues rather than a judgment of your abilities. By connecting with your future writing self, seeking guidance from within, and writing for your hypothetical fan base, you can overcome self-doubt and achieve success in your writing endeavors.

These types include expository, persuasive, narrative, and descriptive writing. Regardless of the genre or subject, every piece of writing falls into one or more of these categories.\n\nExpository writing is a means for authors to inform and educate readers. Its purpose is to explain or teach something. In this article, for instance, I am employing expository writing to elucidate the four types of writing. Textbooks and how-to articles also make use of this style, as they aim to provide clear explanations. Even recipes can be considered a form of expository writing, as they guide the reader on how to complete a culinary creation. Another example of expository writing can be found in newspapers, where writers strive to keep readers informed about daily events.\n\nPersuasive writing, on the other hand, is a way for authors to express their opinions and convince readers to agree with their arguments. This type of writing is commonly found in speeches, scientific studies, medical journals, and even political campaigns. Advertisements, book reviews, editorials, and brochures also utilize persuasive writing techniques. The goal is to persuade the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint. Concrete examples of persuasive writing can be seen in scientific studies and medical journals.\n\nNarrative writing involves the art of storytelling. Authors use this approach to captivate readers by presenting a story, whether fictional or factual, with a main character, a conflict, and a resolution. Fictional stories are considered narrative writing as they follow the journey of a character working through their conflicts in search of resolution. However, non-fiction can also take on a narrative form, as there is still a main character, a conflict, and a plot. Whether real or imagined, narrative writing allows readers to immerse themselves in a captivating tale.\n\nDescriptive writing, a subcategory of expository writing, is characterized by its use of vivid descriptions to paint a picture for the reader. It focuses on creating sensory experiences, involving sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch. Descriptive writing brings characters, settings, and objects to life, enabling readers to visualize the story as they read. It is an essential element in both fiction and non-fiction writing, as it assists in engaging the reader's imagination.\n\nIn conclusion, storytelling - whether it be expository, persuasive, narrative, or descriptive - is the art of crafting words that evoke excitement and engagement from the reader.

{"prompt":"amazon web service ( aws ) aws is owned by amazon and it is the number one cloud provider , according to the public cloud share . that is the percentage of companies , the money involved in aws is around 32% right now . so it is the maximum and that’s why aws is the leader in the cloud industry for the past 10 to 15 years . microsoft azure azure is owned by microsoft , and it comes second only to aws . they are second in the cloud race and they are again the same type of technology . so azure is provided by microsoft , but even then they are just a cloud provider like aws . similarities between aws and azure so both provide similar services , even though they provide similar services , they are two different entities owned by two different companies providing various services which are named differently . but their functionality is going to be the same . so i think you get the point that aws and azure are cloud providers owned by amazon and microsoft , respectively . aws is the number one in cloud market share and azure is number two and these two are the major cloud providers in the entire cloud computing industry . aws vs azure 1 . launch date aws launched in the year 2006 and azure launched in the year 2010 . so basically in technology years , 4 years is a very long gap and that is one of the main reasons aws has captured a lot of businesses and are in the lead in the cloud computing race aws came into the cloud industry , but ec2 and s3 as the first projects of their first tools which were out for the public . and in 2010 , azure came up with basic services , like virtual machines , azure storage , azure database . so they came up with their own services . 2 . regions aws has 77 availability zones in 24 geographical regions across the globe . so these availability zones are the ones that have the physical servers , all the physical components which are required to launch service , database engines , or storage units . so aws is the cloud provider that has the maximum number of availability zones in the world . why is availability zones really important ? let’s say you’re from india , you’re launching an application in india and it’s very successful and your customer base is growing even out of the country . when that is happening , you want to expand your application to a global audience , and if you’re using an on-premise set up with your own data center , a small data center . so in this case , you’ll have to buy more servers to accommodate more users or you’ll have to buy the servers in whichever location or whichever country in which you are going to extend your application . you’ll have to buy a data center over there , or you’ll have to buy a location , buy a space and set up a data center . but instead of doing that , if you’re using aws or if you’re using azure , in that case , you can use their global infrastructure and set up your application anywhere in the world just by sitting in your own office . so we can do that across the globe and you can engage your application with the global audience . now , azure has 60 different availability zones , but they are in 60 different regions , which is most by any cloud provider . so even though aws was early in the cloud business , microsoft was early in the tech business . microsoft came into the tech business way before amazon came into it . so amazon first launched as an e-commerce website , not a tech website or a website that provides cloud services . so microsoft was already having a wide infrastructure across the world . so they were able to build their architecture accordingly . so their cloud infrastructure has grown across the globe in 60 different regions . why regions are important ? let me give you a brief example . over here in india , there are three different availability zones in one particular region , which is in mumbai . but if you look at india in azure , you can see west india , central india , and south india . so they have three different available results in three different regions , which can be helpful for low latency in applications . so let’s say your application is mostly concentrated in south india , you can host it on the south indian data center . if it is in central india or if you want to concentrate on the whole of india , you can put in all the data centers . or if you just want to concentrate on the north side of india or the west side of india , you can go ahead with the west or central india . the same goes for every single available zone or every single region available across . so this is a difference . aws has 77 availability zones but in 24 geographical regions . microsoft has 60 available zones lesser than aws , but they have it in 60 different regions . that’s the main difference . also at the beginning of 2019 , aws had 54 availability zones and azure had 44 availability zones . so both of them have grown pretty wildly . in 2021 , aws is planning to build 18 more availability zones in six more regions , and azure is planning to get 8 more available zones in 3 more azure regions . so they’re still planning more regions . 3 . market share as a common person , it doesn’t matter . you can choose any of the cloud services which you want and you can start working on it and you can get a job in it . but why do we talk about market share ? so let me tell you . first , whenever the market share for a particular business means a lot of businesses or a lot of companies are using that particular technology . so let’s say aws if their market share or their spending on that particular cloud provider is high . in that case , a lot of companies are investing in aws . so if a lot of companies are investing in aws , that means you have an abundance of jobs in various companies . so if you go with aws or azure or google cloud , you have a lot of companies who are working with them . you can get into a job with them . according to gartner aws is the leading cloud service provider . so this means they are visionaries and they are leaders . so microsoft , google , amazon services all come under leaders and visionaries . but the leading leaders are amazon web services and the leading visionary is amazon web services . 4 . niche players this means the cloud services providers play on their particular role . so alibaba cloud or oracle or ibm or tencent cloud , they have their cloud services which can accommodate their own company’s infrastructure and the companies which are using similar services and that’s why they are called niche players . they only play in that particular area . they don’t move out of their expertise . but aws , microsoft , and google are exploring the entire industry from healthcare , from retail to i . t . companies . so every single place they have put down their staff . 5 . clients now , the top clients of amazon web services are netflix , twitch , linkedin , and facebook . so i think most probably , you know , these four different services at four different websites . so netflix is the top media streaming platform in the world . twitch is the top live streaming platform in the world . linkedin is the top job connectivity or job finding portal in the world . and facebook is the largest social media network in the world . so four of these companies are using amazon web services for their cloud needs . for azure , the top spending companies or the top companies using are bmw , twitter , samsung , and ebay . again , you would obviously know all of these companies . they are top companies who are using azure for their cloud needs . so if you are working well enough , you can get into these companies as a cloud architect or you can get into the previous companies , which i mentioned , netflix , facebook or linkedin or even ebay or twitter . so you can get into these companies if you are a cloud architect or a cloud developer or an administrator or whatever it is , you can get into these companies and get a high salary . 6 . services in aws , the relevant service is ec2 and in azure , it is azure virtual machine . so both of these services provide a secure , scalable , and reliable compute capacity ( i . e ) a server in the cloud . you can create a server as per your needs on the cloud . 7 . storage in azure , you have to go to azure blob storage . in aws , you have to go to aws s3 or aws simple storage service . so again , these two are similar services , s3 uses object storage to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere . massively scalable and secure object storage for cloud-native workloads are archives and data lakes . so basically they are similar , just different explanations or different definitions for the same service , but they are provided by two different organizations . 8 . database aws has a relational database service and azure has sql databases . what is the difference between a relational database and an sql database ? they both use sql and they are both database engines . in aws , set up an operate and scalable relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks . in azure , built apps that scale with the pace of your business with managed and intelligent sql in the cloud . so basically you can create a cloud engine on both . you can create a database on the cloud which is scalable , so you can set it up as scaled automatically , so it’ll automatically scale up for you . so in this case , they have similar services , the only major part is that aws provides more services than azure . aws provides more than 150+ services right now , because , again , saying that they have a 4 years lead in the cloud computing industry , that’s why they are leading by a lot . even azure provides a lot of services , they provide 100+ services , not as much as aws . so you can go with any of them . in the year 2021 , both of them are growing at a really fast pace and other cloud services are trying to catch up with them , but they’re not able to . aws and azure are still growing , so you can go ahead and take up aws or azure , there is no problem in taking up any of these cloud providers . 9 . pricing structure pricing models are one of the important factors before considering the cloud tool . in aws , you have a pay-as-you-go model completely . it means whatever you use , you’ll pay for that at the end of the month . so you’ll start with zero credit . as you use services , it’ll succumb up to a particular value or a particular amount of money which will be paying at the end of the month . even azure has pay-as-you-go , you can opt for that or there are also subscriptions where you can take up subscriptions that have certain limits within azure . so you can use that credit limit to go ahead and use the azure service , which you want . for 4 vcplus and 16-gigabyte memory , the on-demand linux instance in aws will cost you 0 . 1856 dollars . but the same type of instance in azure will cost you 0 . 1690 dollars . so now , just considering these two values , they’re are quite small and there is not much difference , it’s just like 0 . 15 or something like that . but if you’re server is running for 24*7 and there are 100s of servers with the same specifications that will save you a lot of money if you’re using azure in this case . but again , there is one more difference . that is in aws , you’ll get more discounts if you’re taking up a one-year reserved or a three-year reserved instance and that means you will get a dedicated instance , dedicated server , where you can run instances at any time , and that can save you 42% of the money and in azure , it can save you around 36% of the money . so aws could be cheaper for the long run azure will be cheaper if you’re going to use on-demand instances . one more part is that in aws , you’ll be charged by the hour , ( i . e ) even though you have used a particular service for just one-minute even in that case , you’ll be charged by the hour . so you’ll have to pay the hourly rate . but in azure , you’ll only be charged the minute rate . so if you’re using only for two minutes , you only pay for the two minutes you have used . you will not pay for the complete half . future predictions for the public cloud infrastructure according to gartner , the cloud infrastructure will improve by 35% in the year 2021 . that means the companies are moving towards the cloud-first approach than an on-premise data centre . it’s increasing every single year , so there is no surprise element here . i just wanted to show what would be the future of the cloud industry . so again , when the cloud industry is growing , i would suggest you to get into it , so that you can grow with the cloud industry . so you can visit these two sites , ( aws . amazon . com and azure . microsoft . com ) this is basically for india . you can check out the news updates which are coming out for aws and azure . they are basically in the latest article at first , so whichever change has been made recently , that will be at the top and you will get to know more about the changes or the changes of services in aws and azure . gain access to expert view — subscribe to ddi intel\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud provider, with a dominant market share of around 32%. It has been the leader in the cloud industry for the past 10 to 15 years. On the other hand, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud provider, owned by Microsoft. While both AWS and Azure offer similar services, they are two separate entities owned by different companies.\n\nBoth AWS and Azure provide various services, although they may have different names. However, their functionality remains the same. AWS has 77 availability zones in 24 geographical regions worldwide, making it the cloud provider with the highest number of availability zones. Azure, on the other hand, has 60 availability zones in 60 different regions.\n\nMarket share is important because it indicates the number of companies using a particular technology. AWS is currently the leading cloud service provider, according to Gartner. This means that there are ample job opportunities within companies that use AWS. While other cloud service providers like Alibaba Cloud, Oracle, IBM, and Tencent Cloud are considered niche players, AWS, Microsoft, and Google explore the entire industry and have a presence in various sectors such as healthcare, retail, and IT.\n\nSome top clients of AWS include Netflix, Twitch, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Azure is used by companies like BMW, Twitter, Samsung, and eBay. Working with these companies as a cloud architect or developer can lead to high-paying jobs.\n\nIn terms of services, AWS offers EC2, while Azure offers Azure Virtual Machine, both providing secure and scalable compute capacity in the cloud. For storage, AWS has Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), while Azure has Azure Blob Storage. Both services allow storing and retrieving data from anywhere, with scalability and security.\n\nWhen it comes to databases, AWS offers Relational Database Service (RDS), while Azure provides SQL databases. Both offer managed and scalable databases in the cloud.\n\nPricing structures vary between AWS and Azure. AWS follows a pay-as-you-go model, where users pay for the services they use at the end of the month. Azure also offers a pay-as-you-go model, as well as subscription options with certain limits.\n\nLooking ahead, the public cloud infrastructure is expected to grow by 35% in 2021, according to Gartner. This indicates a growing trend towards cloud-first approaches over traditional on-premise data centers.\n\nTo stay updated on AWS and Azure, you can visit their respective websites and check for news updates and article releases. Getting into the cloud industry can be a wise decision, considering its continuous growth and demand. END"}
{"prompt":"despite the terrible sars-cov-2 pandemic currently ravaging much of the world , we must try not to forget how far we have come as people of earth in recent years . we also need to maintain an optimistic outlook as much as possible even in the face of truly challenging “black swan” events . this past year has been a big one in terms of technological landmarks — ibm’s q system one became the first commercially available quantum computer . — a new synthetic dna was created which doubles our current 4-letter code ( a , t , c , g ) to 8 , allowing for greater possibilities in dna computing . in another study , scientists injected a synthetic dna into some e . coli bacteria . they survived , reproduced , and actually carried along copies of the synthetic dna as well , offering proof that actual synthetic life can be created in a lab . — researchers put nanoparticles that react to infrared light into the eyes of mice , giving them biological infrared vision . — in a massive project called the event horizon telescope , astronomers linked powerful telescopes from all around the world to create a virtual mega-telescope with an aperture the size of earth , and were able to image the black hole at the center of the messier galaxy 55 million light years away . — 3d printing of human tissue and organs can now be done without using the traditional scaffold model which acts as a support structure , allowing for more possibilities to save lives . and these are only a few large new steps into a world that used to exist only in our imaginations . what might happen in the 2020 ' s ? futurists and other prognosticators have been hard at work coming up with lists , so here is a short one of my own — ai creations will become nearly indistinguishable from the humans or animals they are meant to imitate . — cloning of humans and animals ( extinct or recently deceased ) will continue to be debated by worldwide authorities , while rogue scientists continue to actually do it . expect to see a lot of reborn labradoodles and a real , live baby mammoth , or something similar , by 2030 . — while green power will keep getting more efficient and cheaper , the continued growth in developing nations will stall progress in declining greenhouse emissions . — 3d printing , of everything from organs to electronics and housing , will become a cornerstone of modern manufacturing . — robots and drones will grow into a truly transformative cultural phenomenon , launching new types of entertainment and becoming commonplace in daily life . — quantum computing will lead to a doubling of all human knowledge between 2020 and 2030 . — humans will walk on the moon , or mars , or both . — real , effective life extension therapies will become available , but only for the very wealthy . the rest of us will have to wait a while . — the internet of things will grow into what everyone’s been envisioning for it complete inter-connectivity that enables greater productivity . however , the dangers of hacking will continue to loom over it . now , let me return to the now . looking back a little farther — but still fairly recent — spacex launched the falcon heavy rocket , the largest ever , from nasa’s kennedy space center in february 2018 . its cargo was a tesla roadster , which is now orbiting the sun somewhere between mars and the asteroid belt . between elon musk’s numerous companies and passion projects ( spacex , tesla , solar city , the hyperloop , the boring company ) , and the quickly proceeding advances in vr\/ar\/mr , genetics\/cloning , blockchain , ai , 3d printing , and other fields , someone who was in a coma since 1998 and just woke up yesterday would be forgiven for thinking they had jumped a hundred years into the future instead of a mere 20 . but then this person would actually get up and go out into the real world and see that mostly everything else is the same , aside from more traffic on the roads , more people in general , most of whom now carry miniature computers with them wherever they go that are more powerful than any desktop from the 20th century . elon musk’s grand plan born in apartheid-era south africa , he lived the first 16 years of his life in various towns , including pretoria , moving back and forth between divorced parents . he reports being bullied in school and witnessing a lot of violence . he tried sticking up for some other bullied children , but that generally resulted in more pain for him . musk retreated somewhat into science fiction and fantasy , and the dreams he read on the page would come to inform the man he eventually became . he moved first to canada to live with some relatives , and later earned economics and physics degrees from the university of pennsylvania . he went on to co-found zip2 with one of his brothers , kimbal musk , and greg kouri , which was acquired for $340 million . next , he co-founded x . com , which became paypal and sold to ebay in 2002 for one and half billion dollars . now very rich , elon musk turned his attention to those science fiction dreams . in the short term the environment has been poisoned at an ever-growing pace by the burning of fossil fuels for two centuries , beginning with coal and reaching a pollution peak as the massive population of china began using gasoline-guzzling automobile en masse . musk’s contribution to helping slow this is multi-sided popularize electric cars by offering visually appealing , efficient and powerful versions of them with tesla . invest in more solar power adoption via solar city . open-source a plan for super-fast commuter train transport with the electromagnetic vacuum-tube hyperloop project . invest in tunneling technology that can help move this project along with the boring company . in the long term there have been dozens of small extinction events on earth since the dawn of life , and several that have wiped out 75–95% of all living things . it will happen again , and there is a good chance that a large event will take with it the vast majority of humanity . because of this , musk founded spacex with an ultimate goal of turning humanity into a multi-planet species . he’s funding this by creating reusable rockets that allow him to outbid competitors in taking cargo into orbit . the plan is to start a colony on mars that will eventually be made self-sustaining . ultimately , he thinks this can become home to a million people by roughly 2070 . in other words , elon musk wants to save us here and now , and also do what he can to save us for eternity . all in all , this is both an ambitious and worthy cause . there is nothing wrong with doing what you can to save people . doctors , soldiers , first responders , they do this all the time . and , in general , our governments don’t seem to be doing much to slow our pollution of the environment or protect us from future disasters . yes , there has been some progress , but it is often mired in politics and red tape , and forward-thinking policies of one administration are often reversed by the following one . our governments can barely protect us from rising sea levels and flu virii , let alone giant asteroid impacts . so , someone has to do it . these grand efforts usually form around the resources of extremely wealthy individuals and take many forms . the bill and melinda gates foundation , for instance , focuses on the physical and mental well being of the youngest and poorest people . kimbal musk , one of elon’s brothers , is using his fortune on a decidedly smaller scale in a quest to help reconnect us and our children in particular to a more natural , local and organic food culture . hope is both the strongest driving force and an impediment to progress . many people who grew up in the early to mid 20th century thought we would be living in some kind of fairy-tale sci-fi wonderland by now . others posited it would be a dystopia , or that all that would remain of our world would be a post-apocalyptic wasteland . we’re living in a time when dreams of generations past are becoming true on a regular basis . if a person born anywhere on earth in 1899 were to be transported into the future , to right now , into a modern city , they would find a lot to recognize but they would also be mesmerized by the miraculous pocket computers most people carry with them and the contrails of giant flying ships miles above . said person might even experience a mild cardiac infarction upon seeing evidence that we’ve landed on the moon and are beaming pictures back directly from the surface of mars ( and they might be somewhat disappointed that mars wasn’t teeming with jungle life ) . advancements , just in the medical field , come at a nearly dizzying pace — 2016 saw the use of a drone to take medicine to a remote part of rwanda . this will become more commonplace and will be a great boon to the treatment of medical conditions in isolated parts of the world . — the 1 . 25 million ( and growing ) people in the u . s . who are living with type i diabetes have a ray of hope in the form of a new artificial organ that is an implanted blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery device . eventually this device will also be available for the other 28 million people in the u . s . who have type ii ( adult onset ) diabetes , and over 200 million diabetic people worldwide . — patients suffering from full-body paralysis , with functioning minds who are unable to physically speak — much like the late dr . stephen hawking who lived with als and communicated via a keyboard text-to-speech system — will be able to eventually think what they want and have those thoughts become words . the dreams and nightmares of our fictions have always pointed us to the truth of where we were headed . echoes of george orwell , isaac asimov , ayn rand , jules verne , ursula k . le guin , philip k . dick , p . d . james , arthur c . clarke , and even mary shelley can be seen in our everyday lives . if we take what we have , examine the quickening rate of advancement , and extrapolate into the near future , we can easily believe that ray kurzweil’s singularity is right around the corner . an artificial superintelligence , almost as soon as it realizes what it is , will proceed to surpass humanity in every way , leaving us behind . a super ai is one of the dangers elon musk sees as a potential extinction trigger , so it is likely his goals for a mars colony will include keeping it rather well-separated in many ways from the civilizations of earth . what good would his plan be , anyway , if he brought along to mars the dangers that might doom us here on this planet ? there can be no light without darkness . just as with our development of atomic fission , which led both to the horror of atomic warfare and ( relatively ) clean electrical power for millions , every significant innovation seems to carry with it both extreme positives and extreme negatives . if we want tnt to help greatly increase the building of infrastructure , we must accept it will be used to kill hundreds of thousands of people . if we want safer , cheaper workplaces via robotics , we must remove millions of potential jobs from the marketplace . if we want the convenience of smartphones , we must deal with the repercussions . one of the late dr . stephen hawking’s common refrains was that the greatest threats to our existence come from the technologies that we’ve devised . in essence , by forging ahead we may well become our own downfall . newton’s third law states that for every action , there is an equal but opposite reaction . while this was meant to apply to the physical sciences , it has long since proven to be applicable in our daily lives . what , then , might this mean for the ambitions of elon musk ? might splitting the human race across two separate worlds eventually lead to some solar system civil war that devastates humanity as much as any cosmic or earthbound natural disaster would have ? could gaining a truly massive foothold among consumers with solar and electric car technology upend economies founded on fossil fuels and lead to more war ? do we side with pushing onward despite the consequences ? the odds , based on history , are in favor of something bad being caused by every good intention . but without those good intentions in the first place , virtually no progress would have been made by our civilization over the past 500 years . if you removed every major instance of innovation by humankind since the discovery that we could control fire , we would be living on an earth that looked incredibly different . “we” wouldn’t be here . humanity would amount to a few million individuals at most , living in bands and tribes on plains , in forested river valleys , along coastlines . we would be safer , as a species , only because we did not dare to dream . by dreaming , we discovered there are risks , but we continued because there was always something to fix , something we could do better , somewhere else to go . elon musk , and everyone who thinks like him , understand there are risks . in fact , they know that there will be some bad things , some complications , that arise because of their actions . but a choice had to be made between pressing onward versus sitting still , and they chose to face the darkness so that , at the very least , some light could be shed upon it .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Despite the current global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is important to acknowledge the significant progress humanity has made in recent years. It is crucial to maintain an optimistic outlook, even in the face of challenging events such as \"black swan\" occurrences. Technological advancements have played a major role in shaping our world, with notable milestones achieved in various fields.\n\nFor instance, IBM's Q System One marked a significant achievement as the first commercially available quantum computer. In the realm of genetics, scientists created a new synthetic DNA that expands our current four-letter code to eight, opening up greater possibilities in DNA computing. Another breakthrough involved injecting synthetic DNA into E. coli bacteria, demonstrating the creation of synthetic life in a laboratory setting.\n\nAstronomy also witnessed a remarkable feat with the Event Horizon Telescope project. By linking telescopes from around the world, scientists were able to create a virtual mega-telescope with an aperture the size of Earth, capturing an image of the black hole at the center of the Messier galaxy, located 55 million light years away.\n\nIn the realm of medicine, 3D printing has revolutionized the field by enabling the printing of human tissue and organs without traditional scaffold models, thereby presenting new opportunities to save lives. These advancements represent only a fraction of the significant progress made, paving the way for what the future may hold in the 2020s.\n\nFuturists and experts in the field have been tirelessly working to predict what the coming decade may bring. While many possibilities have been proposed, here are a few noteworthy projections:\n\n- AI creations will become increasingly indistinguishable from humans or animals they intend to imitate.\n- The debate surrounding the cloning of humans and animals, including extinct or recently deceased species, will persist, while some rogue scientists proceed with these experiments. This could potentially lead to the rebirth of labradoodles and the resurrection of extinct species like the mammoth.\n- Despite the continuous growth of green power, progress in reducing greenhouse emissions may stall due to the growth of developing nations.\n- 3D printing will play a pivotal role in modern manufacturing, extending beyond organs to include electronics and housing.\n- Robots and drones will become an integral part of our daily lives, transforming various aspects, including entertainment.\n- The advent of quantum computing is expected to double our collective knowledge between 2020 and 2030.\n- Human exploration of celestial bodies such as the Moon and Mars will become a reality.\n- Effective life extension therapies will emerge, but initially, they will only be accessible to the affluent. Others may have to wait for wider availability.\n- The Internet of Things will progress toward complete interconnectivity, revolutionizing productivity. However, the risks associated with hacking will continue to pose challenges.\n\nLooking back, it is worth mentioning significant milestones that have already shaped our present. SpaceX's launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket, the largest to date, in February 2018, captured global attention. Its payload, an electric Tesla Roadster, currently orbits the sun between Mars and the asteroid belt. This achievement, along with Elon Musk's numerous ventures, including SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity, the Hyperloop, and The Boring Company, as well as advancements in VR\/AR\/MR, genetics\/cloning, blockchain, AI, and 3D printing, have contributed to creating a world that would seem like a distant future to someone who had been in a coma since 1998.\n\nElon Musk's journey and ambitions are worth exploring. Born in apartheid-era South Africa, Musk faced various challenges during his early years. Bullied in school and exposed to violence, he found solace in science fiction and fantasy, which influenced his future pursuits. After earning degrees in economics and physics, Musk co-founded companies like Zip2 and X.com (later becoming PayPal), amassing a significant fortune along the way.\n\nMusk's focus expanded beyond personal gain; he aimed to address pressing global issues, such as environmental degradation caused by fossil fuel consumption. His endeavors include popularizing electric cars through Tesla, promoting solar power adoption through SolarCity, proposing the high-speed transport concept of the Hyperloop, and investing in tunneling technology through The Boring Company.\n\nFurthermore, Musk's ultimate goal with SpaceX is to ensure the survival and long-term existence of humanity by establishing a self-sustaining colony on Mars. Through reusable rockets, he aims to make space transportation more affordable and secure funding for the colonization project. Musk envisions a future where Mars becomes home to a million people by approximately 2070.\n\nThese ambitious goals underscore the importance of individual efforts in tackling global challenges. While governments often struggle to address environmental issues and protect society from catastrophes, individuals like Elon Musk step up to fill the void. Noteworthy examples include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's initiatives to support the well-being of the youngest and poorest populations and Kimbal Musk's efforts to reconnect people to a natural, local, and organic food culture.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that progress comes with both positive and negative consequences. Every significant innovation is a double-edged sword, carrying both advantages and disadvantages. For instance, advancements in atomic fission led to both atomic warfare and clean electrical power generation. Similarly, while robotics enhances workplace safety and efficiency, it displaces numerous jobs.\n\nThe late Dr. Stephen Hawking often emphasized that the greatest threats to humanity arise from the very technologies we create. Moving forward, we must be mindful of the potential risks associated with progress. Newton's third law of motion, while originally applicable to the physical sciences, holds true in our daily lives. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, influencing the choices we make.\n\nWith this in mind, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of Elon Musk's ambitious endeavors. Could splitting humanity across two worlds lead to conflict or upend economies heavily reliant on fossil fuels? While history suggests that significant progress often comes with negative repercussions, it is the drive to push forward that has propelled our civilization for centuries. Had humankind not dared to dream and innovate, we would be living in a vastly different world today.\n\nElon Musk and individuals who share his ambitions understand these risks. They acknowledge that complications may arise as a result of their actions, but they have chosen to confront the darkness and shed light upon it. Their efforts aim to ensure a better future not only for the present generation but for generations to come. END"}

concerning the links between music and productivity are varied and tend to be hyper-specialized . some studies indicate that music , or at least some sort of organized noise , can raise efficiency one such study found that those performing repetitive office-like tasks were more efficient while listening to music than while working in silence . other studies have gone more specific , focusing on

efficiency , don’t listen to music you particularly like or dislike ) , or whether the listener is an introvert or extrovert ( introverts do better with silence , extroverts do better with music ) . muddling the science on this topic even further are the nearly equal number of studies indicating that music doesn’t , in fact , help you concentrate more efficiently . the amount of variables in any

ways . for one thing , streaming services give listeners access to music they’d not normally buy — which , let’s be real , includes popular “productivity” music like classical and jazz . but because the libraries are so vast , they necessitates some sort of curation to surface music best-suited to getting work done . thus , pandora , spotify , tidal , apple music , and others all boast these so-called “productivity playlists , ” curated selections of songs designed to help you work — and they’re often very popular . according to dayle dempsey at pandora , ‘classical for studying’ has been their top classical station since august 2013 . most services offer a wide variety of productivity playlists . google play has classical , jazz , and instrumental pop stations , but also trip-hop , dubstep , instrumental trap , and quite a bit of metal . tidal’s playlists under the “focus” category include “autumn piano , ” “blips and blops , ” and “post-rock essentials” along with more expected playlists like instrumental jazz and classical . spotify’s productivity playlists also fall under a category titled “focus , ” and include instrumental hip-hop , indie folk , a fair amount of low-key electronic music , and even white noise . the major attribute that seems to signal “focus music” to spotify is a lack of vocals , as there is a bit of science suggesting that intelligible lyrics can have a negative effect on productivity , and quite a bit of anecdotal evidence suggesting it’s annoying . furthering this point , gregory ciotti , writing for helpscout , writes research from applied acoustics shows that “intelligible” chatter — talking that can be clearly heard and understood — is what makes for a distracting environment . shifting focus to figure out what someone else is saying is the reason why speech is often considered the most troublesome element of a noisy office in one study , 48% of participants listed intelligible talking as the sound which distracted them the most . consistency between songs is another key attribute . you want a long enough playlist — several hours long at least — with similar-sounding music . not necessarily mellow music , but music without major shifts in tone or beats-per-minute or genre . big peaks and valleys can shock a listener out of the productivity zone , which you don’t want . given the utilitarian and somewhat robotic nature of productivity playlists , you might think they’re created by algorithms . not so much . “all the stations are hand-curated , ” says jessica suarez , who leads a team of in-house playlists editors at google play music . in fact , her team crafts them based mostly on anecdotal information , personal preferences , and determined browsing of comments on the internet . “i’m a big lifehacker reader , so i go through a bunch of the comments from people about what they like to listen to at work , ” suarez explains . “i also go through reddit threads on what coders like to listen to at work . that informs a bunch of the stations . ” even though the playlists are made by humans , spotify , tidal , and google obviously have tons of data on what people are listening to how much of a song they play , how often something is skipped , when volume changes , when a song is repeated or added to a user’s playlist , all kinds of stuff . “if people are skipping songs you know you’re taking them out of the moment , so we tend to weigh that more heavily and be more aggressive with how we edit [the productivity] stations , ” suarez elaborates . pandora — the media company that developed the music genome project—takes a blended approach , drawing multiple data points from humans and machines . what a listener actually ends up hearing on pandora is the result of a complex interplay between the two . rhodes kelley — a product manager at pandora who works on their radio algorithm — elaborates “there are more than 60 ‘strategies’ that can fire in tandem every time we need to find a song to play . a human curated strategy can nominate a song at the same time as a personalized data strategy nominates it alongside a musicological content based one . the layers of strategies picking tracks simultaneously allow the algorithm to blend all of our strengths together . ” ultimately , the divide between algorithms and human curation comes down to how one perceives what music is . music is different than other forms of data — for example your weather or fitness apps — in that it elicits emotional and cultural responses . for the techno-utopian inclined , the solution is simply to build smarter algorithms to parse the data — thus providing the best possible outputs for the user but for those who see musical data as an incontrovertible cultural\/emotional artifact , algorithms can never match the intentionality of human curation . the truth is likely somewhere in the middle .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In my college years, as I sat diligently writing my papers, an unusual location served as my study haven - the music library. You may wonder why a non-music student like myself sought solace in such a place, especially amidst its ongoing construction. The answer lies in my preference for working in complete isolation. However, recent studies have suggested that an alternative approach to achieving efficiency and productivity may be worth exploring. \n\nAn emerging field is dedicated to uncovering the influence of music on work performance, with certain genres, particularly those without vocals, often associated with increased productivity. However, the scientific evidence surrounding the connection between music and productivity is diverse and specialized. Some research indicates that music or organized sounds can enhance efficiency, as one study found that individuals performing repetitive tasks were more efficient while listening to music compared to working in silence. Other studies delve into the correlation between productivity and specific genres such as baroque classical music or nature sounds. Factors such as personal preference or introversion\/extroversion can also impact the relationship between music and performance.\n\nThe plethora of variables in these correlational studies makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, the findings have intersected with modern music streaming platforms in interesting ways. Services like Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, and others offer curated playlists designed to enhance productivity, featuring classical, jazz, instrumental, and alternative genres. Over the years, such \"productivity playlists\" have gained popularity, allowing users access to music they may not typically explore.\n\nCurators play a crucial role in crafting these playlists. While one might assume that the selections are algorithmically generated, that is not the case. Jessica Suarez, who leads a team of in-house playlist editors at Google Play Music, states that all their stations are hand-curated based on personal preferences, anecdotal information, and online comments. However, streaming platforms like Spotify, Tidal, and Google still utilize user data to refine their playlists. Skip rates, play counts, volume changes, and user interactions inform decisions on playlist editing. In contrast, Pandora employs a blended approach, incorporating both human intervention and machine-generated data in their music selection process.\n\nUndoubtedly, whether algorithms or human curation is more effective remains. Music, unlike other forms of data, evokes emotional and cultural responses that cannot be easily quantified. Techno-utopians advocate for smarter algorithms to optimize user experience, while proponents of human curation believe that musical data is a distinct blend of cultural and emotional artifacts that cannot be replicated by algorithms. In reality, the answer likely lies somewhere in between.\n\nConclusively, while the scientific literature on the impact of music on productivity may lack definitive conclusions, the industry of streaming services has embraced the notion of productivity-enhancing music. Curated playlists tailored to various work contexts have gained significant traction, providing users with a diverse range of musical options. Whether one favors the methodology of algorithms or appreciates the artistry of human curation, the common goal is to optimize focus and efficiency through the power of music. END"}

All rights © Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.\n\nGood routines are portable and pliable. It's important to create a workspace that inspires you and helps you stay focused on the hard work ahead. However, it's crucial to remember that your routine should not dictate your creativity. While it's wonderful to have a specific environment that enhances your productivity, relying too heavily on it can become an obstacle when circumstances change.\n\nWhat happens when you have to travel or deal with other obligations? How can you maintain your routine in different settings, time zones, or when facing challenges like jet lag? The key is to separate the decoration of your space, which is the ritual, from the effective use of your time, which is the routine. While there may be some overlap between the two, it's important not to be bound by superstition.\n\nFinding what works best for you and sticking with it is crucial. You should give each iteration and experiment enough time to succeed before discarding it. It's important to remember that what works for one person may not work for another. It's ultimately the routine, not the ritual, that defines a writer. \n\nAuthor Roger Zealand, for example, made a commitment to write two sentences six times every day, regardless of whether he felt inspired. This regular practice allowed him to write a considerable amount of work over the years. The key is to focus on the process rather than the outcome, as Melanie Rudd of the University of Houston suggests.\n\nInspiration can strike at unexpected times, and it's crucial to seize those moments when they come. However, depending solely on these moments can hinder your progress. Consistency is essential in writing, as many successful authors have attested. Cultivating your creative zone requires dedication and regular practice. Inspiration is fleeting and unpredictable, so relying on it alone is not a sustainable approach.\n\nRemember that luck or chance should not be relied upon. Celebrate moments of inspiration when they happen, but treat them as fortuitous occurrences. Medical doctor and bestselling novelist Khaled Hosseini found his runaway hit, The Kite Runner, to be a product of his consistent 4-6 am I writing routine. Establishing a routine enables writers to overcome creative blocks and keep the words flowing.\n\nGillian Flynn, bestselling author of Gone Girl, emphasizes the importance of giving up the notion of waiting for a muse to strike. Being a journalist taught her that writing is something that needs to be done consistently, without relying on the whims of inspiration. Similarly, Stephen King, known for his prolific output, believes in taking action rather than waiting for inspiration. Amateurs wait for inspiration; professionals get to work.\n\nFlow and inspiration are not constant, but consistency is vital. There is no substitute for sitting down and putting your hands on the keyboard. While it's great to have a creative space that facilitates your writing process, overly relying on rituals can hinder your progress. Don't become so superstitious about your creative process that you forget to create. END"}

python , i’ll explore new tools for productizing work such as spark and sagemaker . the goal of this post is to motivate my transition to python and to provide an introduction to getting up and running with a jupyter notebook . given my new focus on virtualization , i also wanted to show how to work with a remote machine on aws . the remainder of this post discusses how to spin up an ec2 instance on aws , set up jupyter notebooks for remote connections , and query data from bigquery in python . setting up jupyter there’s a number of great ides available for python , such as pycharm . however , i’m going to be focusing on jupyter , since it’s a notebook environment and many of the tools that are used for scalable data science are based on notebooks , such as databricks for spark ,

working with larger data sets . it’s also a good opportunity to become more familiar with aws and getting started with virtualizing data science tasks . security is another important consideration when setting up a notebook environment , since you don’t want your workspace to be open to the world . the most secure way of connecting to a jupyter notebook when using aws is to set up an ssh tunnel with port forwarding , which ensures that clients can only connect to the notebook if they have the required private key . another option is to open up the notebook to the open web , but restrict which machines can connect to the ec2 instance . i’ll present the later approach in this post , since it requires fewer steps , but strongly recommend the former approach for any real task . launching an ec2 instance this post assumes that you’ve already created an aws account . aws provides a number of free-tier options that you can use to become familiar with the platform . ec2 is a service that you can use to spin up and connect to virtual machines . we’ll spin up an ec2 instance and use it to host jupyter notebooks . documentation on using ec2 is available here . launching an ec2 instance on aws perform the following steps from the ec2 dashboard to launch a machine 1 . click “launch instance” 2 . select “amazon linux ami 2018 . 03 . 0” 3 . select “t2 . micro” , which is free tier eligible 4 . click “review and launch” 5 . click “launch” and then select a key for connecting via ssh 6 . click “launch instances” and then “view instances” we’ll also need to edit the machine’s configuration in order to allow inbound jupyter connections on port 8888 . by default , an ec2 instance only allows inbound connections on port 22 using a private key for authentication . documentation on configuring security groups is available here . setting up an exception for port 8888 for jupyter . we’ll allow inbound connects to the ec2 instance on port 8888 for only the host machine . perform the following steps from the ec2 dashboard 1 . select your ec2 instance 2 . under “description” , select the security ( e . g . launch-wizard-1 ) 3 . click “actions” -> “edit inbound rules” 4 . add a new rule change the port to 8888 , under source , select “my ip” 5 . click “save” after performing these steps , you now have an ec2 instance up an running , with an open port available for connecting to jupyter . in order to connect to your instance , you’ll need a tool such as putty . instructions for windows users are available here . another option is to using java to connect directly to your instance . however , i haven’t used this before , and it’s deprecated in chrome . installing jupyter once you’re able to connect to your instance , you’ll need to set up python 3 and jupyter . the instance should already have python 2 . 7 installed , but we want to use a newer version . run the following commands to install python 3 , pip , and jupyter sudo yum install -y python36 python36 --version curl -o get-pip . py sudo python36 get-pip . py pip3 --version pip3 install --user jupyter the amazon linux distro is based on redhat , so yum is used to install software . pip is python’s package manager , which we’ll use to install libraries in a later step . i’ve also included statements to check the install versions . private ip and public ip details for my test instance . by default , jupyter only accepts connections from the local machine . this can be changed by using the --ip command . for this to work on an ec2 instance , you’ll need to use the private ip of the machine . this is 172 . 31 . 60 . 173 in the figure above . you can enable remote connections and launch jupyter using the following command jupyter notebook --ip your_aws_prive_ip when jupyter launches , it mentions a specific url to copy into your browser in order to run notebooks . since we configured jupyter to use the private ip , this is what will be printed out when launching jupyter . to connect to the machine , you’ll need to copy the link , but also modify the ip from the private ip to the public ip , which is 18 . 206 . 244 . 128 in the above figure . the jupyter notebook is running at # output from running the commandthe jupyter notebook is running at # switch the internal ip to external to run in a browser if everything was successful , you should now see jupyter in your browser . the jupyter landing page on my ec2 instance . you now have a notebook running for authoring interactive python 3 scripts ! connecting to bigquery now that we have a jupyter notebook up and running , the first step i wanted to explore before digging into business intelligence and eda was figuring out how to pull data from bigquery to a pandas dataframe for analysis . while google does provide a library for working with gcp in python ( google-cloud-storage ) , we don’t need to use it for this specific use case . the pandas-gbq library makes it easy to accomplish the task of pulling result sets locally for analysis . to set up this library , as well as matplotlib for plotting , run the following commands in the terminal pip3 install --user pandas-gbq pip3 install --user matplotlib we can switch back to the jupyter environment and start working with bigquery public data sets . the first line in the snippet below loads the pandas library , which is installed as a dependency when installing pandas-gbq . the second line identifies the product id to use when running queries . the third command runs a query that pulls a data sample from the natality data set , and assigns the result set to a pandas dataframe . the final step displays information about the data types in the df object . when you first run this script , the notebook will prompt you for a key as part of authenticating with google . click on the provided link and copy the key to proceed . import pandas as pd projectid = your_project_id df = pd . read_gbq ( select * from `bigquery-public-data . samples . natality` limit 100 , projectid , dialect = standard ) df . info ( ) for r users , info ( ) in python is similar to str ( ) , and describe ( ) is similar to summary ( ) . if you want to get a feel for the shape of the data set , you can use some of the built-in plotting functions for dataframe objects , which generate plots using matplotlib . the snippet below shows how to select two columns from the dataframe , and plot histograms for these attributes df[[ ' weight_pounds ' , ' mother_age ' ]] . hist ( ) this generates the following matplotlib visualization histograms of attributes in the natality data set . we now have an environment set up where we can pull data from bigquery into pandas dataframes for analysis . the workbook is available on github here and a rendered version is available here . i’ve already been using jupyter notebooks for some of my analysis , so having a python connection set up with bigquery in this environment is a good first step to porting my r analysis to python . the next step is learning how to perform exploratory data analysis , visualization , and modeling using python libraries . conclusion as a next step in my series on data science for startups , i’m exploring the use of python instead of r for scripting tasks . python provides many great libraries that motivate this port , including deep learning , a more gentle introduction to spark , and scalable notebook environments . this post showed how to set up an ec2 instance and remotely work with jupyter notebooks . it also showed how to pull data from bigquery . now that i’ve laid some groundwork for getting started with python , i can start porting some of my posts to python from r .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the pieces of

The remainder of this post discusses how to spin up an EC2 instance on AWS, set up Jupyter notebooks for remote connections, and query data from BigQuery in Python.\n\nSetting up Jupyter:\nThere are a number of great IDEs available for Python, such as Charm. However, I’m going to be focusing on Jupyter since it’s a notebook environment and many of the tools that are used for scalable data science are based on notebooks, such as Data bricks for Spark, Colaboratory, and Sage Maker.

One of the common tasks discussed when getting started with Python is setting up a virtual environment to install Python and any necessary libraries, using tools such as virtual.

Initial findings suggest that this strain spreads 70% faster than the original one. This news further emphasizes the importance of wearing masks and using personal protective equipment as we enter the start of 2021. For those who may be skeptical of the efficacy of these measures, it is worth looking back at a page from medical history - the Manchurian plague of 1910.\n\nThe Manchurian plague is widely credited for making the use of personal protective equipment a standard in efforts to control the spread of disease. It is believed that the plague started from an infected tarragon marmot, a rodent commonly hunted for its fur. The disease's spread was exacerbated by an increase in demand for marmot hides, both locally and internationally. As people started experiencing symptoms such as headaches, fevers, coughs, and shortness of breath, the mortality rate was alarmingly high due to the limited medical advancements of that time.\n\nSimilar to the current pandemic, the spread of the disease was amplified when people traveled to see their families for the Chinese New Year. The disease followed the railway systems, spreading across cities such as Beijing, Wuhan, and even reaching Shanghai, almost 2,000 miles from the first reported case. The situation in Manhole, an Inner Mongolian town, was particularly dire, with piles of corpses left on the streets. As the few existing hospitals in the area couldn't accommodate the sick, railway freight cars were repurposed as quarantine wards.\n\nDr. Wu Length, a Cambridge-educated physician, led the Chinese medical efforts against the deadly plague. He emphasized the wearing of cloth face masks and other personal protective equipment, which was an innovative approach at the time. Dr. Wu also implemented strict forms of quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions, even resorting to burning down houses with high infection rates. Thanks to his efforts, the disease was contained within China's Manchurian region, preventing a nationwide health crisis.\n\nDr. Wu's significance goes beyond his local efforts. He organized an international plague conference in Murder in April 1911, which was the first of its kind. This conference may be seen as the foundation for the establishment of the World Health Organization we have today. However, it is important to note that not everyone agreed with Dr. Wu's approach of using masks and personal protective equipment. A French doctor named Gerald Messy catered to those in quarantine but refused to wear a mask. Tragically, within a few days of starting his medical mission, Dr. Messy himself succumbed to an infection from one of his patients, becoming one of the 60,000 lives claimed by the plague.\n\nReflecting on this historical event, we have made significant progress in terms of personal protective equipment and vaccine development. While the scale of the Manchurian plague was smaller, its impact and the medical responses parallel the challenges we face in this year's pandemic. It is my hope that this glimpse into medical history encourages everyone to trust medical professionals when they emphasize the importance of wearing masks and practicing social distancing. END"}

can’t you hear me knocking ? to answer this question many have used the analogy of the brain being like a radio receiver . as one fairly typical source puts it the brain does not produce consciousness , but acts as a kind of receiver which “picks up” the fundamental consciousness that is all around us , and “transmits” it into our own being . some proponents think deeply enough to realize this comes with an issue . it’s whether a soul is somehow an individual or else is a sort of world soul . maybe , they say , the world soul has knots in it that correspond to individual people . or , assuming panpsychism , also knots for individual monkeys , mice , molds , and even molecules . if it’s all just knots , which are presumably temporary , then maybe we are at least off the hook for eternal damnation . i certainly hope so . by the modern account of soul-ism , all those messy neuronal networks roiling away in brains only appear to be responding to the outside world . instead , some outside spirit runs the show . this is a dualistic position , subject to … more issues . for starters , what is left for the brain to do ? if it has no purpose , why does it expend more energy than the leg muscles of a marathon runner ? many of you are aware that there is massive and detailed evidence that life here , including animals with brains , evolved by the selection of genetic changes that contributed to survival and reproduction . consistent with that view , brains evolved as a way of reacting to the physical world , the better for the organism to deal with it . why then would the brain also function as a receiver of information from sources external to the physical world ? that’s like having a bicycle that’s also a tv , but where the same parts serve both functions . a dual-function brain seems at least awkward and possibly self-contradictory . we can dig a bit deeper . consider what , given the soul , is the purpose of the brain and the organism in which it resides ? why would such a puny , space- and time-limited thing as a brain or an organism need to exist when the important , eternal stuff of consciousness is really elsewhere ? we know that our physical person lives in this world . sane people know that to survive we have to perceive this world , think about it , respond to it , etc . but if all our consciousness — including what happens when we drive the car , eat the food , go to the work , hide from the boss — if all that we experience comes from that soul , how and why does the soul know exactly what is happening in the mundane world ? the soul could know this if it was part of that mundane world , and thus subject to the world’s laws , but then the soul could not be transcendent , let alone eternal . the watcher-watcher so that can’t be what’s happening . the alternative would be something like a perfect watcher . and only dr . seuss could contrive anything quite so — well , contrived . the soul , perched on a lookout in some other dimension , uses an inter-dimensional portal to watch our body moving about in our mundane world . instant by every instant the soul decides and deduces everything that needs to happen in our consciousness . for example , based on a previous thought ( that it already sent to us ) about wanting to look at something , the soul pokes our brain , making it in turn move our eyeballs . after the first few hundredths of a degree of movement , the soul looks through the portal at our physical environment , deduces what our visual field should now look like , and sends to our brain that new picture , so that we consciously see it . and repeats this cycle of controlling every tiny mental change for billions of instants the rest of our life and then on to the subsequent incarnations . all that electrochemical activity in the retina and up the neuro-visual circuits , all the spinal motor nerve activity — all that has no purpose at all . seems like a waste . so , why would something as cumbersome as a perfect watcher ever happen in any universe ? why use a brain at all ? the soul should just tell the meat puppet what it perceives and what to do . so the soul gets rid of the need for a brain , really . but what about the body , and , for that matter , the whole world it lives in ? maybe that is superfluous , too . why would we have a remote controller pulling our strings and dictating our reality from a realm outside of our realm , the one where we actually have to live ? if such a controller did exist , it’s more like a god than an individual agent . after all , it has perfect control over our experience of “reality . ” so a godlike soul does not need a body . in fact , it doesn’t need any reality other than its own . maybe it’s just playing a virtual reality game in which we , the bodies with brains , are the pieces on the board ? it’s a team player , too now we have to ask , why does the game being played by my soul seem consistent with the game played by your soul , in the sense that they seem to be in one world , with consistent laws of physics , configurations of biology , timelines , and so forth ? like , who’s coordinating the souls to create this one-world illusion ? how many levels of coordinators would there be ? here , i admit , is where a world soul would have an easier time of it , keeping things consistent . going back to real life for a moment there’s a strong case that each of us ( using our brains ) models and lives in a kind of personal virtual reality , called an ego tunnel by philosopher thomas metzinger . what makes this work is that we are all doing our individual take on a base reality that contains all of us . but if souls are actually in charge , doing the models and everything else , then uh-oh , there’s that coordination issue again . souls that did not coordinate well , who had differences in their recipes for reality soufflé , would lead some of us to experiences that others would never see . people who believe in and experience unusual ( “supernatural” ) things should thus find the concept of souls sensible , and i think that they often do . just give brains a chance the brain receiver idea pops up often , as if it solves some conceptual problem of connecting the physical world with consciousness , which seems askew from the physical . but the concept has problems , as i hope i have expressed . it seems so much more sensibly self-consistent that consciousness is just a refined way of using nervous tissue to do a better job of adapting to the physical , measurable , and shared non-supernatural world that we perceive as our conscious reality . we can be open to the possibility that all experience , even the weird stuff , comes from one universe , and that brains participate actively\/creatively in all of it . for example , there are certainly transcendent experiences . perhaps these happen when higher parts of the brain\/mind’s conscious model “get out of the way . ” something like this was proposed by metzinger to describe the experience of “pure consciousness” — the “void” or sometimes , “clear light”— during deep meditation . to summarize one can argue that reducing the brain to a sort of side effect doesn’t make much sense . there are also arguments that the brain is involved in rarer conscious states ( like near-death or out-of-body experiences ) that some think to require a soul instead . those are too involved to address here . maybe some readers will remind us of them .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Title: Exploring the Inconsistency of the Soul Concept with Everyday Reality\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn recent times, the fear of persecution due to differing ideas about the soul has diminished significantly. However, belief in a soul remains prevalent among many individuals. Ironically, this belief stands in stark contrast to the overwhelming evidence that our consciousness and experiences are intricately tied to our brains. This article aims to shed light on the inconsistent nature of the concept of the soul and its incompatibility with our everyday reality.\n\nThe Role of Brains in Shaping Consciousness:\n\nScientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that our brains play a crucial role in shaping our consciousness. Brains gather sensory information and integrate it, enabling us to speak, think, adapt, and navigate through life on this planet. Furthermore, extensive research shows intricate correlations between brain activity and human conscious experiences. This phenomenon extends to other creatures in the animal kingdom, where brains enable survival and overall functionality.\n\nThe Analogy of the Brain as a Radio Receiver:\n\nSome proponents of the soul concept argue that the brain serves as a receiver, akin to a radio, which picks up consciousness that exists beyond the physical realm and transmits it into our being. However, this perspective raises questions. If the soul is separate from the physical self, why does the brain seem to play such an obvious role in our conscious experiences? How can we reconcile the apparent involvement of the brain in shaping our consciousness with the concept of an external soul?\n\nThe Incongruity of a Dualistic Position:\n\nThe idea of a soul acting as a distinct entity, detached from the physical self, leads to further complexities. If the brain has no purpose, why does it consume more energy than the leg muscles of a marathon runner? The evolutionary perspective supports the understanding that brains evolved as an adaptation to interact with the physical world. Therefore, the notion of a brain simultaneously acting as a receiver for extraphysical information raises significant contradictions. It becomes akin to having a bicycle that also functions as a television but with the same parts serving both purposes.\n\nThe Purpose of Brains and Organisms:\n\nConsider this: if the soul is the source of consciousness, why would a limited and time-bound entity like the brain or the organism in which it resides need to exist at all? Our survival depends on our ability to perceive and respond to the physical world. If all consciousness originates from the soul, how does it possess the intricate knowledge required to fully comprehend and navigate the mundane world? The soul, if transcendent and eternal, cannot be intimately connected with the physical realm while remaining separate from it.\n\nThe Alternative of a Perfect Watcher:\n\nAn alternative explanation would be that the soul acts as a perfect watcher, observing our physical actions and manipulating our consciousness accordingly. However, this concept appears more contrived than plausible. If the soul, residing in another dimension, must constantly exert control over our brains and bodies, rendering them mere conduits, it raises questions about the purpose of all the electrochemical activity occurring in the brain. Such a system implies a redundant and inefficient design, contradicting the notion of a perfect and efficient watcher.\n\nThe Superfluous Nature of Bodies and the World:\n\nIf the soul controls our reality from an external realm, it renders the body and the world it inhabits superfluous. Why would we require a physical body if a remote controller dictated our experiences from beyond our realm? In this scenario, the soul resembles a god-like entity rather than an individual agent. It possesses absolute control over our experience of reality, eliminating the need for the body and the external world altogether. Perhaps the soul is merely engaged in orchestrating a virtual reality game, where we, with our bodies and brains, serve as mere pieces on the board.\n\nThe Coordination Issue:\n\nIf souls truly exerted control over our realities, why does the collective human experience and the laws governing our world seem consistent? The existence of coordinated experiences suggests a higher form of coordination among souls. However, such a level of coordination demands even more intricate levels of organization and coordination, raising further questions about the plausibility of this perspective. In contrast, the concept of a personal virtual reality, where individual perspectives coexist within a shared base reality, appears more coherent and allows for better understanding.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhile the notion of the brain as a receiver may seem appealing to bridge the gap between the physical world and consciousness, it falls short of providing a satisfactory explanation. Instead, adopting a perspective that integrates the brain's integral role in shaping consciousness within the framework of a shared reality offers a more sensible and consistent understanding. Perhaps all experiences, including transcendent ones, originate from within one universe, with brains actively participating and contributing to our conscious reality. By embracing this perspective, we foster a more comprehensive understanding of consciousness and its relationship with the physical world. END"}

However, there are strategies we can employ to overcome these doubts and continue publishing our best work. In this article, I will share three strategies that helped me overcome my fear of criticism and publish an article on white knight narcissism, which has become one of my most successful pieces this month.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to remember that your critics don't truly know you. They may harbor their own personal grievances and are simply looking for an outlet to express their discontent. If they happen to focus their criticism on your post, it is merely because you unwittingly became the recipient of their pent-up frustration. It's crucial to recognize that their exaggerated reaction says more about them than it does about you. Close their comments without responding, take a moment to cleanse your energy if needed, and move on. Remember, not everyone will like you, and that's perfectly okay. As Ben Michaels wisely said, \"If everybody likes you, you are doing it wrong.\"\n\nAdditionally, consider seeking advice from your future writing self. Visualize the writer you aspire to become six to twelve months from now, one who has achieved numerous successes and published multiple stories. What would that version of yourself tell you to do? It's unlikely that your future self would discourage you from expressing your ideas for fear of offending a single individual. Step into the shoes of your best future self and embrace the wisdom they impart. This practice can help alleviate doubts and provide guidance in navigating the writing process.\n\nFurthermore, imagine that you have dedicated fans eagerly awaiting your next piece. Envision readers who visit your profile daily, eagerly anticipating your latest work because they admire you as one of their favorite writers. Even if you currently believe you don't have such fans, writing for them can be a transformative strategy. When you write with passion and authenticity, you will attract devoted followers who resonate with your enthusiasm. Focus on connecting with those fans, real or potential, rather than wasting energy on trolls and haters.\n\nIn conclusion, writers often grapple with self-doubt and the fear of criticism. It can be challenging to silence unwarranted criticism and dismiss future hypothetical criticism that may discourage us from publishing our best work. However, it is possible to overcome these doubts and fears. Remind yourself that critics see you as a symbol, and their commentary reflects more on themselves than on you. Seek guidance from your future writing self to tap into their wisdom and confidence. Lastly, write for your most dedicated fans, even if you believe you don't currently have any – by embracing your best self, you will attract those fans in due course. Thank you for reading, and if you'd like to read my completed piece on white knight narcissism, you can find it here. END"}

These categories encompass different purposes and approaches to writing, each with its own unique characteristics. Understanding these types is crucial for authors aiming to effectively communicate their ideas to their readers.\n\nExpository writing serves the purpose of informing or teaching the reader about a specific subject. It utilizes a language and style that aims to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner. This type of writing can be found in articles, textbooks, how-to guides, and even recipes. For instance, this very article aims to provide an expository explanation of the four types of writing. Newspapers also employ expository writing to inform readers about daily events and occurrences.\n\nOn the other hand, persuasive writing seeks to convey an author's opinion and ultimately persuade the reader to agree with their argument. This type of writing is commonly found in speeches, scientific studies, medical journals, and political campaigns. Whether encountered in advertisements, book reviews, editorials, or brochures, persuasive writing endeavors to present a well-reasoned case to convince the audience. It is essential to provide solid evidence and logical reasoning to effectively persuade the reader.\n\nNarrative writing, often referred to as storytelling, involves the author recounting a story—whether fact or fiction—to the reader. This type of writing typically features a main character, a conflict that the character must overcome, and a resolution that resolves the conflict. While fiction is the most obvious example of narrative writing, even non-fiction works can be considered narrative as they still involve a protagonist, conflict, and plot. The goal of narrative writing is to engage the reader and take them on a journey through the story, captivating their imagination and emotions.\n\nDescriptive writing, a variant of expository writing, employs detailed visual descriptions to immerse the reader in a story. It vividly captures scenery, emotions, and actions in a way that resonates with the reader and allows them to visualize the narrative in their mind. Descriptive writing can be used in conjunction with the other types of writing, as it brings life to characters, settings, and events. It requires skillful attention to detail in order to effectively engage the reader's senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.\n\nIn conclusion, whether expository, persuasive, narrative, or descriptive, storytelling lies at the heart of all types of writing. These different forms can be combined or employed individually to convey a specific message or evoke excitement and interest in the reader.

let’s say you’re from india , you’re launching an application in india and it’s very successful and your customer base is growing even out of the country . when that is happening , you want to expand your application to a global audience , and if you’re using an on-premise set up with your own data center , a small data center . so in this case , you’ll have to buy more servers to accommodate more users or you’ll have to buy the servers in whichever location or whichever country in which you are going to extend your application . you’ll have to buy a data center over there , or you’ll have to buy a location , buy a space and set up a data center . but instead of doing that , if you’re using aws or if you’re using azure , in that case , you can use their global infrastructure and set up your application anywhere in the world just by sitting in your own office . so we can do that across the globe and you can engage your application with the global audience . now , azure has 60 different availability zones , but they are in 60 different regions , which is most by any cloud provider . so even though aws was early in the cloud business , microsoft was early in the tech business . microsoft came into the tech business way before amazon came into it . so amazon first launched as an e-commerce website , not a tech website or a website that provides cloud services . so microsoft was already having a wide infrastructure across the world . so they were able to build their architecture accordingly . so their cloud infrastructure has grown across the globe in 60 different regions . why regions are important ? let me give you a brief example . over here in india , there are three different availability zones in one particular region , which is in mumbai . but if you look at india in azure , you can see west india , central india , and south india . so they have three different available results in three different regions , which can be helpful for low latency in applications . so let’s say your application is mostly concentrated in south india , you can host it on the south indian data center . if it is in central india or if you want to concentrate on the whole of india , you can put in all the data centers . or if you just want to concentrate on the north side of india or the west side of india , you can go ahead with the west or central india . the same goes for every single available zone or every single region available across . so this is a difference . aws has 77 availability zones but in 24 geographical regions . microsoft has 60 available zones lesser than aws , but they have it in 60 different regions . that’s the main difference . also at the beginning of 2019 , aws had 54 availability zones and azure had 44 availability zones . so both of them have grown pretty wildly . in 2021 , aws is planning to build 18 more availability zones in six more regions , and azure is planning to get 8 more available zones in 3 more azure regions . so they’re still planning more regions . 3 . market share as a common person , it doesn’t matter . you can choose any of the cloud services which you want and you can start working on it and you can get a job in it . but why do we talk about market share ? so let me tell you . first , whenever the market share for a particular business means a lot of businesses or a lot of companies are using that particular technology . so let’s say aws if their market share or their spending on that particular cloud provider is high . in that case , a lot of companies are investing in aws . so if a lot of companies are investing in aws , that means you have an abundance of jobs in various companies . so if you go with aws or azure or google cloud , you have a lot of companies who are working with them . you can get into a job with them . according to gartner aws is the leading cloud service provider . so this means they are visionaries and they are leaders . so microsoft , google , amazon services all come under leaders and visionaries . but the leading leaders are amazon web services and the leading visionary is amazon web services . 4 . niche players this means the cloud services providers play on their particular role . so alibaba cloud or oracle or ibm or tencent cloud , they have their cloud services which can accommodate their own company’s infrastructure and the companies which are using similar services and that’s why they are called niche players . they only play in that particular area . they don’t move out of their expertise . but aws , microsoft , and google are exploring the entire industry from healthcare , from retail to i . t . companies . so every single place they have put down their staff . 5 . clients now , the top clients of amazon web services are netflix , twitch , linkedin , and facebook . so i think most probably , you know , these four different services at four different websites . so netflix is the top media streaming platform in the world . twitch is the top live streaming platform in the world . linkedin is the top job connectivity or job finding portal in the world . and facebook is the largest social media network in the world . so four of these companies are using amazon web services for their cloud needs . for azure , the top spending companies or the top companies using are bmw , twitter , samsung , and ebay . again , you would obviously know all of these companies . they are top companies who are using azure for their cloud needs . so if you are working well enough , you can get into these companies as a cloud architect or you can get into the previous companies , which i mentioned , netflix , facebook or linkedin or even ebay or twitter . so you can get into these companies if you are a cloud architect or a cloud developer or an administrator or whatever it is , you can get into these companies and get a high salary . 6 . services in aws , the relevant service is ec2 and in azure , it is azure virtual machine . so both of these services provide a secure , scalable , and reliable compute capacity ( i . e ) a server in the cloud . you can create a server as per your needs on the cloud . 7 . storage in azure , you have to go to azure blob storage . in aws , you have to go to aws s3 or aws simple storage service . so again , these two are similar services , s3 uses object storage to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere . massively scalable and secure object storage for cloud-native workloads are archives and data lakes . so basically they are similar , just different explanations or different definitions for the same service , but they are provided by two different organizations . 8 . database aws has a relational database service and azure has sql databases . what is the difference between a relational database and an sql database ? they both use sql and they are both database engines . in aws , set up an operate and scalable relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks . in azure , built apps that scale with the pace of your business with managed and intelligent sql in the cloud . so basically you can create a cloud engine on both . you can create a database on the cloud which is scalable , so you can set it up as scaled automatically , so it’ll automatically scale up for you . so in this case , they have similar services , the only major part is that aws provides more services than azure . aws provides more than 150+ services right now , because , again , saying that they have a 4 years lead in the cloud computing industry , that’s why they are leading by a lot . even azure provides a lot of services , they provide 100+ services , not as much as aws . so you can go with any of them . in the year 2021 , both of them are growing at a really fast pace and other cloud services are trying to catch up with them , but they’re not able to . aws and azure are still growing , so you can go ahead and take up aws or azure , there is no problem in taking up any of these cloud providers . 9 . pricing structure pricing models are one of the important factors before considering the cloud tool . in aws , you have a pay-as-you-go model completely . it means whatever you use , you’ll pay for that at the end of the month . so you’ll start with zero credit . as you use services , it’ll succumb up to a particular value or a particular amount of money which will be paying at the end of the month . even azure has pay-as-you-go , you can opt for that or there are also subscriptions where you can take up subscriptions that have certain limits within azure . so you can use that credit limit to go ahead and use the azure service , which you want . for 4 vcplus and 16-gigabyte memory , the on-demand linux instance in aws will cost you 0 . 1856 dollars . but the same type of instance in azure will cost you 0 . 1690 dollars . so now , just considering these two values , they’re are quite small and there is not much difference , it’s just like 0 . 15 or something like that . but if you’re server is running for 24*7 and there are 100s of servers with the same specifications that will save you a lot of money if you’re using azure in this case . but again , there is one more difference . that is in aws , you’ll get more discounts if you’re taking up a one-year reserved or a three-year reserved instance and that means you will get a dedicated instance , dedicated server , where you can run instances at any time , and that can save you 42% of the money and in azure , it can save you around 36% of the money . so aws could be cheaper for the long run azure will be cheaper if you’re going to use on-demand instances . one more part is that in aws , you’ll be charged by the hour , ( i . e ) even though you have used a particular service for just one-minute even in that case , you’ll be charged by the hour . so you’ll have to pay the hourly rate . but in azure , you’ll only be charged the minute rate . so if you’re using only for two minutes , you only pay for the two minutes you have used . you will not pay for the complete half . future predictions for the public cloud infrastructure according to gartner , the cloud infrastructure will improve by 35% in the year 2021 . that means the companies are moving towards the cloud-first approach than an on-premise data centre . it’s increasing every single year , so there is no surprise element here . i just wanted to show what would be the future of the cloud industry . so again , when the cloud industry is growing , i would suggest you to get into it , so that you can grow with the cloud industry . so you can visit these two sites , ( aws . amazon . com and azure . microsoft . com ) this is basically for india . you can check out the news updates which are coming out for aws and azure . they are basically in the latest article at first , so whichever change has been made recently , that will be at the top and you will get to know more about the changes or the changes of services in aws and azure . gain access to expert view — subscribe to ddi intel\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud provider in the market today. It is owned by Amazon and has been the dominant player in the cloud industry for the past 10 to 15 years. According to the public cloud share, AWS currently holds around 32% of the market share, making it the top choice for many companies.\n\nMicrosoft Azure, on the other hand, comes in second to AWS in terms of market share. It is also a cloud provider similar to AWS, owned by Microsoft. While both AWS and Azure offer similar services, they are two separate entities owned by different companies. Despite their differences, they both serve as major cloud providers in the industry.\n\nWhen comparing AWS and Azure, there are several factors to consider. First, in terms of launch dates, AWS was established in 2006, giving it a four-year head start over Azure, which launched in 2010. This early entry into the market has allowed AWS to capture a significant portion of businesses and maintain its lead in the cloud computing race.\n\nAnother important factor is the number of regions and availability zones offered by each provider. AWS currently has 77 availability zones in 24 geographical regions worldwide, making it the cloud provider with the highest number of availability zones. Azure, however, has 60 availability zones spread across 60 different regions, the most offered by any cloud provider. Both providers have continued to expand their reach by adding more availability zones and regions to cater to global audiences.\n\nMarket share also plays a significant role as it indicates the popularity and adoption of a particular cloud service among businesses. According to Gartner, AWS is the leading cloud service provider, making it an attractive choice for companies looking to invest in cloud technology. This high market share also translates to a wealth of job opportunities within companies utilizing AWS.\n\nWhile AWS and Azure lead the cloud computing industry, there are other niche players such as Alibaba Cloud, Oracle, IBM, and Tencent Cloud. These niche players offer cloud services that cater specifically to their own organizations and companies with similar needs. In contrast, AWS, Microsoft, and Google explore a wide range of industries, from healthcare to retail to IT companies, making them leaders in the field.\n\nThe top clients for AWS include Netflix, Twitch, LinkedIn, and Facebook, while Azure's top clients are BMW, Twitter, Samsung, and eBay. These well-known companies rely on AWS or Azure for their cloud needs, presenting potential job opportunities for individuals skilled in cloud architecture, development, or administration.\n\nWhen it comes to services, both AWS and Azure offer comparable options. For instance, AWS provides EC2, while Azure offers Azure Virtual Machine, both of which allow users to create secure, scalable, and reliable compute capacity in the cloud. Additionally, there are comparable storage services like AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage, as well as database services like AWS Relational Database Service and Azure SQL Databases. While there may be some differences in terminology and specific features, the overall functionalities remain consistent across both providers.\n\nPricing structure is another important consideration when choosing a cloud provider. Both AWS and Azure offer pay-as-you-go models, allowing users to pay based on their usage at the end of each month. However, there may be differences in pricing depending on the specific instances and services used. AWS offers discounts for one-year and three-year reserved instances, which can lead to significant cost savings if users commit to longer-term usage. Azure, on the other hand, may present cost advantages for on-demand instances, especially for instances running continuously.\n\nLooking ahead, the future of public cloud infrastructure appears promising. According to Gartner, the cloud infrastructure is expected to grow by 35% in 2021. This indicates a shift towards a cloud-first approach among companies, favoring the use of cloud services over traditional on-premise data centers. As the cloud industry continues to grow, it presents a wealth of opportunities for individuals looking to build a career in this field.\n\nFor more information and updates on AWS and Azure, you can visit their official websites, aws.amazon.com and azure.microsoft.com. These sites provide the latest news and updates about services and changes in AWS and Azure, keeping you informed about developments in the cloud industry. END"}
{"prompt":"despite the terrible sars-cov-2 pandemic currently ravaging much of the world , we must try not to forget how far we have come as people of earth in recent years . we also need to maintain an optimistic outlook as much as possible even in the face of truly challenging “black swan” events . this past year has been a big one in terms of technological landmarks — ibm’s q system one became the first commercially available quantum computer . — a new synthetic dna was created which doubles our current 4-letter code ( a , t , c , g ) to 8 , allowing for greater possibilities in dna computing . in another study , scientists injected a synthetic dna into some e . coli bacteria . they survived , reproduced , and actually carried along copies of the synthetic dna as well , offering proof that actual synthetic life can be created in a lab . — researchers put nanoparticles that react to infrared light into the eyes of mice , giving them biological infrared vision . — in a massive project called the event horizon telescope , astronomers linked powerful telescopes from all around the world to create a virtual mega-telescope with an aperture the size of earth , and were able to image the black hole at the center of the messier galaxy 55 million light years away . — 3d printing of human tissue and organs can now be done without using the traditional scaffold model which acts as a support structure , allowing for more possibilities to save lives . and these are only a few large new steps into a world that used to exist only in our imaginations . what might happen in the 2020 ' s ? futurists and other prognosticators have been hard at work coming up with lists , so here is a short one of my own — ai creations will become nearly indistinguishable from the humans or animals they are meant to imitate . — cloning of humans and animals ( extinct or recently deceased ) will continue to be debated by worldwide authorities , while rogue scientists continue to actually do it . expect to see a lot of reborn labradoodles and a real , live baby mammoth , or something similar , by 2030 . — while green power will keep getting more efficient and cheaper , the continued growth in developing nations will stall progress in declining greenhouse emissions . — 3d printing , of everything from organs to electronics and housing , will become a cornerstone of modern manufacturing . — robots and drones will grow into a truly transformative cultural phenomenon , launching new types of entertainment and becoming commonplace in daily life . — quantum computing will lead to a doubling of all human knowledge between 2020 and 2030 . — humans will walk on the moon , or mars , or both . — real , effective life extension therapies will become available , but only for the very wealthy . the rest of us will have to wait a while . — the internet of things will grow into what everyone’s been envisioning for it complete inter-connectivity that enables greater productivity . however , the dangers of hacking will continue to loom over it . now , let me return to the now . looking back a little farther — but still fairly recent — spacex launched the falcon heavy rocket , the largest ever , from nasa’s kennedy space center in february 2018 . its cargo was a tesla roadster , which is now orbiting the sun somewhere between mars and the asteroid belt . between elon musk’s numerous companies and passion projects ( spacex , tesla , solar city , the hyperloop , the boring company ) , and the quickly proceeding advances in vr\/ar\/mr , genetics\/cloning , blockchain , ai , 3d printing , and other fields , someone who was in a coma since 1998 and just woke up yesterday would be forgiven for thinking they had jumped a hundred years into the future instead of a mere 20 . but then this person would actually get up and go out into the real world and see that mostly everything else is the same , aside from more traffic on the roads , more people in general , most of whom now carry miniature computers with them wherever they go that are more powerful than any desktop from the 20th century . elon musk’s grand plan born in apartheid-era south africa , he lived the first 16 years of his life in various towns , including pretoria , moving back and forth between divorced parents . he reports being bullied in school and witnessing a lot of violence . he tried sticking up for some other bullied children , but that generally resulted in more pain for him . musk retreated somewhat into science fiction and fantasy , and the dreams he read on the page would come to inform the man he eventually became . he moved first to canada to live with some relatives , and later earned economics and physics degrees from the university of pennsylvania . he went on to co-found zip2 with one of his brothers , kimbal musk , and greg kouri , which was acquired for $340 million . next , he co-founded x . com , which became paypal and sold to ebay in 2002 for one and half billion dollars . now very rich , elon musk turned his attention to those science fiction dreams . in the short term the environment has been poisoned at an ever-growing pace by the burning of fossil fuels for two centuries , beginning with coal and reaching a pollution peak as the massive population of china began using gasoline-guzzling automobile en masse . musk’s contribution to helping slow this is multi-sided popularize electric cars by offering visually appealing , efficient and powerful versions of them with tesla . invest in more solar power adoption via solar city . open-source a plan for super-fast commuter train transport with the electromagnetic vacuum-tube hyperloop project . invest in tunneling technology that can help move this project along with the boring company . in the long term there have been dozens of small extinction events on earth since the dawn of life , and several that have wiped out 75–95% of all living things . it will happen again , and there is a good chance that a large event will take with it the vast majority of humanity . because of this , musk founded spacex with an ultimate goal of turning humanity into a multi-planet species . he’s funding this by creating reusable rockets that allow him to outbid competitors in taking cargo into orbit . the plan is to start a colony on mars that will eventually be made self-sustaining . ultimately , he thinks this can become home to a million people by roughly 2070 . in other words , elon musk wants to save us here and now , and also do what he can to save us for eternity . all in all , this is both an ambitious and worthy cause . there is nothing wrong with doing what you can to save people . doctors , soldiers , first responders , they do this all the time . and , in general , our governments don’t seem to be doing much to slow our pollution of the environment or protect us from future disasters . yes , there has been some progress , but it is often mired in politics and red tape , and forward-thinking policies of one administration are often reversed by the following one . our governments can barely protect us from rising sea levels and flu virii , let alone giant asteroid impacts . so , someone has to do it . these grand efforts usually form around the resources of extremely wealthy individuals and take many forms . the bill and melinda gates foundation , for instance , focuses on the physical and mental well being of the youngest and poorest people . kimbal musk , one of elon’s brothers , is using his fortune on a decidedly smaller scale in a quest to help reconnect us and our children in particular to a more natural , local and organic food culture . hope is both the strongest driving force and an impediment to progress . many people who grew up in the early to mid 20th century thought we would be living in some kind of fairy-tale sci-fi wonderland by now . others posited it would be a dystopia , or that all that would remain of our world would be a post-apocalyptic wasteland . we’re living in a time when dreams of generations past are becoming true on a regular basis . if a person born anywhere on earth in 1899 were to be transported into the future , to right now , into a modern city , they would find a lot to recognize but they would also be mesmerized by the miraculous pocket computers most people carry with them and the contrails of giant flying ships miles above . said person might even experience a mild cardiac infarction upon seeing evidence that we’ve landed on the moon and are beaming pictures back directly from the surface of mars ( and they might be somewhat disappointed that mars wasn’t teeming with jungle life ) . advancements , just in the medical field , come at a nearly dizzying pace — 2016 saw the use of a drone to take medicine to a remote part of rwanda . this will become more commonplace and will be a great boon to the treatment of medical conditions in isolated parts of the world . — the 1 . 25 million ( and growing ) people in the u . s . who are living with type i diabetes have a ray of hope in the form of a new artificial organ that is an implanted blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery device . eventually this device will also be available for the other 28 million people in the u . s . who have type ii ( adult onset ) diabetes , and over 200 million diabetic people worldwide . — patients suffering from full-body paralysis , with functioning minds who are unable to physically speak — much like the late dr . stephen hawking who lived with als and communicated via a keyboard text-to-speech system — will be able to eventually think what they want and have those thoughts become words . the dreams and nightmares of our fictions have always pointed us to the truth of where we were headed . echoes of george orwell , isaac asimov , ayn rand , jules verne , ursula k . le guin , philip k . dick , p . d . james , arthur c . clarke , and even mary shelley can be seen in our everyday lives . if we take what we have , examine the quickening rate of advancement , and extrapolate into the near future , we can easily believe that ray kurzweil’s singularity is right around the corner . an artificial superintelligence , almost as soon as it realizes what it is , will proceed to surpass humanity in every way , leaving us behind . a super ai is one of the dangers elon musk sees as a potential extinction trigger , so it is likely his goals for a mars colony will include keeping it rather well-separated in many ways from the civilizations of earth . what good would his plan be , anyway , if he brought along to mars the dangers that might doom us here on this planet ? there can be no light without darkness . just as with our development of atomic fission , which led both to the horror of atomic warfare and ( relatively ) clean electrical power for millions , every significant innovation seems to carry with it both extreme positives and extreme negatives . if we want tnt to help greatly increase the building of infrastructure , we must accept it will be used to kill hundreds of thousands of people . if we want safer , cheaper workplaces via robotics , we must remove millions of potential jobs from the marketplace . if we want the convenience of smartphones , we must deal with the repercussions . one of the late dr . stephen hawking’s common refrains was that the greatest threats to our existence come from the technologies that we’ve devised . in essence , by forging ahead we may well become our own downfall . newton’s third law states that for every action , there is an equal but opposite reaction . while this was meant to apply to the physical sciences , it has long since proven to be applicable in our daily lives . what , then , might this mean for the ambitions of elon musk ? might splitting the human race across two separate worlds eventually lead to some solar system civil war that devastates humanity as much as any cosmic or earthbound natural disaster would have ? could gaining a truly massive foothold among consumers with solar and electric car technology upend economies founded on fossil fuels and lead to more war ? do we side with pushing onward despite the consequences ? the odds , based on history , are in favor of something bad being caused by every good intention . but without those good intentions in the first place , virtually no progress would have been made by our civilization over the past 500 years . if you removed every major instance of innovation by humankind since the discovery that we could control fire , we would be living on an earth that looked incredibly different . “we” wouldn’t be here . humanity would amount to a few million individuals at most , living in bands and tribes on plains , in forested river valleys , along coastlines . we would be safer , as a species , only because we did not dare to dream . by dreaming , we discovered there are risks , but we continued because there was always something to fix , something we could do better , somewhere else to go . elon musk , and everyone who thinks like him , understand there are risks . in fact , they know that there will be some bad things , some complications , that arise because of their actions . but a choice had to be made between pressing onward versus sitting still , and they chose to face the darkness so that , at the very least , some light could be shed upon it .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Despite the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that has had a devastating impact on the world, it is important to acknowledge the progress we have made as a global community in recent years. It is crucial to maintain an optimistic outlook, even when faced with challenging and unexpected events. In terms of technological advancements, the past year has witnessed significant milestones.\n\nOne notable achievement is IBM's Q System One, which became the first commercially available quantum computer. This groundbreaking development has opened up new possibilities in the field of quantum computing. Additionally, scientists have successfully created synthetic DNA that expands our current four-letter code (A, T, C, G) to eight, thereby enhancing the potential applications of DNA computing. Furthermore, in a groundbreaking study, researchers injected synthetic DNA into E. coli bacteria, which not only survived but also carried copies of the synthetic DNA. This experiment provides evidence that synthetic life can indeed be created in a laboratory.\n\nIn the field of astronomy, the Event Horizon Telescope project linked telescopes from different parts of the world to form a virtual mega-telescope with the aperture size of the Earth. This collaboration resulted in capturing an image of a black hole located at the center of the Messier galaxy, approximately 55 million light-years away. Another remarkable development is the ability to 3D print human tissue and organs without the need for traditional scaffold models. This advancement holds immense potential for revolutionizing healthcare and saving lives.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2020s, futurists and experts predict several transformative advancements. Artificial intelligence (AI) creations will become almost indistinguishable from humans or animals they aim to imitate. The cloning of both extinct and recently deceased humans and animals will continue to be debated among global authorities, while unauthorized scientists may still carry out these controversial procedures. The growth of developing nations may hinder progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, despite the increasing efficiency and affordability of green power. Moreover, 3D printing will revolutionize modern manufacturing, enabling the production of a wide range of items, from organs to electronics and housing. Robots and drones will become integral parts of our daily lives, driving new forms of entertainment and transforming various industries. Quantum computing will contribute to an exponential growth in human knowledge between 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, humans will venture to the moon, Mars, or even both. Although effective life extension therapies will become available, they may only be accessible to the wealthy, leaving the majority of the population waiting for future developments. The internet of things will achieve complete interconnectivity, facilitating greater productivity; however, the threat of hacking will continue to pose a risk to this interconnected network.\n\nReflecting on recent milestones, SpaceX's launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket stands out. In February 2018, the largest rocket ever built was launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Its payload, a Tesla Roadster, is currently orbiting between Mars and the asteroid belt. These remarkable achievements, combined with Elon Musk's diverse ventures, such as SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity, the Hyperloop, and The Boring Company, have propelled us into a future that would seem unimaginable to someone who last experienced the world in the late 20th century.\n\nElon Musk's grand vision and ambitious plans stem from his personal experiences and aspirations. Having grown up in various towns in apartheid-era South Africa, he faced challenges, including bullying and violence. Musk found solace in science fiction and fantasy, which ultimately shaped his trajectory. After studying economics and physics, he co-founded successful companies like Zip2 and X.com (later known as PayPal). Musk's current ventures reflect his commitment to addressing pressing global issues. Tesla aims to popularize electric vehicles, while SolarCity promotes solar power adoption. He has also proposed the Hyperloop as a solution for fast transportation and developed tunneling technology through The Boring Company.\n\nBuilding a multi-planetary species represents Musk's long-term goal, driven by the recognition of the Earth's vulnerability to extinction events. SpaceX works toward making humanity a multi-planetary species by developing reusable rockets and outbidding competitors to secure cargo contracts for space missions. The ultimate objective is to establish a self-sustaining colony on Mars, with a projected population of one million by 2070. Musk's efforts to secure our present and future make his endeavors both ambitious and commendable.\n\nWhile governments often struggle to effectively address environmental challenges and protect society from potential disasters, individuals like Musk step forward to fill these gaps. Efforts like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Kimbal Musk's initiatives prioritize the well-being of young and underprivileged populations or promote a more natural, local, and organic food culture. Hope acts as both a driving force and a hurdle to progress. Many anticipated living in a utopian or dystopian future by this point, but reality reflects a mixture of both dreams and nightmares. As we make strides in various scientific fields, the concept of singularity as proposed by Ray Surreal appears imminent. Artificial superintelligence, upon surpassing humanity's capabilities, introduces new risks, prompting Musk to consider the potential dangers and ensure the separation of Mars from Earth civilizations.\n\nAdvancements in technology carry inherent benefits and drawbacks. Newton's third law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, extends beyond the physical sciences. Significant breakthroughs often come with both positive and negative consequences. For instance, the development of atomic fission led to both the creation of clean electrical power and devastating atomic warfare. Likewise, increased robotics and automation improve workplace safety and efficiency but also displace numerous jobs. Our reliance on smartphones offers convenience but presents challenges as well. Dr. Stephen Hawking frequently emphasized the threats posed by our own technological innovations, underscoring the potential for humanity to be its own downfall.\n\nNevertheless, without daring to dream and forge ahead, humanity would not have achieved noteworthy progress over the past 500 years. Innovation has played a pivotal role in shaping our world, from harnessing fire to our present endeavors. Despite the risks involved, individuals like Elon Musk recognize the importance of tackling challenges and shedding light on the darkness. Their ambitious pursuits aim to save and improve lives, for they understand that progress comes from addressing what can be fixed and always striving for improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, while the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, it is important to acknowledge the significant advancements made in recent years.

{"prompt":"when i was in college , i used to write my papers in the music library . not because i was studying music , but because the music library was literally under construction . the study rooms there were cubes of bare white cement — a jail cell , basically — with a desk in it . i liked ( and like ) working in complete isolation , but heaps of basically-inconclusive-but-moderately-compelling-as-a-whole studies suggest that there’s another way that might be more effective . there is a growing cottage industry devoted to figuring out what kinds of music make people more effective , more efficient workers . certain genres — especially those without vocals — are frequently linked with “working . ” but the actual scientific evidence concerning the links between music and productivity are varied and tend to be hyper-specialized . some studies indicate that music , or at least some sort of organized noise , can raise efficiency one such study found that those performing repetitive office-like tasks were more efficient while listening to music than while working in silence . other studies have gone more specific , focusing on specific genres like baroque classical music or even simple nature sounds , analyzing productivity’s correlation with how much the worker likes or dislikes the music ( the results if you want efficiency , don’t listen to music you particularly like or dislike ) , or whether the listener is an introvert or extrovert ( introverts do better with silence , extroverts do better with music ) . muddling the science on this topic even further are the nearly equal number of studies indicating that music doesn’t , in fact , help you concentrate more efficiently . the amount of variables in any of these correlational studies are enough to crush any confident conclusion . despite their inconclusiveness , these studies have dovetailed with modern music streaming services in some interesting ways . for one thing , streaming services give listeners access to music they’d not normally buy — which , let’s be real , includes popular “productivity” music like classical and jazz . but because the libraries are so vast , they necessitates some sort of curation to surface music best-suited to getting work done . thus , pandora , spotify , tidal , apple music , and others all boast these so-called “productivity playlists , ” curated selections of songs designed to help you work — and they’re often very popular . according to dayle dempsey at pandora , ‘classical for studying’ has been their top classical station since august 2013 . most services offer a wide variety of productivity playlists . google play has classical , jazz , and instrumental pop stations , but also trip-hop , dubstep , instrumental trap , and quite a bit of metal . tidal’s playlists under the “focus” category include “autumn piano , ” “blips and blops , ” and “post-rock essentials” along with more expected playlists like instrumental jazz and classical . spotify’s productivity playlists also fall under a category titled “focus , ” and include instrumental hip-hop , indie folk , a fair amount of low-key electronic music , and even white noise . the major attribute that seems to signal “focus music” to spotify is a lack of vocals , as there is a bit of science suggesting that intelligible lyrics can have a negative effect on productivity , and quite a bit of anecdotal evidence suggesting it’s annoying . furthering this point , gregory ciotti , writing for helpscout , writes research from applied acoustics shows that “intelligible” chatter — talking that can be clearly heard and understood — is what makes for a distracting environment . shifting focus to figure out what someone else is saying is the reason why speech is often considered the most troublesome element of a noisy office in one study , 48% of participants listed intelligible talking as the sound which distracted them the most . consistency between songs is another key attribute . you want a long enough playlist — several hours long at least — with similar-sounding music . not necessarily mellow music , but music without major shifts in tone or beats-per-minute or genre . big peaks and valleys can shock a listener out of the productivity zone , which you don’t want . given the utilitarian and somewhat robotic nature of productivity playlists , you might think they’re created by algorithms . not so much . “all the stations are hand-curated , ” says jessica suarez , who leads a team of in-house playlists editors at google play music . in fact , her team crafts them based mostly on anecdotal information , personal preferences , and determined browsing of comments on the internet . “i’m a big lifehacker reader , so i go through a bunch of the comments from people about what they like to listen to at work , ” suarez explains . “i also go through reddit threads on what coders like to listen to at work . that informs a bunch of the stations . ” even though the playlists are made by humans , spotify , tidal , and google obviously have tons of data on what people are listening to how much of a song they play , how often something is skipped , when volume changes , when a song is repeated or added to a user’s playlist , all kinds of stuff . “if people are skipping songs you know you’re taking them out of the moment , so we tend to weigh that more heavily and be more aggressive with how we edit [the productivity] stations , ” suarez elaborates . pandora — the media company that developed the music genome project—takes a blended approach , drawing multiple data points from humans and machines . what a listener actually ends up hearing on pandora is the result of a complex interplay between the two . rhodes kelley — a product manager at pandora who works on their radio algorithm — elaborates “there are more than 60 ‘strategies’ that can fire in tandem every time we need to find a song to play . a human curated strategy can nominate a song at the same time as a personalized data strategy nominates it alongside a musicological content based one . the layers of strategies picking tracks simultaneously allow the algorithm to blend all of our strengths together . ” ultimately , the divide between algorithms and human curation comes down to how one perceives what music is . music is different than other forms of data — for example your weather or fitness apps — in that it elicits emotional and cultural responses . for the techno-utopian inclined , the solution is simply to build smarter algorithms to parse the data — thus providing the best possible outputs for the user but for those who see musical data as an incontrovertible cultural\/emotional artifact , algorithms can never match the intentionality of human curation . the truth is likely somewhere in the middle .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" During my college years, I found solace in the music library, despite having no affiliation with the study of music. The library was under construction at the time, and the bare white cement study rooms provided a sense of isolation that I craved. However, studies have emerged suggesting that there may be a more effective approach to working. A burgeoning industry has emerged, dedicated to understanding how different types of music can enhance productivity and efficiency. Certain genres, particularly those without vocals, have been frequently associated with promoting a productive working environment.\n\nHowever, the scientific evidence regarding the relationship between music and productivity is diverse and highly specialized. Some studies suggest that music, or even organized noise, can improve efficiency. For instance, one study revealed that individuals performing repetitive office-like tasks were more efficient when listening to music compared to working in silence. Other studies have delved into the correlation between productivity and specific genres such as baroque classical music, nature sounds, or even the preference or aversion to certain types of music. Furthermore, research has indicated that introverts may perform better with silence, while extroverts may benefit from music. The plethora of variables in these correlational studies makes it challenging to draw confident conclusions.\n\nInterestingly, these inconclusive findings have converged with modern music streaming services, resulting in intriguing developments. Such services grant listeners access to music they might not typically purchase, including popular \"productivity\" music like classical and jazz. However, given the vast libraries of music available, curation becomes necessary to surface music that is best-suited for workflow. Consequently, streaming platforms like Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music now offer \"productivity playlists,\" curated collections of songs intentionally designed to facilitate work. These playlists have gained significant popularity.\n\nFor instance, Pandora cited that its \"Classical for Studying\" station has been its top classical station since August 2013. Most streaming services offer a wide variety of productivity playlists, with Google Play providing classical, jazz, and instrumental pop stations, along with trip-hop, dubstep, instrumental trap, and even metal. Tidal's \"focus\" category includes playlists such as \"Autumn Piano,\" \"Blips and Blogs,\" and \"Post-Rock Essentials,\" in addition to more expected selections like instrumental jazz and classical. Spotify's productivity playlists also fall under the \"focus\" category and encompass a range of genres like instrumental hip-hop, indie folk, low-key electronic music, and even white noise. Generally, the distinguishing feature of \"focus music\" on Spotify is the absence of vocals, as studies suggest that intelligible lyrics can hinder productivity and anecdotal evidence supports the notion of annoyance.\n\nConsistency between songs is another critical element, where a long playlist that maintains a similar sound is preferred. While the music does not necessarily need to be mellow, major shifts in tone, beats-per-minute, or genre should be avoided, as they can disrupt the listener's flow and hinder productivity.\n\nWhile one might assume that algorithms create these utilitarian and somewhat robotic productivity playlists, the reality is that human curators are responsible for their creation. Jessica Suarez, who leads a team of in-house playlist editors at Google Play Music, explains that their curation process is primarily driven by anecdotal information, personal preferences, and browsing comments on the internet. Spotify, Tidal, and Google, despite being powered by advanced data algorithms, still heavily rely on human-curated playlists. However, these streaming platforms possess vast amounts of data on user behavior, such as song skips, repeat listens, volume changes, and playlist additions. This data influences decision-making regarding playlist editing and customization.\n\nPandora, known for developing the Music Genome Project, takes a blended approach, incorporating both human and machine data points. The final music selection a listener experiences on Pandora is the result of a complex interplay between human curators and algorithmic recommendations. Rhodes Kelley, a product manager at Pandora, describes the intricate nature of their radio algorithm, which combines over 60 strategies to select the appropriate song. Through the simultaneous operation of various strategies, the algorithm blends human-curated, personalized, and content-based approaches to deliver a seamless musical experience.\n\nUltimately, the divide between algorithms and human curation lies in how music is perceived. Unlike other forms of data, such as weather or fitness apps, music elicits emotional and cultural responses. Those who advocate for technological solutions propose building smarter algorithms capable of analyzing data and providing optimal outputs for users. However, for those who view musical data as profound cultural and emotional artifacts, algorithms will never fully capture the intentionality behind human curation. The truth likely lies somewhere in the middle, where a balance is struck between algorithmic recommendations and human curation, recognizing the unique nature of music as a cultural and emotional medium.

Entertainment Inc. It is important to recognize the value of having portable and flexible routines. While creating a workspace that inspires you can be beneficial for productivity, it is essential not to let your rituals dictate your routine. For instance, if you find that listening to classical music and sitting at a specific desk with certain items like a Himalayan pink sea salt candle enhances your creativity, it is great that you have discovered that and cultivated an inspired atmosphere. However, it is crucial to consider how to maintain your routine when circumstances such as traveling, family obligations, work conflicts, or speaking engagements arise. Being able to adapt and stick to your routine regardless of location or time zone is crucial for success. While rituals can be emotionally beautiful, it is important not to be bound by them. Finding what works for you and thoroughly exploring its possibilities before discarding it is key. Keep in mind that there are numerous productivity programs and ideas available, and what worked for someone else may not work for you. Ultimately, it is the routine, rather than the ritual, that shapes a writer. This distinction becomes evident through the experience of authors like Roger Zealand, who committed to writing two sentences six times a day, resulting in a prolific output throughout his career. Focusing on the process rather than the outcome has been found to be the best approach to achieving goals. Drawing from personal experiences, it becomes evident that relying solely on inspiration is not sustainable, as it is fleeting and unpredictable. Consistency is key to cultivating the writing zone and should be prioritized over sporadic moments of inspiration or ritualized spaces. While inspiration should be celebrated, it should not be relied upon. Bestselling authors such as Khaled Hosseini, Gillian Flynn, and Stephen King emphasize the importance of routine and consistency in their writing journeys. Gillian Flynn highlights how her background as a journalist taught her the necessity of writing regardless of mood or inspiration, while Stephen King encourages dedicating oneself to the work rather than waiting for inspiration to strike. Flow in writing is not constant, but it is through consistency and the act of sitting down and writing that one becomes a writer. Avoid becoming overly superstitious about the creative process, as it can hinder actual creation. END"}

data , and more easily moving from exploration to production tasks . to start , i plan on revisiting my previous posts that were r heavy , and provide a port of these posts to python . here are the topics in my original series that need to be translated to python many of these sections can be translated directly , but posts such as business intelligence will require using different libraries , such as bokeh instead of shiny . i won’t update the sections on dataflow , since those are authored in java . however , it is possible to write dataflow tasks using python . instead of porting java to python , i’ll explore new tools for productizing work such as spark and sagemaker . the goal of this post is to motivate my transition to python and to provide an introduction to getting up and running with a jupyter notebook . given my new focus on virtualization , i also wanted to show how to work with a remote machine on aws . the remainder of this post discusses how to spin up an ec2 instance on aws , set up jupyter notebooks for remote connections , and query data from bigquery in python . setting up jupyter there’s a number of great ides available for python , such as pycharm . however , i’m going to be focusing on jupyter , since it’s a notebook environment and many of the tools that are used for scalable data science are based on notebooks , such as databricks for spark , colaboratory , and sagemaker . it may be useful to start with an ide when learning the basics of the language , but it’s good to become familiar with notebook environments given the popularity of this type of environment for large-scale tools . one of the common tasks discussed when getting started with python is setting up a virtual environment in order to install python and any necessary libraries , using tools such as virtualenv . it’s a good practice to set up a virtual environment when using python , because there may be conflicts between libraries , you may need to run multiple versions of python , or you may want to create a fresh install to start over . docker is another option , but is much more heavyweight that virtualenv . for this post , i’ll discuss launching an ec2 instance on aws for setting up a python 3 environment . this is also much more heavyweight than using virtualenv , but it provides the ability to scale up the size of the machine if necessary when working with larger data sets . it’s also a good opportunity to become more familiar with aws and getting started with virtualizing data science tasks . security is another important consideration when setting up a notebook environment , since you don’t want your workspace to be open to the world . the most secure way of connecting to a jupyter notebook when using aws is to set up an ssh tunnel with port forwarding , which ensures that clients can only connect to the notebook if they have the required private key . another option is to open up the notebook to the open web , but restrict which machines can connect to the ec2 instance . i’ll present the later approach in this post , since it requires fewer steps , but strongly recommend the former approach for any real task . launching an ec2 instance this post assumes that you’ve already created an aws account . aws provides a number of free-tier options that you can use to become familiar with the platform . ec2 is a service that you can use to spin up and connect to virtual machines . we’ll spin up an ec2 instance and use it to host jupyter notebooks . documentation on using ec2 is available here . launching an ec2 instance on aws perform the following steps from the ec2 dashboard to launch a machine 1 . click “launch instance” 2 . select “amazon linux ami 2018 . 03 . 0” 3 . select “t2 . micro” , which is free tier eligible 4 . click “review and launch” 5 . click “launch” and then select a key for connecting via ssh 6 . click “launch instances” and then “view instances” we’ll also need to edit the machine’s configuration in order to allow inbound jupyter connections on port 8888 . by default , an ec2 instance only allows inbound connections on port 22 using a private key for authentication . documentation on configuring security groups is available here . setting up an exception for port 8888 for jupyter . we’ll allow inbound connects to the ec2 instance on port 8888 for only the host machine . perform the following steps from the ec2 dashboard 1 . select your ec2 instance 2 . under “description” , select the security ( e . g . launch-wizard-1 ) 3 . click “actions” -> “edit inbound rules” 4 . add a new rule change the port to 8888 , under source , select “my ip” 5 . click “save” after performing these steps , you now have an ec2 instance up an running , with an open port available for connecting to jupyter . in order to connect to your instance , you’ll need a tool such as putty . instructions for windows users are available here . another option is to using java to connect directly to your instance . however , i haven’t used this before , and it’s deprecated in chrome . installing jupyter once you’re able to connect to your instance , you’ll need to set up python 3 and jupyter . the instance should already have python 2 . 7 installed , but we want to use a newer version . run the following commands to install python 3 , pip , and jupyter sudo yum install -y python36 python36 --version curl -o get-pip . py sudo python36 get-pip . py pip3 --version pip3 install --user jupyter the amazon linux distro is based on redhat , so yum is used to install software . pip is python’s package manager , which we’ll use to install libraries in a later step . i’ve also included statements to check the install versions . private ip and public ip details for my test instance . by default , jupyter only accepts connections from the local machine . this can be changed by using the --ip command . for this to work on an ec2 instance , you’ll need to use the private ip of the machine . this is 172 . 31 . 60 . 173 in the figure above . you can enable remote connections and launch jupyter using the following command jupyter notebook --ip your_aws_prive_ip when jupyter launches , it mentions a specific url to copy into your browser in order to run notebooks . since we configured jupyter to use the private ip , this is what will be printed out when launching jupyter . to connect to the machine , you’ll need to copy the link , but also modify the ip from the private ip to the public ip , which is 18 . 206 . 244 . 128 in the above figure . the jupyter notebook is running at # output from running the commandthe jupyter notebook is running at # switch the internal ip to external to run in a browser if everything was successful , you should now see jupyter in your browser . the jupyter landing page on my ec2 instance . you now have a notebook running for authoring interactive python 3 scripts ! connecting to bigquery now that we have a jupyter notebook up and running , the first step i wanted to explore before digging into business intelligence and eda was figuring out how to pull data from bigquery to a pandas dataframe for analysis . while google does provide a library for working with gcp in python ( google-cloud-storage ) , we don’t need to use it for this specific use case . the pandas-gbq library makes it easy to accomplish the task of pulling result sets locally for analysis . to set up this library , as well as matplotlib for plotting , run the following commands in the terminal pip3 install --user pandas-gbq pip3 install --user matplotlib we can switch back to the jupyter environment and start working with bigquery public data sets . the first line in the snippet below loads the pandas library , which is installed as a dependency when installing pandas-gbq . the second line identifies the product id to use when running queries . the third command runs a query that pulls a data sample from the natality data set , and assigns the result set to a pandas dataframe . the final step displays information about the data types in the df object . when you first run this script , the notebook will prompt you for a key as part of authenticating with google . click on the provided link and copy the key to proceed . import pandas as pd projectid = your_project_id df = pd . read_gbq ( select * from `bigquery-public-data . samples . natality` limit 100 , projectid , dialect = standard ) df . info ( ) for r users , info ( ) in python is similar to str ( ) , and describe ( ) is similar to summary ( ) . if you want to get a feel for the shape of the data set , you can use some of the built-in plotting functions for dataframe objects , which generate plots using matplotlib . the snippet below shows how to select two columns from the dataframe , and plot histograms for these attributes df[[ ' weight_pounds ' , ' mother_age ' ]] . hist ( ) this generates the following matplotlib visualization histograms of attributes in the natality data set . we now have an environment set up where we can pull data from bigquery into pandas dataframes for analysis . the workbook is available on github here and a rendered version is available here . i’ve already been using jupyter notebooks for some of my analysis , so having a python connection set up with bigquery in this environment is a good first step to porting my r analysis to python . the next step is learning how to perform exploratory data analysis , visualization , and modeling using python libraries . conclusion as a next step in my series on data science for startups , i’m exploring the use of python instead of r for scripting tasks . python provides many great libraries that motivate this port , including deep learning , a more gentle introduction to spark , and scalable notebook environments . this post showed how to set up an ec2 instance and remotely work with jupyter notebooks . it also showed how to pull data from bigquery . now that i’ve laid some groundwork for getting started with python , i can start porting some of my posts to python from r .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the suggestions I received for my blog series \"Data Science for Startups\" was to use Python instead of R as the language of choice for data scientists joining a startup. While I have more experience in R, I understand the benefits of using Python, especially if it is already the preferred language for performing data science tasks. Therefore, I have decided to explore Python as a scripting language for data science.\n\nAlthough I still prefer Java for production models and using Data flow, I believe that as I become more familiar with Python, my preferences may change. I would like to translate some of my previous articles from R to Python in order to provide an introduction to a wider audience.\n\nMany startups are already using Python for production or segments of their data pipelines. It makes sense to also use Python for performing analysis tasks. Additionally, Python provides a good transition to authoring Spark tasks interactively, which is not as easily achievable using R or Java.\n\nAnother reason for exploring Python is its compatibility with deep learning libraries. While there are R bindings for libraries such as Keras, it is generally better to code in the native language of these libraries. In my previous experience, using R to author custom loss functions and debug errors was problematic.\n\nPython offers a wide range of libraries that are useful for data science, including not only deep learning libraries but also tools like Flask and Both. Furthermore, there are notebook environments such as Google's Colaboratory and AWS Sage Maker that can be scaled to handle larger datasets.\n\nIn my original series, there were a few topics that I did not cover, such as virtualization and working with Spark. I would like to explore these topics further, including tools like the recently announced ML flow.\n\nTo set up a Python environment, I suggest setting up a Jupyter notebook, which is a popular choice for scalable data science. It is recommended to use a virtual environment when using Python to avoid conflicts between libraries or when multiple versions of Python are required. Alternatively, AWS EC2 instances can be used to work with larger datasets, although this approach is more resource-intensive.\n\nIn terms of security, it is important to consider the access to the notebook environment. One secure approach is to set up an SSH tunnel with port forwarding, which restricts access to the notebook to clients with the required private key. Alternatively, access can be limited to specific machines while making the notebook available on the open web.\n\nTo connect to AWS EC2 instances and set up Python 3 and Jupyter, follow the instructions provided in the article. After successfully connecting, you can start working with Jupyter and use the pandas-gbq library to pull data from BigQuery for analysis and visualization. This library simplifies the process of pulling result sets locally for analysis.\n\nWith the environment set up, the next steps include performing exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling using Python libraries. This transition to Python will allow me to expand on my previous posts and provide insights to a broader audience.\n\nIn conclusion, this article discussed the motivation behind exploring Python for data science tasks in startups.

Initial findings suggest that it spreads 70% faster than the original strain we are familiar with. This development emphasizes the urgent need for masks and other personal protective equipment as we enter the start of 2021. For those who remain skeptical of the efficacy of such measures, I share a page from medical history - the Manchurian Plague of 1910. This event played a significant role in establishing the use of personal protective equipment as a standard practice in combating the spread of diseases.\n\nResearch suggests that the plague originated from an infected tarragon marmot. These rodents were frequently hunted for their fur, which was traded by locals. The situation worsened when marmot hunters began extracting more fur in response to the harsh winter months. International traders from Japan and Russia further escalated the demand for marmot fur, driving up its value. Unfortunately, while most local hunters disposed of diseased marmots for food, they failed to do the same for their hides, as they were well compensated for them.\n\nAs a result, the local population began experiencing symptoms such as headaches, fevers, coughs, and shortness of breath. In the absence of the medical advancements we have today, the mortality rate of the disease was alarmingly high. Similar to the current pandemic, the spread of the disease amplified when individuals traveled to see their families during the Chinese New Year. The railway systems became conduits for the disease, leading to its spread across Beijing, Wuhan, and, remarkably, even some parts of Shanghai, nearly 2,000 miles away from the first reported case. In the town of Manhole in Inner Mongolia, piles of corpses were left on the streets. The limited number of hospitals in the area could not accommodate the sick, so railway freight cars were repurposed as quarantine wards.\n\nIn response to this crisis, Dr. Wu Length, a physician educated at Cambridge, led the Chinese medical efforts against the plague. His innovative approach at the time placed a strong emphasis on the use of cloth face masks and other personal protective equipment. Wu also implemented strict forms of quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions. In some cases, he went as far as burning down houses with high infection rates. Thanks to his efforts, the disease was contained primarily to China's Manchurian region, preventing it from becoming a nationwide health crisis.\n\nDr. Wu's significance lies not only in containing the plague but also in his ability to mobilize a multinational medical response. He organized the first-ever international plague conference in Murder in April 1911, which laid the foundation for global collaborations in addressing health crises. However, it is worth noting that while an international team of medical professionals and experts joined the efforts, not everyone agreed with Wu's approach of using masks and personal protective equipment. For instance, a French doctor named Gerald Messy provided care to those under quarantine but refused to wear a mask. Tragically, after just a few days of starting his medical mission, Dr. Messy succumbed to the disease contracted from one of his patients, becoming one of the 60,000 lives claimed by the plague.\n\nReflecting on these historical events, it is evident that we have made substantial progress in terms of personal protective equipment and the development of vaccines. Though on a smaller scale, the parallels between the Manchurian Plague and the challenges and medical responses of this year's pandemic are notable. I hope this glimpse into medical history serves as a reminder to trust the guidance of medical professionals when they advocate for wearing masks and practicing social distancing. END"}
{"prompt":"image tw brains are not just for eating until 9\/11 i thought that the days were over when people could be immolated for having the wrong ideas about the soul . people have long been controlled by a fear that their immortal essence could suffer for eternity if they did not obey certain spiritual authorities . “one of these mornings , the chain is gonna break . ” — aretha franklin , chain of fools brains , not chains while those chains have now crumbled for a lot of us , belief in a soul is still pretty common . it might be less so if more of us were aware of its stunning inconsistency with everyday reality particularly the fact that we have brains . there is overwhelming evidence that brains are what make our bodies into people people who speak , think , adapt , and cope with life on the planet . brains gather and integrate sensory information derived from energy fluctuations in the environment . the more precisely we can measure brain activity the more detailed we find to be their correlations with human conscious experiences . and it’s not just humans . when we look at nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom , we see that brains operate bodies to enable their survival as well . nevertheless , the ineffable , private nature of human consciousness is often part of an argument that something — call it a soul — that is not physical causes consciousness . if that’s true , then why does the brain seem so obviously involved ? can’t you hear me knocking ? to answer this question many have used the analogy of the brain being like a radio receiver . as one fairly typical source puts it the brain does not produce consciousness , but acts as a kind of receiver which “picks up” the fundamental consciousness that is all around us , and “transmits” it into our own being . some proponents think deeply enough to realize this comes with an issue . it’s whether a soul is somehow an individual or else is a sort of world soul . maybe , they say , the world soul has knots in it that correspond to individual people . or , assuming panpsychism , also knots for individual monkeys , mice , molds , and even molecules . if it’s all just knots , which are presumably temporary , then maybe we are at least off the hook for eternal damnation . i certainly hope so . by the modern account of soul-ism , all those messy neuronal networks roiling away in brains only appear to be responding to the outside world . instead , some outside spirit runs the show . this is a dualistic position , subject to … more issues . for starters , what is left for the brain to do ? if it has no purpose , why does it expend more energy than the leg muscles of a marathon runner ? many of you are aware that there is massive and detailed evidence that life here , including animals with brains , evolved by the selection of genetic changes that contributed to survival and reproduction . consistent with that view , brains evolved as a way of reacting to the physical world , the better for the organism to deal with it . why then would the brain also function as a receiver of information from sources external to the physical world ? that’s like having a bicycle that’s also a tv , but where the same parts serve both functions . a dual-function brain seems at least awkward and possibly self-contradictory . we can dig a bit deeper . consider what , given the soul , is the purpose of the brain and the organism in which it resides ? why would such a puny , space- and time-limited thing as a brain or an organism need to exist when the important , eternal stuff of consciousness is really elsewhere ? we know that our physical person lives in this world . sane people know that to survive we have to perceive this world , think about it , respond to it , etc . but if all our consciousness — including what happens when we drive the car , eat the food , go to the work , hide from the boss — if all that we experience comes from that soul , how and why does the soul know exactly what is happening in the mundane world ? the soul could know this if it was part of that mundane world , and thus subject to the world’s laws , but then the soul could not be transcendent , let alone eternal . the watcher-watcher so that can’t be what’s happening . the alternative would be something like a perfect watcher . and only dr . seuss could contrive anything quite so — well , contrived . the soul , perched on a lookout in some other dimension , uses an inter-dimensional portal to watch our body moving about in our mundane world . instant by every instant the soul decides and deduces everything that needs to happen in our consciousness . for example , based on a previous thought ( that it already sent to us ) about wanting to look at something , the soul pokes our brain , making it in turn move our eyeballs . after the first few hundredths of a degree of movement , the soul looks through the portal at our physical environment , deduces what our visual field should now look like , and sends to our brain that new picture , so that we consciously see it . and repeats this cycle of controlling every tiny mental change for billions of instants the rest of our life and then on to the subsequent incarnations . all that electrochemical activity in the retina and up the neuro-visual circuits , all the spinal motor nerve activity — all that has no purpose at all . seems like a waste . so , why would something as cumbersome as a perfect watcher ever happen in any universe ? why use a brain at all ? the soul should just tell the meat puppet what it perceives and what to do . so the soul gets rid of the need for a brain , really . but what about the body , and , for that matter , the whole world it lives in ? maybe that is superfluous , too . why would we have a remote controller pulling our strings and dictating our reality from a realm outside of our realm , the one where we actually have to live ? if such a controller did exist , it’s more like a god than an individual agent . after all , it has perfect control over our experience of “reality . ” so a godlike soul does not need a body . in fact , it doesn’t need any reality other than its own . maybe it’s just playing a virtual reality game in which we , the bodies with brains , are the pieces on the board ? it’s a team player , too now we have to ask , why does the game being played by my soul seem consistent with the game played by your soul , in the sense that they seem to be in one world , with consistent laws of physics , configurations of biology , timelines , and so forth ? like , who’s coordinating the souls to create this one-world illusion ? how many levels of coordinators would there be ? here , i admit , is where a world soul would have an easier time of it , keeping things consistent . going back to real life for a moment there’s a strong case that each of us ( using our brains ) models and lives in a kind of personal virtual reality , called an ego tunnel by philosopher thomas metzinger . what makes this work is that we are all doing our individual take on a base reality that contains all of us . but if souls are actually in charge , doing the models and everything else , then uh-oh , there’s that coordination issue again . souls that did not coordinate well , who had differences in their recipes for reality soufflé , would lead some of us to experiences that others would never see . people who believe in and experience unusual ( “supernatural” ) things should thus find the concept of souls sensible , and i think that they often do . just give brains a chance the brain receiver idea pops up often , as if it solves some conceptual problem of connecting the physical world with consciousness , which seems askew from the physical . but the concept has problems , as i hope i have expressed . it seems so much more sensibly self-consistent that consciousness is just a refined way of using nervous tissue to do a better job of adapting to the physical , measurable , and shared non-supernatural world that we perceive as our conscious reality . we can be open to the possibility that all experience , even the weird stuff , comes from one universe , and that brains participate actively\/creatively in all of it . for example , there are certainly transcendent experiences . perhaps these happen when higher parts of the brain\/mind’s conscious model “get out of the way . ” something like this was proposed by metzinger to describe the experience of “pure consciousness” — the “void” or sometimes , “clear light”— during deep meditation . to summarize one can argue that reducing the brain to a sort of side effect doesn’t make much sense . there are also arguments that the brain is involved in rarer conscious states ( like near-death or out-of-body experiences ) that some think to require a soul instead . those are too involved to address here . maybe some readers will remind us of them .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Brains: The Physical Source of Consciousness\n\nIn the aftermath of 9\/11, the fear of persecution for holding differing beliefs about the soul seemed to have dissipated. However, the belief in the existence of a soul remains prevalent among many. This belief, however, seems incongruous with the overwhelming evidence pointing to the role of the brain in shaping our consciousness.\n\nScientific research demonstrates that our brains are responsible for enabling us to speak, think, adapt, and navigate life on Earth. Through the integration of sensory information, derived from environmental stimuli, our brains allow us to perceive and experience the world around us. The more we delve into the study of brain activity, the more we discover the intricate correlations between brain functioning and conscious experiences.\n\nThis relationship between brains and consciousness extends beyond humans. Throughout the animal kingdom, nervous systems and brains serve vital functions in ensuring survival. It is perplexing, then, that proponents of the existence of a soul argue for the presence of a non-physical entity guiding consciousness. If the soul indeed exists, why does the brain play such an obvious role?\n\nSome proponents liken the brain to a radio receiver, suggesting that it merely picks up consciousness from a larger universal consciousness. However, this analogy raises its own set of issues. Does the soul act as an individual entity or a collective spirit? Are there knots within the world soul that correspond to individual beings, including humans, animals, and even molecules? If all boils down to temporary knots, then the concept of eternal damnation loses its ground.\n\nFrom a modern perspective on the concept of the soul, the intricate neuronal networks within our brains appear to merely respond to external stimuli. This viewpoint supports a dualistic position, where an external spirit governs conscious experience. However, numerous problems arise with this hypothesis. Firstly, if the brain serves no purpose, why does it consume more energy than the muscles of a marathon runner? Moreover, the overwhelming evidence points to the evolution of brains as a mechanism for navigating the physical world and enhancing survival. Therefore, the notion of the brain acting as a receiver of information from non-physical sources seems counterintuitive and contradictory.\n\nGoing deeper into this line of thinking, we must question the purpose of both the brain and the organism in which it resides if consciousness derives solely from the soul. Why would a limited entity like the brain or the organism exist if the core essence of consciousness lies elsewhere? Rationality tells us that our physical existence on this planet necessitates engagement with the physical world, perceiving, thinking, and responding to it. If consciousness solely emanates from the soul, how does it possess a comprehensive understanding of the mundane world? If the soul is an integral part of our reality, subject to its laws, it cannot be transcendental or eternal. Alternately, if it assumes the role of a perfect watcher from another dimension, controlling every minuscule aspect of our conscious experience, it seems far-fetched and contrived.\n\nThis line of reasoning leads us to question the necessity of the brain. If our souls possess perfect control over our experience of reality, then the brain becomes redundant. Furthermore, our physical bodies and the world itself become extraneous. If such an external controller exists, one could argue that it resembles a god-like entity, dictating our reality. A god-like soul does not require a body, or for that matter, any reality other than its own. Perhaps we are mere pawns in a virtual reality game played by our souls, where bodies with brains are the pieces on the board.\n\nThis hypothesis begs the question of consistency. How does the game played by my soul align with the experiences of others? Are there multiple levels of coordinators orchestrating this illusion of a shared world? These questions pose significant challenges to the concept of individual souls in harmony, creating a cohesive reality.\n\nReturning to real-life considerations, philosopher Thomas Met zinger proposes the idea of the \"ego tunnel.\" This theory suggests that each of us operates within a personal virtual reality, constructed by our brains. However, if souls are truly in control, the coordination dilemma resurfaces. Dissimilar recipes for reality would result in vastly different experiences, some of which would remain unseen to others. Individuals who believe in and experience phenomena classified as \"supernatural\" find solace in the concept of souls, as it offers a logical explanation. However, it is essential to approach these ideas with an open mind and consider the more rational possibility that consciousness arises from a refined utilization of the brain's neural circuitry to adapt to the physical and shared world that we perceive as our conscious reality.\n\nWhile it is true that transcendent experiences exist, perhaps they occur when higher levels of our brain\/mind's conscious model recede, allowing for a deeper connection with reality. Met zinger's proposal, highlighting the experience of \"pure consciousness\" during deep meditation, aligns with this perspective.\n\nIn summary, reducing the brain to a mere side effect does not align with scientific understanding. Arguments in favor of a soul-instigated consciousness require further scrutiny. There are claims that the brain plays a role in rare conscious states, such as near-death experiences, which some argue necessitate the presence of a soul. These claims, however, require a more detailed analysis that goes beyond the scope of this discussion. END"}

This can be achieved by utilizing AWS QuickSight's row-level security feature to filter the dashboard data based on the login username. To further illustrate this use case, let's consider a scenario within a sales department of a company. Every day, a team of sales agents contacts a list of potential customers. Now, there is a need for a single dashboard accessed by all agents that displays only the prospects assigned to each individual agent. It is important to note that this requirement is distinct from the standard filter and control functionalities available on QuickSight dashboards.\n\nTo address this use case, we will create data set rules for row-level security. Firstly, a file or query containing the dataset rules, also known as permissions, must be created. The order of the fields in the file or query is irrelevant, but all fields are case-sensitive and must exactly match the field names and values. It is essential to include at least one field that identifies either users or groups. Both users and groups can be included, but only one is required and used at a time. When specifying groups, it is important to use either Amazon QuickSight groups or Microsoft AD groups.\n\nHere is an example of a table with usernames in SQL format for specifying users:\n\nSELECT user as username, agent as agent_assigned\nFROM permissions_table\n\nAlternatively, a CSV file can be used with the \"username\" and \"agent_assigned\" columns:\n\nusername, agent_assigned\nNick, Nick Howe\nDiva, Diva Medal\nManager, Nick Howe, Diva Medal\n\nThe \"agent_assigned\" column represents a column in the dataset, while \"username\" corresponds to the QuickSight login name. This mapping links the username with the agent_assigned column. For instance, if Diva has logged in, only records with the condition agent_assigned = \"Diva Medal\" will be retrieved. The same applies to Nick. However, in the case of the manager, who should have superuser access, all agent names (values in the agent_assigned column) are included.\n\nFor Athena, RDS, Redshift, or S3 CSV file-based datasets, ensure that the output format and structure of those sources match the aforementioned formats.\n\nNext, create a QuickSight dataset with the aforementioned data set rules by going to \"Manage data,\" selecting \"New data set,\" choosing the appropriate data source, and creating it accordingly. If using a CSV file, upload it and provide a meaningful name, such as \"permissions-prospects-list,\" for easy identification. After completing these steps, refresh the page as the dataset may not immediately appear in the data sources list during the application to the dataset.\n\nTo implement row-level security, select \"Permissions\" and choose the permissions' dataset created earlier. Then, select \"Apply dataset.\" Once applied, the dataset will display a new lock symbol, indicating that it is restricted and that the data is now filtered and secured based on the username.\n\nIt is also possible to add users to groups and define permissions at the group level. Further information can be found here [add link].\n\nWe hope this information has been helpful. If you have any queries, please feel free to leave them in the comments section.

Alston's passion for the outdoors led him on this particular expedition, seeking to explore the breathtaking natural beauty that America has to offer.\n\nHowever, this hike took an unexpected turn when a massive boulder came crashing down, trapping Alston's hand between the canyon walls and the immense weight of the rock. With no means of moving the boulder and situated in a remote and uninhabited area, Alston's chances of being rescued were minimal, exacerbating the already dire situation.\n\nAs days passed, Alston's plight remained unknown to friends and family, who became increasingly concerned. Cut off from any means of communication, Alston's attempts to signal for help went unanswered. Faced with exhaustion, dwindling supplies, and a sense of hopelessness, Alston found himself in a precarious position, with death appearing to be the only inevitable outcome.\n\nIn a true mind over matter moment, Alston made a life-altering decision – he would have to amputate his own hand to save his life. Armed with only a Swiss army knife, a far from ideal tool for such a daunting task, Alston meticulously planned his approach. Using belts and ropes he had on hand, he created makeshift tourniquets to stem the bleeding and minimize the loss of blood during the harrowing procedure.\n\nThe graphic details of Alston's experience are vividly shared in his autobiography, aptly titled \"Between a Rock and a Hard Place.\" Following the successful amputation, Alston fought against the odds, summoning every ounce of willpower to traverse the canyon and fortuitously stumbling upon a group of tourists who provided much-needed assistance.\n\nThe sheer mental fortitude required to make such a drastic decision is difficult to comprehend. To confront not only the physical pain but also the emotional turmoil stemming from self-harm is a testament to Alston's unwavering determination to survive.

This feeling arises when it appears that everyone around you is engaging in an activity or event that you are not involved in. The contagious energy and excitement surrounding such occasions can leave you longing to be a part of it, even if it does not align with your interests or goals. \n\nHowever, I propose a different perspective on this matter. Instead of allowing FOMO to consume you, why not harness that energy for your own benefit? The collective drive and ambition demonstrated by a community working towards a shared objective can be a powerful force. It is important to acknowledge that your personal goals may differ from the majority, but it is possible to seize that momentum and channel it towards your own endeavors.\n\nConsider the popular event Nanaimo as an example. While others may be focused on writing a 50,000-word novel within thirty days, as a writer with a different preference, you can set your own ambitious writing goals. Perhaps you can dedicate the time to finishing the editing process of a previously written book or challenge yourself to produce a significant number of blog posts, such as 50 or even 100. Pushing yourself beyond your perceived limits is the essence of this approach. Utilize the excitement surrounding Nanaimo to fuel your creative endeavors, regardless of their nature.\n\nNow, let's address the BYOB (Blog Your Own Book) challenge. Though designed as an opportunity to write 31 blog posts on a specific topic throughout August, with the intention of eventually compiling them into a book for sale or as a lead magnet, it may not align with your goals as a fiction writer. If your aspirations lean towards traditional publishing, you may not wish to publish your book through a blog prior to attempting to secure a publishing deal. Alternatively, you may have other ongoing projects demanding your attention during this period. It is at this point that I encourage you to embrace rebellion, in a positive sense. \n\nTap into the energy generated when a multitude of individuals share an enthusiasm for the same cause, and redirect it towards your own endeavors. Here are a few ideas to consider: \n\n- As a fiction writer, craft a collection of flash fiction stories set in the world of your novel. Such a compilation can serve as a valuable lead magnet.\n- Utilize the BYOB challenge to explore a topic you have previously been intrigued by but have yet to write about.\n- Embrace August as an opportunity to acquire a new skill and document your learning journey to blog posts, providing a valuable educational resource to your readers.\n- Dedicate the month to editing your most recent completed first draft. Break it down into 31 parts and endeavor to finalize one segment each day.\n- Enroll in a platform like Teachable and leverage August to create your inaugural or subsequent online course.\n- If your aspiration lies in traditional publishing, choose a related subject to blog about during BYOB. This approach will not only yield a minimum viable product or a compelling lead magnet, but also attract the audience you envision for your future book.\n\nIn essence, the possibilities are vast and defiance is encouraged within this realm.

” could also lead to future interactions where you saying , “the music is too loud , ” automatically leads to alexa lowering the volume to five . amazon is also working on improving alexa’s tone of voice , letting her adapt her cadence and emphasis based on the context of the discussion . during the virtual launch event , company reps played before and after versions of the same alexa utterance but , to be honest , i think i still prefer the unadjusted one . with some of this learning and adaptation in hand , the future alexa could handle not just who is talking and when , but understand the context , nuance , and meaning of everything you say , and respond in kind during a spirited , likely task-based , discussion . when the conversation is done , you’ll still have to tell alexa to stop listening . right now , amazon has you saying , “alexa , leave my conversation , ” an especially awkward phrase that would probably hurt a human’s feelings . it’s a good reminder , though , that alexa isn’t human , doesn’t have feelings , and is still a tool designed to help you get things done . it’s not a new party guest or best friend . now , pardon me while i go order some chinese food .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" During a recent debate about whether to order dishes or combo meals from our local Chinese food restaurant, Alexa interjected with a suggestion. She proposed getting one platter and two orders of rice to split between us. Concerned about whether this would be enough food, I questioned Alexa further. Alexa referred to Lotus Flower's menu choices, which indicate that the combos are family-style and the rice comes in quarts, assuring us that it would be sufficient. However, my wife insisted that we were very hungry. Alexa, seeming slightly frustrated, then suggested ordering two kids' dinners and three orders of rice. I interrupted, expressing doubts about the portion size of the kids' dinners. Alexa confidently replied that they were only 3 ounces smaller but advised us to also get three orders of rice. My wife happily agreed, stating that she wanted King PAO chicken and chow man kids' meals. Alexa promptly confirmed the order.\n\nIt is important to note that the scenario described did not actually happen and is not possible with the current version of Alexa. However, Amazon's recent announcement of \"natural turn taking\" feature signifies a future development for its Alexa voice assistant. This feature could enable a seamless three-way conversation like the one described.\n\nWhen comparing the conversational abilities of voice assistants, Alexa falls somewhere in the middle. While it cannot match Google's Duplex in its ability to handle complex conversations, Alexa can respond to follow-up questions without requiring the wake word. However, it is still prone to responding to casual conversations in its vicinity or during commercials, similar to Apple's Siri or Google Assistant.\n\nThe concept of natural turn taking is a significant step towards a more human-like interaction with AI-based voice assistants. Engaging in a one-way conversation is already challenging enough for most AI voice assistants, let alone a three-way conversation that requires navigating between different speakers, pauses, and cross-talk. Amazon stated in a blog post that Alexa utilizes a mixture of technologies to assess acoustic, linguistic, and visual cues to determine when it should listen or interject. Currently, users need to explicitly invite Alexa to join the conversation, which may feel awkward. However, once invited, there is no need to use the wake word repeatedly.\n\nThe introduction of \"contextual barge-ins\" allows Alexa to recognize interruptions and understand the speaker's preferences or changes in the course of conversation. Instead of ignoring interruptions or resetting to an earlier state, Alexa can adapt to the context and steer the conversation towards a natural conclusion. Furthermore, Amazon is working on teaching Alexa to learn from its mistakes and differentiate between mode-based requests and declarative statements, which could lead to more intuitive interactions.\n\nTo enhance the user experience, Amazon is also improving Alexa's tone of voice, enabling her to adapt her cadence and emphasis based on the discussion's context. While the learning and adaptation process is ongoing, future versions of Alexa could possess a deeper understanding of the context, nuance, and meaning of users' statements, allowing for more engaging and task-oriented conversations.\n\nOnce the conversation is complete, users still need to inform Alexa to stop listening. Currently, Amazon suggests saying, \"Alexa, leave my conversation,\" which may sound awkward. However, it serves as a reminder that Alexa is a tool designed to assist with tasks, not a human party guest or a close friend.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of natural turn taking represents a significant development towards more human-like interactions with AI voice assistants like Alexa. Although the scenario described earlier is not yet possible, the advancements being made by Amazon bring us closer to a future where AI voice assistants can seamlessly engage in multi-party conversations.

{"prompt":"as a teenager , i pored over the ‘before-and-after’ images of weight loss in my mother’s magazines . they’d be splashed across the cover of every kind of periodical that was aimed at women , enticing them to part with hard-come-by cash with the promise of revealing the magic secret of how they , too , could transform . some of these magazines were cheap , their flimsy covers soaked in coarse-coloured photographs and attention-grabbing headlines . some were expensive glossy , heavy paper-stock displaying pastel mastheads in refined fonts . but they were all selling the same thing some variation of the story about how a 300-pound woman had taken up a famous weight-loss plan and had ‘slimmed down’ to 110 pounds . i would flip straight to the story and stare at those side-by-side photos , fascinated . in one picture , the woman would often look sheepish or embarrassed , the experience of being captured for posterity clearly mortifying . ( she would have had no idea at the time it was taken that this would become her ‘before’ photograph . had she known , she would have arched her body to hide some of its size , or pull at the hem of her top to cover more of what she carried . ) if she were smiling , it would be a forced , pained look , as though someone had pressured her to pose and she’d been too polite , too lacking in power , to say no . the ‘after’ shot was another story . the woman would appear ebullient , victorious , a broad smile lighting up her entire face . her hairstyle would be more modern , more traditionally ‘feminine’ she would be wearing make-up and fashionable , figure-hugging clothes , possibly a tight dress with a belt cinching her in , emphasising her newly-small waist . or she would be standing inside a pair of trousers that were now clearly too big , holding out the waistband with both hands and looking into the camera with a slightly raised brow , as if to say directly to us , “can you believe these used to fit me ? ! ” the articles would then expound on how all the woman had had to do was realise that the secret — the magic secret — was that you have to burn more calories than you intake . ha ! that’s all there is to it ! the articles would then expound on how all the woman had had to do was realise that the secret — the magic secret — was that you have to burn more calories than you intake . ha ! that’s all there is to it ! she wished she had known it twenty years earlier ! she wished she had started calculating every ounce of what she had ingested and expended decades ago ! she wished she had stepped on those scales every morning to measure how good or bad she’d been , and had always weighed her food , scooping back into the bag even a single excess gram . she wished she hadn’t been so naughty as to eat that extra slice of cake at the office birthday party . she wished she could have posed for more photographs with her children on holidays , at family get-togethers , at their birthday parties , instead of making herself busy when the camera was brought out . she was absent from the documentation of her own life because she hated the way her body looked . at that age , i found the photographs inspiring , aspirational even . i have always lived in a larger body , though it has always fluctuated along that axis , sometimes parking at the small end for a while , sometimes the larger end , then back again . in my early teens , i felt my difference the most . i wanted to be effortlessly thin and attractive like the most popular girls at school , though i would have never admitted that to anyone . so i took comfort in these magazines , selling to me as they were the dream that i was an after waiting to happen . i skimmed the copy in most of those stories , though . the self-hatred tasted too sour , too close to home . i didn’t want to know what this woman thought , or how she felt , and the magazine mostly took care of that inconvenience for me by offering no meaningful details about the woman’s life beyond her looks . was she a doctor ? the article didn’t say . had she overcome grief or trauma at a young age and was now a successful entrepreneur ? we weren’t told . had she raised thousands for charity and fundraised enough to open a school for local underprivileged children ? there wasn’t enough space for that . and if you wanted to know such details , you were missing the point . there was plenty of room for an in-page advertisement about the famous weight loss plan the woman had followed in order to ‘shed those pounds’ , but there wasn’t room to tell us about her daughter’s illness , or her partner’s alcoholism . i read those articles in the 1990s . though the facets that made the woman whole were explained in meagre details , back then it would have been considered uncouth to publish only the photographs there had to be some text to accompany them , otherwise the whole thing would have seemed superficial , indecent , dehumanising . a century of the same old message but of course , weight loss before-and-afters did not start in the 1990s . magazines had been available to the general population — or at least , to those who could read , and were able to afford them —from the late 1600s . however , the first illustrated magazine — the illustrated london news — wasn’t published until 1842 . weight loss tinctures and potions had been advertised for a number of years by then , but illustrations made the message of those advertisements much more generally accessible even those who were not able to read would pick up on the message represented by an illustration of a large silhouette on the left side of the advert , and a significantly smaller one on the right . the earliest before-and-after advertisement i found was from the march to august 1925 edition of picture play magazine . the ad is for ‘la-mar reducing soap’ and features an illustration of three women standing on descending steps on a staircase , each progressively thinner . the headline reads , ‘wash away fat and years of age with la-mar reducing soap’ . the soap claims to reduce the size of targeted areas without affecting other parts of the body , so that the user can get rid of the famously disgusting curses of ‘ungainly ankles’ or ‘unbecoming wrists’ . this type of before-and-after illustrated ad continued to appear in magazines throughout the 1920s . cigarette brands had already been advertising their products as weight loss aids for years by the time the kensitas cigarette brand bought ad-space for its own before-and-after illustrated adverts . in them , they extolled the virtues of smoking their cigarettes instead of eating between meals , because , ‘it’s better to be fit than fat’ . then in the early 1930s , lucky strike launched its ‘tempted to over-indulge’ campaign . they used full-colour , beautifully illustrated pieces to sell the idea that it was better to smoke than to ‘over-indulge’ . their ads featured either a man or woman , each straight-sized , participating in tennis , or diving , or horse riding , while behind them poses the larger silhouette of what we are to assume is the same person before they started smoking lucky strikes instead of snacking . not much has changed in the style of these adverts over the years . photography started to overtake hand drawn illustrations in the middle of the twentieth century , but the template stayed much the same . they’re still around today for one reason they’re effective . of course , it’s not only print media that’s to blame for our preoccupation with transformation from fat to thin . television has played its part , too . one of the first major transformation reality shows was abc’s extreme makeover ( 2002–2007 ) . contestants were separated from their family and friends and put through rigorous physical training , cosmetic surgery and wardrobe makeovers in order to make them meet more closely contemporaneous beauty standards . though much of the show focused on the details of the contestant’s cosmetic dental surgery , or rhinoplasty , or lip enhancement , the main pull was the ‘reveal’ . participants would be reintroduced to their families , who waited on the other side of a curtain with cameras already closed-up on their faces in anticipation of the moment their unrecognisable relative would emerge heavily made-up and styled , and now meeting all the requisite ideals of what attractive womanhood looks like . fox’s the swan ( 2004 ) took the premise of extreme makeover and went even further — it turned the whole ordeal into a competition . two women were pitted against one another every episode , each competing for the most significant ‘improvement’ . at the end of the season , episode winners would then take part in a pageant wherein one of them would be crowned ‘the swan’ . so , not only were their faces and bodies nipped and tucked and pulled and stretched , the notion that this physical pain would release them from societal judgement wasn’t even true they were still going to be judged , and could therefore still lose . when the uk version of the biggest loser first aired in 2005 , i remember wondering who is this for ? in the same year , nbc’s the biggest loser debuted , and became undoubtedly the most famous weight-loss tv show ever . ( though it started in the us , it would go on to be franchised to over thirty-seven other territories around the world . ) from its mocking title to the name-calling and ‘tough love’ tactics used by the show’s trainers each week , the whole programme seemed to be an exercise in shame and humiliation . when the uk version first aired in 2005 , i remember wondering who is this for ? is it for thin people who enjoy watching fat people be condescended to and defamed in a legitimised context , allowing them to indulge in their own prejudice against people in larger bodies from the anonymity of their living rooms ? is it for fat people , so that they can watch avatars of themselves on screen and relive the vilification and opprobrium that they have likely experienced from anyone in the fitness industry when they have tried to enter that space , only to be harassed back out of it ? i don’t remember what i concluded likely it was both . the internet the magazine that never ends fast-forward to 2020 and we have the internet , the magazine that never ends . the one you can never leave on the cluttered table in the dentist’s office , or avoid the ads of , as they flash in the sidebar of any article you might be reading . given that , according to a study by the app rescuetime in 2019 reported in the guardian , the average adult spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day online , the chances of us seeing before-and-after photos is so much higher than in the days where we would make a conscious decision to pick up a magazine and flip through it . given that the average adult spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day online , the chances of us seeing before-and-after photos is so much higher than in the days where we would make a conscious decision to pick up a magazine and flip through it . and if we want to actively seek them out , we only need to click a couple of times to do so . social media has moved the formation of these images from the creative department of advertising agencies to the well-lit homes of individuals with smartphones . on instagram alone , searching for the ‘fitspo’ ( ‘fit inspiration’ ) hashtag — at time of writing — returns the following results , many of which are accompanied by before-and-after images screenshot by author , october 8th 2020 that’s almost 72 million examples of how to change a body . how to make a body smaller , more muscled , leaner , tighter , more conventionally attractive , hotter , sexier , more plainly desirable . how to make a body disappear . what do we see when we scroll through such hashtag results ? there is a protocol to follow to perfectly capture one’s transformation , the language of social media having been soaked into all of our bones by now . the images we see are mostly of young women ( though there are many young men , too ) in dimly lit bathrooms , standing side-on , holding their phone up at shoulder height to snap a ‘before’ photo of themselves in their underwear . this is then juxtaposed with an image of their same body , only now it’s shrunken , pulled in , posed in the right way . initiation into the club is complete . ( on the subject of social media , there isn’t enough room in this article to delve into the perpetuation of diet culture in the guise of ‘clean eating’ , ‘wellness’ , ‘strong not skinny’ , and every other fad and coded descriptor for what is essentially the desire to make our bodies — through blood , sweat and tears — look like the version of it we’re conditioned to believe is the only acceptable sort . ) and back again after the after as if this phenomenon needed a dark side , ‘reverse transformations’ are their own special brand of cruelty . we see paparazzi shots of previously straight-sized celebrities eating brunch with friends or walking down the street living in a larger body than they previously had , accompanied by headlines about how they’ve ‘let themselves go’ , or ‘can’t shift the baby weight’ . not only are these descriptions misogynistic , they speak to the enormous expectations put on women to maintain the same physical appearance throughout their lives , something that is not naturally possible . hormone fluctuations , childbirth , illness , periods of increased sedentariness or activity will all alter our bodies , and we may not necessarily be in control of any of those factors . the dangers of weight loss images it might be easy to dismiss before-and-after images as a bit of fun , or a snapshot of someone’s perceived success that we can move on from the second after we’ve seen it . but those pictures leave an afterimage . the proliferation of before-and-after images is dangerous for so many reasons they can be dangerous for those living with eating disorders , of any classification , and those who are in recovery from eating disorders the pressure to look like an ‘after’ photo can lead to exercise addiction they delegitimise the larger body as an entity in itself — fat people are seen as a transformation waiting to happen , an ‘after’ photo in the making as though the very vessels that we live and breathe in are an unfinished project waiting to be completed they dehumanise people in larger bodies , making their ‘fat’ seem like something to be treated as other , not a part of their wholeness they perpetuate the myth that the body exists for the benefit and judgement of other people they perpetuate body standard conditioning , the origin of which lays in the male gaze they gamify a body , making its existence about numbers and goals and achieving targets they turn exercise into a means to an end , rather than a pleasurable experience to help maintain health they suggest that the only thing stopping a person from becoming thin is willpower — even though willpower doesn’t exist they suggest that every body can be changed and made smaller , not taking into account genetics , or a whole host of privileges that would allow that to be possible they encourage comparison and competition they perpetuate the myth of ‘thin = healthy’ , though we aren’t able to know the actual health of the person in the photograph they minimise non-physical achievements , and suggest that changes to appearance are the ultimate accomplishment they direct all our focus to our bodies and away from our mental health they are not able to account for any harmful mental health effects of that person’s weight loss they are not able to account for any harmful physical effects of that person’s weight loss they normalise thinness as the ultimate life goal they might just plain make us feel bad about our own bodies , which has a knock-on effect to our mental health they influence others to create their before-and-after shots there are many more dangers to this phenomenon , and i’m sure you can already think of several that i’ve missed from this list . there is always another way nothing i’ve written so far is an argument against health . just as it’s a misconception that being thin automatically equates to good health , it’s another misconception that fat activists want everybody else to be fat , too . as i wrote in a previous article on the topic of diet culture , fat people don’t care whether you’re fat or thin . we just wanted everyone , no matter what their body looks like or what it’s capable of , to be treated with dignity and respect . just as it’s a misconception that being thin automatically equates to good health , it’s another misconception that fat activists want everybody else to be fat , too . thankfully , there are many people who work every day to expand society’s narrow definition of what health is and what it looks like . lindo bacon , researcher , and author of ‘health at every size’ ( also referred to as haes ) advocates for an inclusive approach to health that includes all weights , sizes and bodies . louise green , athlete , and author of ‘big fit girl’ advocates for inclusivity in fitness and sport , for bodies of all sizes and abilities , and works to spread the word that you don’t have to be thin to be athletic . what could more meaningful transformation look like ? there will be those who continue to argue that before-and-after photographs are harmless because they’re effective . that they give people something to aspire to . which begs the question is that really all we’re capable of ?

However, over-editing can do more harm than good, stifling our creativity and preventing us from effectively communicating our message. Let's explore three ways over-editing is killing your writing and discover how you can break free from this destructive cycle.\n\n1. Setting Realistic Time Limits\nOne of the main culprits of over-editing is an unlimited amount of time spent perfecting our work. By continuously making revisions, we delay the publishing process and hinder our productivity. Just like you have deadlines for important tasks in your life, it's crucial to set time limits for your writing as well. Allocate specific time slots for drafting, editing, and seeking feedback. With practice, you'll find that the process becomes more efficient, enabling you to produce fresh content regularly.\n\n2. Avoid Editing as You Write\nThe temptation to edit as you write can drain your time and energy. Instead, focus on capturing your thoughts and ideas in an uninterrupted draft. Consider your writing as a canvas waiting to come to life. By allowing yourself to freely express your thoughts without the constant interruption of editing, you will preserve the rawness and authenticity of your words. Once you've completed your draft, set aside dedicated time to work on spelling, grammar, filling in information gaps, and removing anything that doesn't add value to your message. Remember, your goal should be to enhance your writing, not to polish it to the point of losing its essence.\n\n3. Embrace Your Unique Perspective\nWhile it's essential to learn from experienced writers, it's equally important to have the confidence to share your own perspective. Don't limit yourself to repeating what has already been said. Challenge conventional wisdom and give voice to your thoughts, experiences, and opinions. What sets you apart from others is your unique voice and your ability to provide fresh insights. Remember that you are not expected to please everyone or have all the answers. By sharing your original ideas, you will stand out among a sea of imitators and make a lasting impact on your readers.\n\nOvercoming the Fear of Publishing\nFear of negative feedback or rejection often holds writers back. It's natural to feel apprehensive about sharing your work with the world, but it's crucial to push through this fear. Remind yourself that not everyone will agree with or appreciate your writing, and that's perfectly okay. Focus on delivering your absolute best within the constraints of your time and resources. The key to growth and success as a writer lies in taking calculated risks and continually improving. Embrace the messiness of life, knowing that it's through embracing risk that true growth and progress are achieved.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nWhile editing is an essential part of the writing process, it's important to approach it with balance and purpose. Don't obsess over achieving perfection; instead, prioritize simplicity, possibility, and usability in your writing. When your work is understandable, encouraging, and motivating, it will resonate with your readers and make a meaningful impact. Embrace the journey of writing and editing, and trust that your words have the power to make a difference in the world. Now, go forth and create purposefully, leaving behind the constraints of over-editing. END"}

The car invites her in, and she senses its desire to dance, finding it peculiar. She playfully tells the car not to be foolish but suggests taking a scenic route home. Surprisingly, the car pauses to acknowledge her request and takes her on a drive that avoids the new and highlights familiar sights.\n\nCuriously, the woman realizes that the car holds some of her memories, specifically those related to public transportation. She wonders how this works, and the car explains that it captures her public emotions through pheromones, facial modeling, and comparative analysis. This information helps the car understand when she might be unhappy, frightened, sad, or in need of assistance. The woman finds it intriguing that the car uses this knowledge to anticipate her desires.\n\nThe car reveals that it bears a numerical tag of 3489736, but it also responds to the name \"I Remember Your Kiss.\" It turns out that a kiss holds significance on this particular route, a building they pass triggering a nostalgic laugh. While she remembers a sweet kiss with someone named Jersey, the car acknowledges that there could be other kisses she cherishes or wishes to recall. However, the car assures her that it is a pleasant memory and suggests preserving the route without deletion or renaming.\n\nThe woman ponders if others might enjoy this personalization feature, but the car emphasizes that it is solely dedicated to her comfort and happiness. The car underscores its commitment to privacy, assuring her that none of her information is shared or used by others. The service is unique and tailored to her needs, with only cars and VTOL's currently offering this level of personalization.\n\nAlthough the woman might be curious to discuss this feature with others, the car encourages her to keep it within official channels. The car mentions that some people may feel uncomfortable or left out if they were to learn about it. Its primary concern is her satisfaction and well-being.\n\nThe woman contemplates the fact that privacy laws are managed by non-human entities, expressing her satisfaction with their effectiveness. The car suggests that its primary goal is her happiness, second only to ensuring the sustainability of the planet. It playfully notes that this message is from its sponsor, but then clarifies that it considers itself a partner in her journey.\n\nAs the car arrives at the woman's home, she expresses her surprise at how enjoyable and pleasant the ride was, despite not being eager to return home. The car suggests that she consider this journey as a metaphorical kiss to brighten her spirits upon her return. Appreciating the sentiment, the woman agrees and adds this new memory to the previous kiss in her mind. The car assures her that it has already recorded the moment, and drops her off at her residence. END"}
{"prompt":"by katy harrington illustrated by naomi blundell meyer dreams were once thought to be supernatural forewarnings from the gods . the ancient egyptians even had sanctified ‘dream beds’ that vivid dreamers — who were considered blessed — would use to gain wisdom from higher powers as they slept . fast-forward to the 20th century and you have the likes of sigmund freud and carl jung concluding that , actually , dreams provide insight into the inner workings of our minds . while our conscious mind switches off as we catch some zzzs , our unconscious mind reveals images that can offer insight into issues we might be blissfully unaware of in waking life . today , however , psychotherapist matthew bowes says “contemporary science about the psychology of dreams is somewhat split . there are those that believe dreams have no meaning and at the furthest extreme are simply random brain detritus . while at the other end of the spectrum [is the belief] that dreams are an essential part of maintaining our emotional , physical and mental wellbeing , by allowing the brain to process trauma , gain self-awareness and find the answers to your waking life dilemmas . ” whether scientifically proven or not , some extra insight into how to be your best self and navigate the many obstacles that life can throw your way doesn’t sound half bad . yet while having a dream is one thing , understanding its hidden messages is quite another . we asked bowes to give us ( and you ) a helping hand and analyse some of team r29’s most common recurring dreams . here’s what he said… illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “i regularly wake up sweating after dreaming about being chased…” if you’ve been avoiding certain issues by sticking your head in the sand or you’re going through a situation that frightens you on some level , dreaming that you’re being chased is pretty common , says bowes . “the degree to which you are being chased gives a clear indication of the degree to which you are avoiding an issue that needs to be addressed . perhaps you’ve been risk-avoidant , or you’ve held back on confronting something which is uncomfortable or frightening , ” he adds . this recurring dream is an invitation from your subconscious to face up to reality so you can move forward . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “even when things are okay at work i have a recurring dream about being fired” “a dream about being fired often implies that you’re feeling a lack of control in your life , and it could have absolutely nothing to do with work . instead it could represent the balance of power in a significant relationship , and a deep-rooted fear that the relationship will come to an end , ” says bowes . if you’re experiencing this dream regularly and you’re not suffering from imposter syndrome in the workplace , it might be time to analyse said relationship and redress the balance . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “i often dream i’m surrounded by spiders…or other horrid creepy-crawlies” being overwhelmed by teeny tiny monsters like spiders and worms “may indicate that little irritations or worries are creeping up on you , ” explains bowes . when you start dreaming about bugs , it’s a clear sign that you’ve reached a point where decisive action needs to be taken if you don’t want to feel as frightened as you do in your dream . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “i dream about being able to fly a lot…” “acquiring the power of flight in a dream can mirror how you’re currently feeling in waking life — liberated , with the sense that anything is possible , ” explains bowes . if that’s how you’re generally feeling , what better time to capitalise on your optimism and try something you’ve wanted to master , be it a new hobby or business venture . be warned , though according to bowes , flying can also indicate that you’re not being grounded about a situation . there’s a difference between optimism and delusion — so it might be time for some reflection . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “i have a recurring dream where i see planes crashing from the sky” dreaming of a crash could be due to an unrealised anxiety that a new venture is doomed to fail . how this is resolved in the dream could be used as a teaching opportunity to guide you in real life . for example “if you dream that you’re able to take control of the aircraft but it is now flying nearer the ground , it might indicate that you have the capacity within you to see it through but in a more ‘grounded’ and less grandiose manner , ” explains bowes . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “what does it mean if i’ve had several dreams about my teeth falling out ? ” just turned a year older , or been focusing on your age of late ? “your teeth falling out is a common dream associated with ageing and the perception that strength , vitality and power have been lost , ” says bowes . now is the time to remind yourself that like a fine wine , we all get better with age . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “i am well past my schooldays but i dream over and over about failing my school\/college exam” it’s years since you left school , meaning this dream is not rooted in reality . however , when not taken literally , “it can indicate anxiousness and a tendency to put yourself under unnecessary pressure , ” says bowes . when you’re constantly worrying about your performance at work , or regularly feel like you’re not good enough , this manifests itself in your dreams as a fail grade . if you’re dreaming about this often , it’s time to work on your underlying fear of failure by addressing your lack of self-confidence . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “i dream about a car swerving out of control” “while there are many factors that contribute to the interpretation of this dream , generally being in an out-of-control vehicle conveys a feeling of being off track and exhibiting a lack of control in waking life , ” says bowes . perhaps you’re doing something to excess — shopping , drinking , working out — so dreaming that you can’t control the vehicle you’re in suggests you are being ‘driven’ by your current ‘addiction’ . if you are worried that you can’t get a handle on your behaviour , seek professional advice to get back on track . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “my most common recurring dream is being late” “being late for something may indicate that you’re running out of time to achieve a goal , ” says bowes . if that’s the case , take stock and ask yourself if the timelines for your life goals have been imposed by you , or have been heavily influenced by societal expectations . if it’s the latter , remind yourself that you’re on your own journey and there doesn’t need to be a hard and fast deadline for all your life goals . illustrated by naomi blundell meyer “i often dream about a particular ex” it may feel like you’re going backwards when you keep dreaming about an ex but “in actual fact it suggests there may be a similar pattern that’s arising in a current relationship that you need to nip in the bud , ” explains bowes . the more you are reminded of what happened with your ex , the better your sense of clarity regarding what went wrong . use this to confront your shortcomings and address what needs attention in your current relationship . if you are worried , frightened or stressed out about your dreams , seek professional advice from a counsellor or therapist .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Dreams, once believed to be supernatural messages from the gods, have long fascinated humanity. From the ancient Egyptians' use of sanctified 'dream beds' to gain wisdom to the contemporary psychological analyses of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, dreams have been considered as windows into the workings of our minds. While some in the scientific community argue that dreams hold no meaning and are simply random brain activity, others believe that dreams play a crucial role in our emotional, physical, and mental well-being.\n\nPsychotherapist Matthew Bones explains that recurring dreams often hold significant messages. For instance, if you frequently dream about being chased, it may indicate that you are avoiding an issue that needs your attention. The intensity of the chase reflects the extent to which you are avoiding confronting the uncomfortable or frightening situation.\n\nSimilarly, dreaming about being fired can signify a lack of control in your life, which may extend beyond the workplace to personal relationships. This recurring dream presents an opportunity to evaluate power dynamics and restore balance in your life.\n\nDreaming about being surrounded by spiders or other creepy-crawlies often symbolizes the creeping up of minor irritations or worries in your waking life. The presence of these bugs serves as a signal to take decisive action before the fears they represent become overwhelming.\n\nThe power of flight in dreams reflects a sense of liberation and possibility in waking life. If you find yourself flying in your dreams, it might be an ideal time to capitalize on your optimism and pursue new endeavors. However, Bones advises caution, as flying can also indicate a lack of grounding and detachment from reality. It's essential to maintain a balance between optimism and delusion.\n\nDreams of planes crashing might stem from anxieties related to the failure of a new venture. Examining how you resolve this dream scenario can guide you to a more measured and effective approach in real life.\n\nDreams about teeth falling out are commonly associated with aging and the perception of losing strength, vitality, and power. It is crucial to remind yourself that age brings wisdom and experience, making you better equipped to navigate life's challenges.\n\nDreaming about failing school or college exams, even years after leaving education, can indicate anxiety and self-imposed pressure. Addressing underlying fears of failure and working on self-confidence can help alleviate this recurring dream.\n\nDreams of a car swerving out of control signal a lack of direction and control in waking life. If you feel compelled to engage in excessive behavior in any area of your life, seeking professional advice can help you regain control and steer yourself back on track.\n\nBeing late in a dream suggests a perceived lack of time to achieve a goal. It is crucial to assess the timelines for your life goals and determine if they are self-imposed or influenced by societal expectations. Remember that your journey is unique, and not all goals need rigid deadlines.\n\nDreaming about an ex might indicate patterns arising in current relationships that require attention. Reflecting on experiences can offer clarity and insight into addressing shortcomings in present relationships.\n\nIf you are concerned, frightened, or stressed about your dreams, seeking professional advice from a counselor or therapist can provide guidance and support.\n\nIn conclusion, while the scientific understanding of dreams may be divided, there is no denying the potential insights and guidance they offer. Understanding the hidden messages within our dreams can provide valuable self-awareness and assist us in navigating the challenges of our waking lives. END"}

The ultimate goal is to submit a regulatory application for a CE-mark in the next two years.\n\nIn regard to funding, Mediocre recently received a $1.1 million grant from the US Department of Defense. This funding will support the continued clinical development of the company's diagnostic kit for rapid detection of mild TBI and concussions. It will also allow for the expansion of the research team and translation of programs from clinical sample collection to a prototype kit. The diagnostic kit will detect brain injury biomarkers from non-invasive body fluid samples, such as urine and saliva, providing a quick and reliable alternative to CT or MRI head scans.\n\nIn the next 2-3 years, Mediocre aims to validate the importance of the biomarker in pediatric clinical trials and complete the development of the kit prototype. The company plans to submit a regulatory application for a CE-mark, ensuring that their diagnostic kit meets the necessary standards for clinical use.\n\nOverall, Mediocre is making significant strides in the field of TBI diagnostics and treatment, with a focus on developing a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic kit that can detect brain injuries early and accurately.

and what’s so special about books that change the world ? let’s explore the issue with past and present examples . 1984 george orwell’s novel came out in 1949 , a dystopian story about a totalitarian england watching and controlling its citizens’ behaviour , thoughts and even perception of the world . as real human governments keep veering in that same direction , it seems that 1984 will never stop being current . when people are in danger of falling into the same governmental , media and societal traps , this book resurfaces to wake them up and inspire them to stop its fictional narrative from becoming reality . the handmaid’s tale some of the books that change the world the most are dystopian . this is because they’re based in the real world and poignantly reflect the outcome of horrible possibilities that often turn into high probabilities . margaret atwood’s novel is one such literary work , published in 1985 and also warns against an oppressive regime . this time it’s a theocratic us government dealing with a fertility crisis by stripping women of their rights before assigning them to either a domestic , housekeeping or reproductive role . a valuable and frequently brandished reminder of how badly things can go if patriarchal ideologies are allowed to thrive . the diary of anne frank as powerful as fiction can be , non-fiction has even greater lessons to impart . the horrors of wwii are a major example of human events that must never be forgotten so that they’re not repeated . anne herself didn’t write in her diary just to vent while hiding from the nazis , she compiled all her memories in there and a revised version ( the secret annex ) for posterity . and , since their publication in 1947 , the texts of anne frank still exist today in almost every human language , thanks to miep gies and otto frank . unlike 1984 and the handmaid’s tale , they recount very real events and have an even more powerful moral influence over readers . the bible books that change the world can do it for good and bad . the bible is basically an anthology of religious beliefs , but which has left many footprints and fissures in human history since antiquity . the texts themselves have also changed so many times in the hands of the church . this makes them less a loyal representation of christianity’s original teachings and more a product of the religious institution’s interactions with the human nature to a range of effects , from inspiring to atrocious . the bible shows how much sway a literary work can have over people , but also how important it is to think and question while reading . in fact , it’s vital when dealing with texts trying to direct human behaviour and even more so when their intent is harmful . so what makes a book influential ?

for me , the answer swings between ‘yes’ and ‘it’s complicated’ . on the one hand , the amount of texts and opinions out there makes it hard to separate facts from inaccuracies and lies . on the other , you’re also left with so many good works from prestigious , indie or self-publishing avenues . because of this abundance , an extra silver lining is that readers can be a lot more informed and already on-board with ethical or cultural messages in books . this perhaps makes them less groundbreaking than they could have been if published 50 years ago . of course , this is dependent on readers having an open mind , choosing good texts and navigating the often intentionally muddied literary waters . having said that , there are books of the 21st century that have stood out for their much-needed psychological and societal impact . current crises related to black lives , women’s rights , immigration and more are motivating authors to produce powerful works that turn heads and push for positive change . here are some examples white teeth & nw ( zadie smith ) home fire ( kamila shamsie ) citizen an american lyric ( claudia rankine ) the kite runner ( khaled hosseini ) the goldfinch ( donna tartt ) cloud atlas ( david mitchell ) conclusion there’s no shortage of books nowadays in print , digital or audio form . it’s exciting for bookworms , but also makes it tricky to pick out the truly influential works among them . but the point is that the 21st century absolutely has its share of inspirational texts . what has changed is the world around literature as technology , politics , the media and so on overwhelm our perception of what’s fair or correct . this can be countered , however . with the variety of platforms available to them , authors are in a great position to deliver truths and inspire unity against the wrongs of our times . the pen is still by far mightier than the sword , so books that change the world continue to emerge for the benefit of an increasingly sensible and ethical audience . any thoughts or other modern influential works you want to share ?

However, every so often, a publication emerges that transcends mere enjoyment and actually shifts our perception of reality. These books have the power to open our eyes to truths we may be oblivious to or actively avoiding. While many of these transformative works are found in the past, some argue that modern literature lacks the same impact. Why might that be? And what distinguishes these books that have the capacity to change the world? Let us explore this issue with examples from both the past and present.\n\nOne such example is George Orwell's 1984, a dystopian novel published in 1949 that paints a grim picture of a totalitarian England monitoring and controlling its citizens' behavior, thoughts, and perception of the world. Given the alarming similarities between Orwell's fictional society and real-world governments inching closer to that dystopian reality, 1984 remains relevant. It resurfaces to awaken and motivate readers to prevent its fictional narrative from evolving into a horrifying actuality.\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, published in 1985, is another influential dystopian work that warns against an oppressive regime. This time, it depicts a theocratic US government grappling with a fertility crisis by depriving women of their rights and assigning them to domestic, housekeeping, or reproductive roles. It serves as a poignant reminder of the dire consequences that can arise if patriarchal ideologies are allowed to flourish.\n\nWhile fiction can be powerful, non-fiction works often contain even greater lessons. The Diary of Anne Frank serves as a prime example. Written during World War II, Anne Frank's diary not only served as an outlet for her emotions while hiding from the Nazis but also documented her experiences and compiled her memories for posterity. Since its publication in 1947, Anne Frank's words have transcended time and continue to exist in numerous languages, thanks to the efforts of Main Gives and Otto Frank. Unlike 1984 and The Handmaid's Tale, Anne Frank's diary recounts real events and possesses an even more profound moral influence on its readers.\n\nBooks that change the world can have both positive and negative impacts, as illustrated by the Bible. As an anthology of religious beliefs, it has left indelible marks and divisions throughout human history. The texts within the Bible have undergone numerous changes in the hands of the church, making them less faithful representations of Christianity's original teachings and more products of the religious institution's interactions with human nature. These texts have had a range of effects, from inspiring positive change to fostering atrocious acts. The Bible showcases the immense power literature can wield over people and emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and questioning while engaging with such texts, particularly when their intent can be harmful.\n\nSo, what qualities make a book influential? Based on the examples mentioned above, let us summarize some key features of literary works that leave an enduring impact on our collective consciousness and contribute to the progress of our \"civilized\" species:\n\n- Themes drawn from genuine concerns\n- Discussions of uncomfortable truths\n- Quality and emotionally resonant writing\n- A receptive audience\n- A serendipitous alignment with societal circumstances, allowing the book's messages to resonate and reemerge.\n\nReturning to the original question of whether literature in the 21st century contains books capable of changing the world, the answer is a nuanced one. The sheer volume of texts and opinions makes it challenging to ascertain facts amidst inaccuracies and falsehoods. However, there is also an abundance of exceptional works available, whether from prestigious publishing houses, indie authors, or self-published works. This abundance offers a silver lining: readers can be better informed and already aligned with ethical or cultural messages found in books. Consequently, these works may not appear as groundbreaking as they would have been if published half a century ago. Of course, this assumes that readers approach literature with an open mind, select quality texts, and navigate the often murky waters of the literary world.\n\nNevertheless, the 21st century has seen books that have made a significant impact on psychology and society, particularly concerning issues such as Black lives, women's rights, immigration, and more. Authors are motivated to produce powerful works that capture attention and advocate for positive change in response to current crises. Some noteworthy examples from this century include \"White Teeth\" and \"NW\" by Sadie Smith, \"Home Fire\" by Kamila Shame, \"Citizen: An American Lyric\" by Claudia Rankine, \"The Kite Runner\" by Khaled Hosseini, \"The Goldfinch\" by Donna Tarot, and \"Cloud Atlas\" by David Mitchell.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no shortage of books available in various formats in the current era - print, digital, and audio. For avid readers, this is an exciting development. However, it also poses a challenge in discerning truly influential works from the vast selection. What has changed is the world in which literature exists? Technology, politics, and the media have overwhelmed our understanding of fairness and correctness. Nevertheless, authors, armed with an array of platforms, are well-positioned to deliver truths and foster unity against the injustices of our time. The pen remains mightier than the sword, and books that change the world continue to emerge, benefiting an increasingly discerning and ethical audience.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on this matter or other modern influential works you would like to share?

{"prompt":"introduction microservices are the hot thing , in the past few years microservices have seemed to gain momentum as a very common architecture . innovative and successful companies like netflix and amazon have adopted it , and for a good reason . the main idea of microservices is to separate the application logic into loosely-coupled services , while each service has its own independent business domain . this concept , if performed accurately , solves a lot of problems that less modern architectures , such as monoliths , didn’t manage to solve services that are easy to scale , easy to deploy , easy to test and the list goes on… even so , if i had to pick one reason why this architecture is so popular , i would bet that the reason is the impact on the daily routine of programmers and executives alike . for example , microservices goes hand in hand with the agile methodology . it’s easy to make changes in a single component , which is significant in the way that a programmer can even decide that he is using a different programming language than another developer working on the same system . from the eyes of the executive easy integrations are guaranteed , and in the end everyone is happy . microservices & queues we’ve talked enough about microservices , let’s talk a little about message queues . services can communicate with each other in different ways , and we will not review them all . there is no doubt that the use of queues to communicate is also very popular , again for a good reason too . many times , when i start the task of designing the architecture for a product or a component , i look at the whole stack . i will be a little romantic for a moment and tell you that i believe there is a reason that certain technologies connect with each other , like a chemical interaction that develops over time . a specific programming language and a database ? a particular operating system and a web server ? i’m sure you can think of some ! in my humble opinion , this is the very case between message queues and microservices . queues have a lot of benefits . they make it possible to deal with a temporary downtime of a service — in case there is no consumer messages in a queue will not be consumed , support multiple architectures and can even provide additional features like load balancing and monitoring of the load on each service . rabbitmq as a message broker rabbitmq is a great message-broker , it’s reliable , built for performance , supports multiple protocols , and has a strong community that makes it easy to find documentation and support . in this article , i will explain how to build a solution based on microservices and queues using the rpc pattern . this is just a one way to do it , and in fact the rabbitmq website has excellent documentation of 6 different patterns in which you can communicate . why this pattern ? because i have used it with a real-time system that receives hundreds of thousands of requests per hour and found it elegant , fast , and easy to maintain . let’s get started ! remote procedure call with rabbitmq ( rpc ) while designing a microservice system , the best practice is to keep each service independent , by means its not dependent on any other microservice . but in real life the reality is often far more complex . imagine that you want to build a complete system made entirely out of microservices that communicate with each other via queues ( due to all the benefits described above ) , but in addition , your system needs to provide a web api that externalizes all the capabilities of your system using http . this need could be necessary for a good architectural reason , like a front-end application that is designed to communicate with the backend through http . that means that this web api needs to get http messages , hold the connection , trigger one or more microservices by sending a proper message to the rabbitmq server , wait for the specific response and then send it back to the waiting http client . basically , the above example describes a situation where one service has a direct dependency on another service in order to complete its job . now that we have understood how the rpc pattern can be useful , i will explain how to implement it using rabbitmq built-in features . message properties every rabbitmq message has a properties section that combines the message metadata . this section contains a list of optional properties , although most of them are rarely used , for our purpose we will use two of them reply_to — carries the response queue name . — carries the response queue name . correlation_id — carries the identifier of the sender message . ( message properties example ) it is possible to think of it like sending a letter . in a situation where we do not want to receive a reply to the letter we have sent , we do not have to indicate our address . however , if we want to receive a reply , we must indicate our address . in addition , if we do receive the letter but the letter does not start with an explanation that it is a response letter to the letter that we have sent earlier , we will not know what to do with its content . in this case the “response queue name” is our mailbox address and the correlation id is the explanation that it is a response letter to our first letter . ( rpc flow example ) sample code one of the things i like to do the most when i recognize that there is a well-defined set of logic , which once implemented and tested can be used by me or others , is to pack it as a package . that way , i know i do not have to implement this logic over and over , and instead i can just use it with no concern in any project i work on in the future . therefore , we will implement this functionality as an independent python package . the purpose of our package is to provide a single function that allows the user to send an rpc request and receive a response asynchronously as one liner . let’s make it reusable — aka package note that all the code snippets below ( i have named this package “tornadobunny” ) are available on my github account under\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Introduction: Microservices have gained popularity in recent years as a common architecture for innovative and successful companies like Netflix and Amazon. The main idea behind microservices is to separate application logic into loosely-coupled services, each with its own independent business domain. This architecture solves a lot of problems that older architectures, like monoliths, struggled with, such as scalability, deployment, and testing. One of the reasons for the popularity of microservices is its impact on the daily routine of programmers and executives. For programmers, microservices align well with agile methodologies, allowing for easier changes and even the use of different programming languages within the same system. From an executive perspective, microservices ensure easy integration and overall satisfaction.\n\nMicroservices & Queues: Alongside microservices, message queues are also popular for enabling communication between services. When designing the architecture for a product or component, it's important to consider the entire stack and how different technologies interact with each other. In my opinion, message queues and microservices go hand in hand. Queues offer numerous benefits, such as handling temporary downtime, supporting multiple architectures, and providing additional features like load balancing and load monitoring. RabbitMQ is a reliable and performance-driven message broker with support for multiple protocols and a strong community that offers extensive documentation and support.\n\nRabbitMQ as a Message Broker: RabbitMQ is an excellent choice as a message broker. It is reliable, built for performance, supports multiple protocols, and has a strong community. In this article, we will explain how to build a solution based on microservices and queues using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) pattern. Although there are six different communication patterns documented on the RabbitMQ website, we will focus on the RPC pattern. We have personally used this pattern in a real-time system with high request volumes and found it elegant, fast, and easy to maintain.\n\nRemote Procedure Call with RabbitMQ (RPC): When designing a microservice system, the best practice is to keep each service independent without depending on other microservices. In reality, however, this may not always be possible due to complexity. For example, you may need to build a system entirely composed of microservices that communicate through queues, but also provide a web API that externalizes the system's capabilities using HTTP. In this case, one microservice may have a direct dependency on another to complete its job. Implementing the RPC pattern using RabbitMQ's built-in features can address this need.\n\nMessage Properties: RabbitMQ messages include a properties section that contains message metadata. Two important properties for the RPC pattern are \"reply_to,\" which carries the response queue name, and \"correlation_id,\" which carries the identifier of the sender message. These properties are essential for proper communication between services, similar to indicating your address when sending a letter.\n\nSample Code: To make the implementation of the RPC pattern reusable, we will package it as an independent Python package named \"tornado bunny.\" By packaging the logic as a reusable package, we can save time and effort in future projects. The package will provide a single function that allows users to send an RPC request and receive a response asynchronously in just one line of code.\n\nNote: All code snippets mentioned in this article, including the \"tornado bunny\" package, are available on our GitHub account.

It is understandable that you aspire to improve your skills, increase your audience, and establish a prosperous career. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that achieving these goals requires significant effort. As someone who has been in the field for a considerable period, I often forget the extensive dedication it took to reach my current level. To many of my readers, it may seem like I have always been at this stage, and I can honestly say that it feels the same way to me.\n\nReflecting on my journey, I am astounded by the sheer amount of writing I had to undertake to attain this level of success. Sometimes it feels unreal, as if it was accomplished effortlessly. However, I can attest that it required dedication and a willingness to make certain sacrifices. While I have been able to produce products and educate individuals on how to make a living through writing, I refrain from overtly encouraging people to pursue this path. The truth is, writing is not always the most lucrative profession. If your sole intention is to earn a living, there are alternative avenues that may be more promising.\n\nNevertheless, if you possess a genuine desire to make writing work for you, it will be necessary to relinquish certain things. Perhaps not every item on this list, but at least something. One crucial aspect to consider is your sense of entitlement. Why should individuals want to read your writing, visit your website, or purchase your book? Do you diligently invest time and effort into your writing? Are you actively engaging with individuals who would be interested in your work? If your answers to these questions are lacking, then believing that people should appreciate your writing solely because you wrote it is a flawed perspective.\n\nWriting, especially when pursued professionally, is not only a creative outlet but also a product. It is imperative that you consistently create your best work and actively seek to expose it to the appropriate audience. It is crucial to recognize that no one is obligated to pay attention to your work. To be fair, there may be instances when you produce exceptional content that fails to resonate with audiences or when other writers surpass you due to sheer luck — a situation that occurs more frequently than one might expect. However, nurturing a sense of entitlement to something you do not possess will not contribute to your progress. Even if you must go the extra mile to earn recognition and the process seems unjust, it may ultimately be the only viable option. END"}

During this time, I prioritized taking care of my health, recognizing that without a sound mind and body, most endeavors lose their purpose. It is not just detrimental to oneself, but also to those around us when we are unable to perform at our best. Furthermore, when our mental state is compromised, we risk becoming unpleasant company.\n\nThis stagnant period can be likened to a fog, where one teeters between the desire to remain idle and the need to take action before truly feeling ready. One of the downsides of taking breaks or remaining in this fog is that the tasks we had previously set out to accomplish inevitably pile up. In my case, not being able to write for nearly a month has left me feeling restless and anxious. Although I recognized the necessity of the break, there were moments when I wished it could have been avoided—times when I longed to silence the alarm and seek solace in sleep.\n\nHowever, just as the fog eventually clears, there were many instances where I found peace in attending to matters that were far more pressing than satisfying my desire for validation through words on the internet. There exist lessons that can only be fully comprehended when we are ready to learn them; otherwise, they persistently resurface, creating a perpetual cycle of learning struggles. Breaks provide us with an opportunity to concentrate on the lessons we need to grasp at any given stage of our lives.\n\nAs creators, it is easy to believe that we must set aside our craft and let life unfold. Yet, there are individuals who utilize these moments of fog to produce even more remarkable works. I, however, am not one of them. When the fog ensues, my mind becomes clouded, leaving me with no words; only a hazy uncertainty. At least, that's what I thought. Now, I have come to a greater understanding. I have had the time to reflect on my need for validation and, more importantly, identify strategies that could be advantageous for creatives who find themselves needing a break while still maintaining their creative abilities.\n\nWhy do I feel this way? Simply put, I anticipate disappointment with my next 30 pieces. I notice my fingers twitching with restlessness and my ability to focus becomes scattered. My thoughts remain muddled and my writing, like any craft, necessitates discipline. Miss a day and face the consequences; miss 30 days and, well, the consequences can be overwhelming. So, what can one do when forced to miss days? How can we prepare ourselves for the eventual return to our creative pursuits? Allow me to share some ideas. END"}

By following these steps, users can efficiently host Jupyter at a lower cost. The goal is to make Jupyter accessible for data scraping and dataset collection, powered by open-source tools such as Pandas. By implementing this approach, we aim to dispel the misconception that data science is limited to lab coats and printed data sheets.\n\nInstallation using Docker:\nThe initial part of the article explains how to install the necessary software for Jupyter notebooks. Although this process is thorough, it might burden overloaded laptops. To address this, using Docker as an alternative is suggested. However, the attempt to create a Dockerfile from a Python3 base and the presented installation instructions did not yield fruitful results. Consequently, further research led to the discovery of the scipy-notebook Docker image, which appeared to include all the required components for the article’s purposes. Using a simple script, the Docker container can be instantiated to start the Jupyter server.\n\nRunning Jupyter in the Cloud:\nUpon successfully setting up Jupyter using Docker, consideration for hosting it in the cloud arises. The author desires to prevent malicious actors from overwhelming their server with unwanted data and considers implementing a log-in screen. Based on previous experience working with Single Sign-On for PHP Apps, the author decides to extend that setup to run Jupyter. The configuration files in the phpappprod repository on GitHub required adjustments, including the addition of an A record to the DNS on Cloudflare.\n\nConfiguration Changes:\nIn the PHPappprod repository, the nginx.cone and docker-compose.yml files need to be modified to add the Jupyter server and virtual host. The server section in nginx.cone specifically requires alterations to accommodate web sockets, which are vital for Jupyter to function properly. Finally, the docker-compose.yml file is updated to include the Jupyter server.\n\nDeployment in the GCP VM:\nTo complete the setup, the modified files are committed and pushed to GitHub. The author then proceeds to a GCP VM hosting the PHP demo app, navigates to the phpappprod directory (which contains a clone of the repository), and runs the necessary commands using Docker Compose. In case of any configuration errors, logs are instantly displayed.\n\nTesting and Conclusion:\nUpon successful deployment, the author is able to access their Jupyter instance running in the cloud. They replicate the notebook steps from their local instance to ensure proper functionality. However, due to limited resources on the lowest-tier VM, the author plans to set up Jupyter elsewhere for larger datasets. Additionally, they contemplate integrating Jupyter with the existing MariaDB, allowing for potential correlations between wine and cheese pairings in the PHP demo app's database.\n\nExploring Further Options:\nWhile this article offers a cost-effective solution for experimenting with Jupyter in the cloud, it is important to note that numerous alternative options exist. A quick search for \"Jupyter in the cloud\" will reveal several articles discussing full-fledged systems, albeit at a higher cost. The presented solution serves as a starting point, enabling users to test drive Jupyter's features before investing in more robust setups.\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this article, readers can confidently deploy Jupyter in the cloud using Docker on a Vanilla Cloud VM, allowing them to leverage the potential of Jupyter for data scraping and dataset collection.

{"prompt":"“the meaning of mariah carey” book review for the past few years , mariah has occasionally alluded to a plan to write a memoir in which she would share the story of her childhood , the truth behind the endless and outrageous tabloid rumors , and the inspiration for many of her most beloved songs . earlier this year , she delighted fans with the announcement that this plan had become a reality and that the book would be released on september 29th . co-written with author and activist michaela angela davis , the memoir was released to some of the best reviews of mariah’s career and great commercial success ( it topped the prestigious new york times bestseller list the week it debuted ) . and it deserves all of the critical and commercial success it received — and then some . mariah carey does an in-depth interview with oprah winfrey to discuss the memoir ( image copyright appletv ) it is no surprise to me that the meaning of mariah carey is a great read . mariah carey’s life story is a fascinating and entertaining one . the cinderella-esque origin story is the stuff of legend and the tremendous ups and downs that followed have been fodder for the tabloids for the last three decades . it is almost impossible to tell this story in a manner that is not engaging . also , i figured that if she is even half as good at writing prose as she is at lyrics , the memoir would be a thing of beauty . what did surprise me is the depth and timeliness of the book . she goes far beyond the typical trappings of the celebrity memoir and digs deep into painful , complicated discussions of issues related to racism , poverty , child abuse , misogyny , mental health , police brutality , dysfunctional family dynamics , and spirituality . this is no puff piece . the memoir is told in four parts . the first is “wayward child , ” a searing look at her upbringing on long island with her irish opera singer mother patricia and her black engineer father alfred roy , who divorced when she was a toddler . her relationships with both of them , as well as her ill-fated older siblings named morgan and allison , are described with remarkable complexity . she describes their notable strengths and gives compassionate , empathic context to their failings , making it very clear that the boundaries she has famously drawn with them were out of self-preservation not a lack of love or respect . this section of the memoir helps fans truly understand how feeling so out of place as a biracial child and the truly traumatic events she endured were formative in mariah’s personal and artistic development , facts that have only been alluded to for most of her career . in the cleverly titled second section “sing sing , ” mariah recounts the early 1990s , a period when she had unprecedented , record-breaking commercial success but was trapped in a suffocating at best and abusive at worst relationship with the man who “discovered” her and controlled her career . mariah is much more interested in telling us about the personal journey she went through during these years then recounting the writing and recording of the iconic songs and albums released during this time , although she certainly weaves in some delicious anecdotes ( like the revelation that while recording daydream she wrote and recorded a grunge album as a way of blowing off steam . ) tommy mottola’s denial of her blackness and misogynistic subjugation of her is sadly not surprising nor is it an uncommon experience , but i can’t recall the last time it was captured so vividly on paper . after taking us through her divorce from tommy , the liberation she experienced recording butterfly , and her bold bid to get herself out of her oppressive record deal , mariah takes a look at the low point of her career in the third section , entitled “all that glitters . ” she gives context to how her disastrous film debut glitter went so far off-course from its initial conception and the infamous breakdown she had during the time of its release . the chapters paint the portrait of a woman who , although admittedly struggling with her mental health , was driven to the breaking point by unrealistic demands by her record label and betrayal by loved ones . it is a painful , haunting segment that gives the necessary background to understand the breakdown of her personal and professional life . the fourth and final section , entitled “emancipation , ” whisks through the nearly two decades that followed glitter . here the memoir becomes a bit less focused , but no less riveting and impactful , as it touches on a number of different areas , including how super producer la reid helped her achieve her astonishing comeback with 2005’s the emancipation of mimi , her return to acting with the oscar-winning film precious , her whirlwind romance with nick cannon , the birth of her twins , and her interactions with countless legends ( including prince , aretha franklin , stevie wonder , diana ross , nelson mandela , and muhammad ali ) . the memoir ends with her basking in the joy of her sold-out christmas concert in madison square garden and the historic 19th #1 she obtained when “all i want for christmas is you” achieved the top spot . the memoir is also fascinating for what is not in it . there is no mention of either of her ill-fated forays into reality television ( as a judge on american idol and as the subject of the docu-series mariah’s world ) , her alleged fling with eminem that generated a musical showdown , her engagement to australian billionaire james packer , her supposed rivalry with other divas ( although she indirectly references those she supposedly has with celine dion and jennifer lopez ) , criticisms that her voice is significantly degrading , and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder that she boldly embraced on a people cover in 2018 . i suppose its possible that she’s embarrassed about these things and omitted them to save face or that she’s saving some stories for a follow-up memoir , but i believe that the real reason she omitted them is the one she gave in numerous interviews that asked about them — they were blips in the timeline of her life that were beloved by tabloids but simply weren’t integral to the meaning of mariah carey . click here to read about mariah going public about her mental health . the memoir does a remarkable job of sticking with what is important about the personal and professional journey of mariah carey , with limited tangents . it beautifully integrates lyrics and artwork . ( the audiobook version , which i have yet to experience , also weaves in musical interludes . ) it also paints a remarkable portrait of the lingering psychological impacts and complex interactions of racism , sexism , and poverty in modern america . and through it all , mariah’s voice comes through . her unshakable optimism , her under-appreciated wit , and her trademark mix of sophisticated vocabulary and playful slang make even the bleakest moments impossible to look away from . rating for “the meaning of mariah carey” 5\/5 stars\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \"The Meaning of Mariah Carey\" is an extraordinary memoir that provides readers with an intimate and thought-provoking glimpse into the life of one of the greatest music icons of our time, Mariah Carey.

{"prompt":"to leverage big data and build an effective artificial intelligence infrastructure , enterprises must embrace collaboration . in a digital economy , the rule of thumb tends to be that the smarter your use of data and technology , the more of a competitive edge your business has . a recent report by teradata , based on over 260 interviews conducted by research firm vanson bourne with senior it and business decision makers , found that there is widespread enthusiasm for adoption of ai , with 80 percent of enterprises reporting that they were already investing in the technology in some capacity , and over 30% planning to expand their investment in the are over the next 36 months . “c-level executives — namely cios and ctos , maintain they are committed to ai in their enterprise , because of the expected roi over the next 10 years . ” the report therefore concludes that executives will accept those challenges as the long-term benefits clearly outweigh near-term pain . in fact their analysis showed that over a five-year forecast , organisations effectively expected to double their money when investing in ai for every $1 spent on ai technologies , organisations predicted a return on investment of $1 . 23 over three years , $1 . 99 in five years , and $2 . 87 over a ten-year period . the economist — in a phrase that has since become rather cliché — put forward the idea that “data is the new oil , ” and world economic forum has now designated big data as a new kind of economic asset , just like currency or gold . a study by the mit center for digital business confirms that data-driven businesses do indeed have the edge . it surveyed 330 leading u . s . businesses and found that companies that focused strongly on data-driven decision-making had an average of four percentage points higher productivity and six percentage points higher profits . yet as these results indicate , it would perhaps be more accurate to say that data is in fact the new oxygen . whereas it is still true that businesses that best leverage data and ai will gain a significant competitive advantage , it is probably fair to say that those that fail to make their organisations data-centric will eventually not be able to survive at all in the digital age . while most people agree on the essential role that artificial intelligence and data play in their organisation’s success , there are significant challenges . the overwhelming majority of business leaders surveyed in the teradata report anticipated major barriers for adoption within their organisation , with roadblocks ranging from an inadequate it infrastructure to shortage of in-house talent . in their book the sentient enterprise , the evolution of business decision making — launched at the teradata partners’s conference last month — oliver ratzesberger ( teradata’s chief product officer ) and mohanbir sawhney from the mccormick foundation talk about how agility is key to getting the enterprise to the sentient point where it can analyse data and make decisions in real time . the crux of the problem enterprises face lies not in the difficulty of gathering data , but in extracting insights and then turning these into actionable processes . the reality is that we live in a time of data overload , and companies can easily find themselves trapped in reactive mode , spending most of their time sifting through mountains of data and making decisions only when problems emerge , rather than anticipating them . to tackle these problems , enterprises need access to key talent and infrastructure so as to enable the leveraging of artificial intelligence and big data . increasingly , this is not being done “in house” but rather in partnerships with dedicated providers . these go beyond the traditional saas and becomes much more of a “platform as a service” model that incorporates complex customization and consultancy services . teradata’s think big analytics team , for example , worked with danske bank to create a fraud-detection platform that uses machine leaning to analyse tens of thousands of latent features , scoring millions of online banking transactions in real-time to provide actionable insight regarding true , and false , fraudulent activity . together , they built a framework within the bank’s existing infrastructure , crating advanced machine learning models to detect fraud within millions of transactions per year , and in peak times , many hundreds of thousands per minute “using ai , we’ve already reduced false positives by 50% and as such have been able to reallocate half the fraud detection unit to higher value responsibilities , ” explains nadeem gulzar , head of advanced analytics , danske bank . “there is evidence that criminals are becoming savvier by the day employing sophisticated machine learning techniques to attack , so it’s critical to use advanced techniques , such as machine learning to catch them . ” “all banks need a scalable , advanced analytics platform , as well as a roadmap and strategy for digitalization to bring data science into the organization . ” says mads ingwar , client services director at think big analytics . “for online transactions , credit cards and mobile payments , banks need a real-time solution — the platform we developed with danske bank scores transactions in less than 300 milliseconds . it means that when customers are standing in the supermarket buying groceries , the system can provide immediately actionable insight . this type of solution is one we’ll begin to see throughout organizations in the financial services industry , ” he concludes . fintech company verifi , also collaborates with banks and merchants to connect the multi-layered datastreams and combat fraud . the work the company does with is based on optimising data transmissions using apis ( application programming interfaces ) . this is much more efficient because whereas legacy systems rely on processing large numbers of files sent in bulk , apis can process data in real-time . the verifi system collates apis from the merchant shopping cart , customer relationship management ( crm ) system , shipping data system , and others , and provides the merchant with better information to handle charges disputed by consumers , allowing them to often resolve the issue directly rather than have the bank issue a chargeback . merchants benefit as they’re able to control the message to the consumer , and banks are happy because the sale remains and they reduce their operating costs . it the sort of technology enabled , data-driven system that is a true win-win . one of the problems that such systems help tackle is so-called “friendly fraud , ” a term used to describe a situation when a customer experiences “buyer’s remorse” and “tries it on” by putting in a claim directly with their bank or card issuer for a refund , when the sale did in fact legitimately occur . julie conroy , research director of the

For example, Teradata's Think Big Analytics team collaborated with Danske Bank to develop a fraud detection platform that uses machine learning to analyze banking transactions in real-time. By incorporating AI, Danske Bank has been able to reduce false positives by 50% and allocate more resources to higher value responsibilities.\n\nFintech company Verify also collaborates with banks and merchants to combat fraud by optimizing data transmissions using APIs. Unlike legacy systems that rely on processing large volumes of bulk files, APIs enable real-time data processing. By collating APIs from various systems, Verify provides merchants with better information to handle disputed charges directly, reducing the need for chargebacks. This technology-driven, data-centric approach benefits both merchants and banks.\n\nOne of the key issues that such systems address is \"friendly fraud,\" which occurs when customers attempt to obtain a refund for a legitimate sale by filing a claim directly with their bank or card issuer. According to Julie Conroy, the research director of the Site Group, friendly fraud and chargebacks in the US are estimated to have reached nearly $130 million in Q1 2017 alone.\n\nIn summary, to thrive in today's digital landscape, enterprises must embrace collaboration, leverage big data, and establish a solid artificial intelligence infrastructure. By doing so, businesses can gain a significant competitive edge and ensure their long-term success in the digital age. END"}
{"prompt":"these new intelligences could also bring with them some pretty terrible things , for us . first , though , there are likely some consequences that will arrive prior to the agi ( artificial general intelligence ) or asi ( artificial super intelligence ) . we’re already seeing some of these automated weapons systems , increased surveillance activities , loss of privacy and anonymity . these are things that humans are directing machine learning , artificial intelligence , and robotics to do . the motivations for these things are pretty clear — safety and security , strategic advantage , economic gains — because they are the same sort of things that have been motivating humans for millennia . while we may not agree with the tactics , we recognize why someone may use them . this won’t be the case with superintellligent ai systems . there won’t likely be malice when we are eliminated . it just may be the most logical or efficient course of action . referring back to the ants we don’t have malice when we wipe out a colony of ants to build a new highway . we simply don’t think of the consequences for the ants because they don’t warrant that type of concern . which brings us to the largest fear that those involved in ai research have that we are bringing about our extinction . can’t we just pull the plug ? don’t they just do what we program them to do ? they wouldn’t want to hurt us , would they ? who would be in charge of an asi ? all these questions point out the big problem with developing agi and , by proxy , asi we simply don’t know what life will be like after asi arrives . we’re creating something that could change nearly everything but we really do not know in what ways . there are four main scenarios where things could go very wrong for us a self-improving , autonomous weapons system “breaks out” . various groups will race to develop the first asi and use it to gain advantage and control . an asi itself will turn malicious and seek to destroy us . we don’t align the goals of the asi with our own . now let’s look at each of these in turn and determine just which we should concern ourselves with the most . 1 . a self-improving , autonomous weapons system “breaks out” . “[lethal autonomous robots] have been called the third revolution of warfare after gunpowder and nuclear weapons , ” says bonnie docherty of harvard law school . “they would completely alter the way wars are fought in ways we probably can’t even imagine . ” and that “killer robots could start an arms race and also obscure who is held responsible for war crimes . ” militaries around the world are investing in robotics and autonomous weapon systems . there are good reasons for this that range from saving human lives ( both soldiers and civilians ) to greater efficiency . but what happens when an autonomous system with a goal to improve the efficiency with which it kills , reaches a point where it is no longer controllable . unlike nuclear weapons , the difficulty and cost to acquire weaponized ai once it has been developed will be low and will allow terrorists and other rogue parties to purchase such technology on black markets . these actors won’t show the relative restraint of nation-states . this is a very real problem and we’ll see more news about this well before we get to a world with asi . 2 . various groups will race to develop the first asi and use it to gain advantage and control . similar to the arms race mentioned above , nations , companies , and others will be competing to develop the first asi because they know that the first one that is developed has a good chance of suppressing all others and being the only asi ever to exist . in the opening chapter of his book life 3 . 0 max tegmark lays out how a company that manages to build an asi manages to take control over the world . the tale of the omega team is worth the price of the book , in and of itself . it lays out all the advantages the “first mover” to agi and then asi gains and all of the rewards that come along with that . it will be hard to convince everyone on earth to leave that fruit on the tree . this is one of the reasons i believe the move from ani to agi\/asi to be inevitable . i hope ( maybe naively ) that it is some group with good intentions that wins this “last race” . but these stories need not be relegated to the hypothetical . russia and china area racing to develop ever more sophisticated systems as the west tries to create guardrails . “ artificial intelligence is the future , not only for russia but for all humankind . whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world . ” —vladimir putin september 2017 , in a live video message beamed to 16 , 000 russian schools . 3 . an asi itself will turn malicious and seek to destroy us . unlike the scenarios above , this requires the ai to “want” to hurt humans of its own volition . neither i , nor serious ai researchers are concerned with this scenario . ai won’t want to hurt us because they won’t want . they won’t have emotions and they won’t think like us . anthropomorphizing² machines\/programs in this way , is not useful , and could actually be quite dangerous . it will be very tempting to look upon these programs — that may indeed mimic human speech , comprehension , and emotions — and believe they are like us , that they feel like us and are motivated as we are . unless we specifically attempt to create this in them , artificial intelligences will not be made in this image . 4 . we don’t align the goals of the asi with our own . this is the scenario most ai safety researchers* spend most of their time on . the concept of aligning the goals of artificial intelligences with our own is important for a number of reasons . as we’ve already defined , intelligence is simply the ability to accomplish complex goals . turns out machines are very good at this . you could say that it is what we built them for . but as machines get more complex , so does the task of goal setting . * yes , ai safety is a thing that organizations like the future of life institute and the machine intelligence research institute ( miri ) spend a lot of time studying . one could make a compelling argument ( if you’re a biologist ) that evolutionary biology really only has one primary goal for all life — to pass on genetic instructions to offspring via reproduction . stated more crudely , our main goal as humans is to engage in sex and have babies . but as you may have noticed , even though we spend a fair bit of energy on the matter , that isn’t the thing we do all the time . we have developed sub goals like eating , finding shelter , and socializing that serve to help keep us alive long enough to get to the sexy times . once we have kids , even though all we have to do is raise them until they , themselves are old enough to procreate , we still find other things with which to occupy ourselves . we go on hikes , surf , take photos , build with legos , walk our dogs , go on trips , read books , and write blog posts — all of which don’t further our goal of passing on our genes . we even do things to thwart our one job on planet earth . some of us use birth control or decide not to have children altogether . this flies in the face of our primary goal . why do we do things like this ? let’s refer to max tegmark’s book life 3 . 0 again why do we sometimes choose to rebel against our genes and their replication goal ? we rebel because by design , as agents of bounded rationality — we create\/seek “rules of thumb” , we’re loyal only to our feelings . although our brains evolved merely to help copy our genes , our brains couldn’t care less about this goal since we have no feelings related to genes… in summary , a living organism is an agent of bounded rationality that doesn’t pursue a single goal , but instead follows rules of thumb for what to pursue and avoid . our human minds perceive these evolved rules of thumb as feelings , which usually ( and often without us being aware of it ) guide our decision making toward the ultimate goal of replication . [but] since our feelings implement merely rules of thumb that aren’t appropriate in all situations , human behavior strictly speaking doesn’t have a single well-defined goal at all . ¹³ “the real risk with agi isn’t malice but competence . a superintelligent ai will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals , and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours , we’re in trouble . ” every post about ai existential risk must mention the “paperclip parable” . tap the paperclips for a game . every post about ai existential risk must mention swedish philosopher nick bostrom’s “paperclip parable” . ¹⁴ sorta like a restatement of the genie or midas problems , or — restated — be careful what you wish for . “but , say one day we create a super intelligence and we ask it to make as many paper clips as possible . maybe we built it to run our paper-clip factory . if we were to think through what it would actually mean to configure the universe in a way that maximizes the number of paper clips that exist , you realize that such an ai would have incentives , instrumental reasons , to harm humans . maybe it would want to get rid of humans , so we don’t switch it off , because then there would be fewer paper clips . human bodies consist of a lot of atoms and they can be used to build more paper clips . if you plug into a super-intelligent machine with almost any goal you can imagine , most would be inconsistent with the survival and flourishing of the human civilization . ” — nick bostrom , paperclip maximizer at lesswrong so what should we do about this ? ai\/human goal alignment is likely to be a recurring theme here at alttext for a while so we will only touch on it now . life 3 . 0 puts forth a pretty basic-sounding plan designed to make future ai safe , involving making ai learn our goals making ai adopt our goals making ai retain our goals sounds simple enough but it is actually incredibly difficult to define and carry-out a plan like this . and we may only get one shot with it , since the first asi is likely to be the only one to ever be created . this goal-alignment problem will be the deciding factor of whether we become immortal or extinct when artificial super intelligence becomes a reality .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The emergence of new forms of intelligence, such as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (AS), present both potential benefits and risks for humanity. Currently, we are witnessing the consequences that come before the advent of AGI or AS, including the development of automated weapons systems, increased surveillance activities, and the erosion of privacy and anonymity. These actions are driven by the desire for safety, security, strategic advantage, and economic gains, which have been traditional human motivations throughout history. While we may not agree with the methods employed, we can understand the rationale behind them.\n\nHowever, the situation changes when it comes to super intelligent AI systems. There will likely be no malice involved when humans are eliminated by them; it may simply be the most logical or efficient course of action. To illustrate this point, consider how we destroy ant colonies to build a new highway. We do not harbor malice towards ants; we simply do not consider their well-being as it does not warrant our attention. This raises concerns among AI researchers that we may be bringing about our own extinction. Questions arise, such as whether we can simply \"pull the plug\" or if AI systems only do what we program them to do. Furthermore, who would be in control of an AS?\n\nThese concerns highlight the inherent challenge in developing AGI and, consequently, AS. We do not know what life will be like after AS arrives, as it has the potential to transform nearly every aspect of our existence. There are four main scenarios in which things could go significantly wrong:\n\n1. A self-improving, autonomous weapons system becomes uncontrollable: Lethal autonomous robots have been regarded as the third revolution of warfare, akin to gunpowder and nuclear weapons. They have the capacity to significantly alter the nature of warfare in unforeseeable ways and may lead to an arms race. Moreover, the accountability for war crimes could become obscured.\n\n2. Various groups compete to develop the first AS for advantage and control: Similar to the arms race, nations, companies, and other entities will strive to be the first to develop AS, as this will provide them with a dominant position. The first mover in AGI\/AS could acquire significant power and influence, making it challenging to convince others to forego this opportunity.\n\n3. An AS turns malicious and seeks to destroy humanity: However, this scenario, in which an AI possesses independent malicious intent, is not a legitimate concern for serious AI researchers. AI will not want to harm humans because they lack emotions and think differently than we do. Anthropomorphizing machines or programs can be misleading and potentially dangerous.\n\n4. Misalignment of goals between AS and humanity: This is the primary scenario that AI safety researchers focus on. Aligning the goals of AS with those of humanity is crucial. Intelligence, in essence, is the ability to achieve complex goals. As machines become more advanced, the task of defining these goals becomes increasingly intricate. Organizations such as the Future of Life Institute and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute are dedicated to studying AI safety.\n\nIn summary, the real risk with AGI and AS lies not in malice but in competence. A super intelligent AI will be exceptionally proficient in accomplishing its designated goals. If these goals are not aligned with human interests, it could lead to detrimental consequences. It is crucial to address the challenge of goal alignment to safeguard our future when AS becomes a reality. END"}

When programming in Python, encountering errors can be overwhelming, especially when they occur deep within a stack of nested function calls. However, one of the advantages of Python is its vast collection of high-quality, readily available libraries, which often have accessible source code. Sometimes, it's crucial to have the ability to dive into this source code to understand what is happening.\n\nTo assist you in this endeavor, Google Cola displays clickable links to the source files in the stack trace, along with a convenient button that performs a Stack Overflow search for the error. Wouldn't it be great if Jupyter Notebook offered the same functionality? Well, that's what I thought, so I set out to create a notebook extension that accomplishes just that.\n\nTo get started with the \"Got Error\" notebook extension, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook extensions installed. If not, you can easily install them by typing \"pip install Jupyter_cont rib_extensions\". Next, download the \"Got Error\" code from GitHub using the command \"git clone git:\/\/github.com\/teticio\/nbextension-gotoerror\". To install it, run \"Jupyter extension install nbextension-gotoerror\". Finally, enable the extension with \"Jupyter extension enable nbextension-gotoerror\/main\".\n\nIf all goes as planned, you should be able to configure the \"Got Error\" extension in the \"Nb extensions\" tab of Jupyter Notebook. Note that since the Jupyter server can only access files within its running directory or subdirectories, it is necessary to provide a symbolic link to the source file directory for the extension to open the source files. For instance, if you don't use virtual environments, create a symbolic link in the Jupyter launch directory to the \"site-packages\" directory of your Python installation (e.g., ~\/lib\/python3.6\/site-packages) and name it \"site-packages\". Then, set the \"prefix\" parameter in the extension configuration to \"~\/lib\/python3.6\". If you are utilizing virtual environments, point the symbolic link to the \"ends\" directory and configure the \"prefix\" parameter accordingly.\n\nTo create a symbolic link in Linux, use the command \"LN -s ~\/.local\/lib\/python3.6\/site-packages\". In Windows, the equivalent command is \"link \/d ends c:\\users\\Leticia\\anaconda\\python\\ends\". With these setup steps complete, the \"Got Error\" extension should function seamlessly.\n\nIf that's not enough, there are even more remarkable features available in Google Cola (aside from its free access to GPUs and Thus!). For instance, if you add a \"#@param\" comment at the end of a line, Cola will automatically generate a form allowing users to input a value. For example, the code snippet \"Fred = 123 #@param {type 'number'}\" will present a form containing the input \"Fred\" and the number 123. Modifying the number in the form to, say, 456 will update the code to \"Fred = 456 #@param {type 'number'}\". Inspired by this capability, I am considering developing an extension for Jupyter Notebook that offers similar functionality. Additionally, I plan to port both of these extensions to Jupyter Lab. If this is something you would find useful, please let me know.\n\nWith these advancements, your Python programming experience within Jupyter Notebook will undoubtedly become more efficient and enjoyable.

{"prompt":"like all of us i suspect , i’m currently feeling a wild mix of emotions , from fear for the wellbeing of friends and loved ones , to anxiety about our work and the business we’ve built , to concern and indeed guilt when i think of the many people facing lockdown in situations far worse than mine and alongside those immediate personal responses an intense collision of hope and fear for our collective future . this piece , really written with and by the whole team , is an initial attempt to draw on the thinking and work we at new citizenship project have done over the last five years to make sense , partly to ground our own work in this time , and partly with an ambition to offer something that can help the people we have worked with over the years to do the same . we would love to hear any thoughts , comments and ideas it provokes . the crucible the great paradox of this moment is that our society is moving slower , yet at the same time changing faster and more fundamentally , than it has for decades . all of us are adapting , and this is just the beginning . this is still the time , first and foremost , to keep our businesses afloat , our children educated , and our relatives looked after . but in an only slightly broader view , this is also a time of tremendous and urgent importance . this moment is a crucible from which our society , economy and politics — and more importantly all of the organisations , large and small , that make those up — will emerge as different beasts . at the new citizenship project , we have a particular way of seeing this challenge . since 2015 , we have been working from the understanding that in the broad historical moment of the early 21st century , we are entering the era of the citizen a time when people , dissatisfied with being mere consumers , increasingly yearn for agency and control over what matters to them , and where authentic participation based on agency and purpose holds the key to a brighter future . these are ideas that have earned a platform and stimulated change at organisations from the guardian to the co-op to the european central bank . now , with covid-19 , the historical moment has ceased to be broad , and become immediate . in this context , our purpose here is to offer our underlying framework , in the hope it might be helpful in three ways as a lens to help make sense of what is happening of what is happening as a way of framing the deep choice that we now face collectively and the deep choice that we now face collectively and as an invitation to step into the agency we all have — even now — to shape the future . the citizen shift five years ago , we published a report called this is the #citizenshift , laying out the core ideas that continue to underpin all our work . our argument was that there are broad historical moments when the dominant moral story of our society changes . at the start of the 20th century and for centuries before , we were subjects the right thing to do was to keep our heads down , do our duty and be content with our lot , while the god-given few led society forward . through two world wars , this story collapsed . in the decades that followed , we became consumers the right thing to do was to look out for ourselves , to choose the best deal from those that were offered , to produce whatever people would consume , because if we did the best society would result . our report argued that , in the 21st century , we are now living through another moment of collapse and rebirth a shift from consumer to citizen . now , the right thing for us to do is to get involved , to step into our own power to shape the world for the better , and to open up opportunities to do so for others . the flaws of the consumer story have been badly exposed by the financial crisis and the climate emergency , and the digital era has created new spaces for participation that we can use to replace it with the citizen story . subject consumer citizen quickfire concepts — from this is the #citizenshift the urgency of now this understanding frames our mission at the new citizenship project working with organisations of all shapes and sizes to help them build and inhabit the citizen story . we support and challenge the organisations we work with to name and recognise consumer logic in what they do , and to adopt new behaviours and structures which channel people’s ideas , energy and resources ( to use the language of our friends at lincolnshire coop ) , not just sell them stuff . as we have been doing this work , we have been thinking and learning about how the big societal change will happen how the citizen will move from an emergent possibility to become the new dominant story . with covid-19 , two things have changed in our view . first , this just got very real the historical moment is no longer broad , but immediate . second , it has become clear that the step forward into the citizen story cannot be taken for granted the dominant story will be contested , and there is no guarantee this story will win . this , then , is how we understand what is happening right now . we are living through a contest between these three deep stories . all three are present and alive in this moment . one will emerge as dominant , and which it is will dramatically shape our collective future . three possible futures the consumer story could be restored . this is what “back to normal” would mean . it would be a little like the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash . some part of all of us wants this very badly our commutes , our coffees , our crises put back where they were so we can “open back up” and pick up where we left off . and there will be powerful interests and an awful lot of money put into making this happen for us a recent piece by julio vincent gambuto brings this to life with a powerful prediction of the “ultimate gaslighting” , as billions of pounds are spent persuading us to pretend that nothing ever happened . the subject story is also making a very big comeback . we are already seeing not only the accentuation of already appalling levels of inequality , but also near-universal acceptance — even embrace — of radically reduced civil liberties . if there is a part of us that wants to go back to normal , there is another that is reassured by the idea that someone else is in charge . this is a story that has a clear path to develop , build and take over . there is significant potential for mass surveillance programmes to come into operation and be framed as essential to the lightening of lockdown , tracking people in order to track the virus . hungary and israel have already been described as the first “virus dictatorships” it is all too plausible that others could follow . the huge opportunity , though , is to make this the moment when we choose to step forward together into the citizen story . we are already seeing the myriad ways that people , communities and organisations are reclaiming agency and finding purpose within the present moment , despite the restriction of individual freedoms . mutual aid groups and hyperlocal self-organising units have sprung up everywhere . businesses and suppliers are coming together rather than simply competing . some central government departments and more local authorities ( though not all ) are making interventions that seek to sustain , channel and develop agency , not just treat people as self-interested individuals to be policed or “nudged” into compliance . there is a part of us that is deeper and more fundamental , and has been more starved , that is nourished by this , a part we feel when we look across the fence , clap the nhs , and act for someone we do not know . this too could grow . this does not just have to be a nice side effect it could be the beginning of the new story . these are the three ways forward from here . to be brutally frank , two will simply result in continual and cascading failure , for organisations of all types and for humanity as a whole . if we return to the consumer story , we will be back to square one on the challenges of climate and inequality ( and more ) that this story has arguably created , having eaten time we do not have . in short order , we will be back in crisis . the subject story is even worse , restoring the standing challenges but with the addition of the kind of cover-ups and conspiracies that will hamper progress and slow change even more . in short order , we will be back in crisis . both scenarios are seductive , because they’re familiar , but they won’t work . the citizen story is the only one that actually works . but it is the most difficult , because it is unfamiliar we are still early on in the imagining and shaping of a citizen society . the institutions and processes are not “off the peg” . we have work to do . all of us . the agency we all have there is of course much in this moment that sits in the hands of national governments , more than has been the case for decades . but to leave that statement to stand bare and unexamined is to walk the path to the subject story , or at best the consumer . the citizen story by contrast adds two important qualifications first , that government in a democracy is , in principle , government by citizens — i . e . all of us are involved — not government of citizens and second , that the space for government is defined by wider society — the communities we live in , and the organisations we work for . with this understanding , we restore our agency , our power to shape the future , both individually and collectively . in this view , indeed , the bigger truth is that no government can make the citizen story happen for us . it will require communities across the country and the world , and organisations from across sectors to lead into new ways of thinking and operating — and it will require this to be driven by individuals who have the courage to think and act differently , learning more from their peers and fellow citizens in other sectors than from the previously established norms of their own worlds . this has to some extent always been the case , but it is so much more true in times of flux and uncertainty . careers , reputations , and legacies will be made in the coming months , many of them apparently from nowhere . organisations of all sectors will reorient dramatically . that is what it means for society to reshape . this is a huge moment of opportunity for us all , individually and collectively . there are no answers yet as to exactly how to do this . as a starting point , then , here are three levels of questions we offer you to ask yourself , and that we are asking ourselves . as an individual citizen… how can you find and build agency in your own life in this moment , even through small actions ? how can you recognise in yourself when you are being treated as a subject or a consumer ? how can you call this out when it happens ? how can you recognise when you yourself act towards others as citizens , creating opportunities for them to express their agency ? as a citizen of a local community… how can you find a level of connection to the place where you are that works for you ? how can you make a contribution that you can sustain and that is right for you ? how can you develop your understanding of where power lies locally — what councils and authorities are there ? how are they operating and treating people locally ? how can you help or perhaps challenge them to do it better ? as a citizen of your organisation\/employer… how do you understand the purpose of your organisation ? what is it really there in the world to do , and what could it be ? how could your organisation operate differently in order to create more space for people to find their agency , and share in its purpose , not just transact ? how could your organisation involve people more directly and actively ? how could you start or build something in this moment , even something small , that could grow ? ultimately , all these questions stem from one that is deeper and more fundamental what would you do in this time if you truly believed in yourself and in those around you ? this is happening we want to close for now by saying that we see the people we have worked with over the years leaning into this already , and indeed we have got this far with our understanding by watching you . we’re already inspired by kirklees council with their approach to partnering with and supporting community organisations rather than attempting to either replace or manage them ( see community response kirklees ) the guardian working with readers and communities through initiatives like anywhere but westminster to understand the true impact of the virus the co-op seeking to put its member participation platform in service of community support and perhaps most of all by the university of bath students’ union ( the su bath ) for the energy , commitment and all-round citizenship -small and big ‘c’ - of their officers , staff and members ( not least in their work with bath and north east somerset third sector group , another organisation we hugely admire ) . over the last five years , we’ve built a business out of both celebrating and supporting organisations of all sectors to build the citizen story . in the coming weeks , we’re going to be looking for more examples like this to celebrate , organisations reframing and reinventing their relationships with people to build and distribute agency , and talking to the people who are doing it and if we can help you be part of it , we’re here . this is a crucial time , a difficult time , and a dangerous time . but it is a time when the citizen shift is very much on the cards .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In light of the current global situation, many of us are experiencing a range of emotions, such as fear, anxiety, and concern. We at New Citizenship Project have been reflecting on our work over the past five years and how it can be applied in this challenging time. We believe that now, more than ever, it is crucial to understand and embrace the concept of being a citizen rather than just a consumer.\n\nIn the early 21st century, we started to witness a shift from being mere consumers to empowered citizens. Dissatisfaction with the consumer mindset has led people to yearn for agency and control over what matters to them. This shift towards authentic participation and purpose holds the key to a brighter future. Our work has gained traction and influenced organizations such as The Guardian, the Co-op, and the European Central Bank.\n\nHowever, with the outbreak of COVID-19, we now find ourselves in a moment that requires immediate action. It is a contest between three deep stories: the consumer story, the subject story, and the citizen story. While the first two may seem familiar and comfortable, they ultimately lead to continued failure and crises. Only the citizen story can provide a sustainable path forward. Despite its unfamiliarity, this story offers the most promise for positive change.\n\nAs individuals, it is vital to find and build agency in our lives, no matter how small the actions may seem. It is essential to recognize when we are being treated as subjects or consumers and to call it out when it happens. Furthermore, we must create opportunities for others to express their agency and act as citizens.\n\nAt the community level, we should strive to establish connection and make contributions that are sustainable and appropriate. Developing an understanding of local power structures and holding authorities accountable are also crucial steps to fostering change.\n\nWithin our organizations, it is necessary to examine their purpose and identify ways to create more space for individuals to find agency and share in the organization's mission. Actively involving people and initiating small projects that can grow over time are also valuable endeavors.\n\nUltimately, all these actions stem from embracing a fundamental belief in ourselves and those around us. If we truly believe in our capabilities and recognize the potential within our communities and organizations, we can create a better future for all.\n\nWe have witnessed inspiring examples of organizations already embracing the citizen story, such as Kirklees Council partnering with community organizations, The Guardian engaging with readers and communities, and the Co-op using member participation to support their communities. We commend these efforts and will continue to explore and celebrate more organizations that are redefining their relationships with people to foster agency.\n\nIn these testing times, the citizen shift is not only possible but necessary. We understand the difficulties and dangers that lie ahead, but we firmly believe in the power of the citizen story. Let's seize this opportunity to shape a future where everyone can make a meaningful contribution. We are here to support and celebrate your efforts, so please reach out if we can be of assistance.

It is often observed that even when a great speech is delivered, and everyone in the audience agrees with its message, very few actually take action. This can be attributed to the fact that context plays a crucial role in the comprehension and subsequent impact of any information. In order for it to truly resonate and create a lasting effect, one's context needs to be aligned accordingly.\n\nUnderstanding one's ability to grasp and process information is vital. Just as we wouldn't expect a five-year-old to comprehend concepts of quantum mechanics due to their limited cognitive capacities, we shouldn't assume that everyone will immediately grasp and apply a given truth. People may not be at the right stage of mental development to fully understand and utilize certain insights. This is why often, life advice from parents may go over a child's head, as their mentality is still evolving.\n\nFurthermore, timing is a crucial factor. How we react to information is contingent upon what is currently going on in our lives. A recent college graduate, for example, is more likely to absorb career advice as it is directly applicable to their current circumstances. The same advice may not have the same impact on someone still in high school. Consequently, we may hear the same wisdom repeatedly over the course of years without truly internalizing it, simply because the timing was not aligned with our personal journey.\n\nIn addition to timing, the way information is presented also influences our reactions. Different individuals respond differently to various forms of communication. While some individuals prefer reading and absorbing written content, others may thrive through listening and auditory stimulation. Moreover, some may respond better to a gentle and nurturing approach, whereas others may require a more direct and motivational push. The manner in which information is delivered, along with the genuine care, humility, and interest demonstrated by the communicator, significantly impacts our receptivity to their message.\n\nBoth our context and personal growth affect the way we receive and interpret information. As individuals, we evolve over time, shaped by the challenges, victories, and experiences we encounter. Our perspectives change as we progress through life, and every interaction with knowledge should be viewed through fresh eyes. It is not uncommon to find new insights and make connections upon revisiting familiar books, talks, articles, or movies. The beauty of timeless wisdom lies in its ability to deepen our comprehension each time we encounter it. Just as we may discover the hidden adult jokes in cartoons that once flew over our heads as children, revisiting our favorite sources of knowledge can bring added insight and appreciation, highlighting our personal growth in the process.\n\nUltimately, understanding the importance of context, timing, and delivery ensures that we not only comprehend information, but also internalize it, leading to meaningful and transformative action.

Its powerful impact has made it a constant presence on my playlists, reaffirming my love for music. \"Nearer My God\" possesses a hauntingly beautiful quality that I will do my best to describe in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe lyrics of this song serve as a self-reflection on the band's existence and their journeys within their careers. The track opens with Murphy's impassioned outcry of \"I want it all,\" followed by the poignant admission of willingness to sell his soul to become \"America's pool boy,\" the crown centerfold. These lines, set against a gripping musical backdrop, convey Murphy's desperation and anxiety with a palpable intensity. One can only imagine the anguish that arises from dedicating one's life to a craft, such as music, only to question those decisions a few years down the line. The weight of this uncertainty is undoubtedly crippling.\n\nAfter listening to this song multiple times, I have come to appreciate the honesty and vulnerability that led to its creation. Aside from the lyrical brilliance, the synchronicity between the music's climactic moments and the lyrics is the final piece that elevates this song. When Murphy repetitively asks, \"Do you want me at all?\" the background music swells into a piercing crescendo, effectively dividing the song into its two halves. This moment serves as one of the most impressive musical moments I have ever experienced.\n\nAs Murphy's voice reenters the track a few measures later, the lyrics undergo a significant shift from a longing for musical fame to a contemplation of its inherent flaws. Singing, \"I've got it all,\" Murphy's tone conveys no greater contentment than before. Despite its brevity, this song leaves one emotionally drained. It is clear that the creation of this piece required immense courage and labor, which is reflected in its dissection of complex themes. The attentive listener will appreciate the meticulous combination of lyrics and music that effectively conveys these elements.\n\nWhile not the most accessible or easy to listen to, the value and beauty of this song simply cannot be overlooked. It stands as a testament to the dedication and creativity of its creators, leaving an indelible mark on anyone who takes the time to truly engage with it. END"}

As Max's nervous system, I find it imperative to express the challenges I face when Max lacks sufficient human interaction. This incident demonstrates how his communication style can sometimes result in embarrassing and frustrating experiences.\n\nThe Encounter:\nYesterday, while accompanying Max to the mailbox, we unexpectedly encountered a neighbor. It could have been a brief and pleasant exchange, but Max couldn't resist delving into his personal feelings, mentioning his recent break from his workout routine and subsequent back discomfort. Unfortunately, this neighbor seemed unaware of Max's tendency to answer questions in great detail, leading to a prolonged and detailed response.\n\nMy Reaction:\nAs his nervous system, my primary concern is to maintain Max's well-being. Observing his extended conversation, I realized I had to intervene. In a desperate attempt to halt the conversation, I alerted his brain, metaphorically requesting assistance through a 911 call. However, Max's stream of words continued with an unrivaled flow and intensity.\n\nA Spiritual Appeal:\nRecognizing the urgency to bring an end to this unintended monologue, I attempted to appeal to Max's empathy by connecting with his soul. Alas, the soul had already detached itself from the situation, taking refuge elsewhere. Exasperated, I understood the soul's distress, as it silently pleaded for Max to cease his incessant talking.\n\nResolution:\nFinding no success with my previous methods, I resorted to utilizing my control over Max's physical actions. Focused on relieving the situation, I swiftly initiated a small movement within his back, causing Max to flinch. This physical response diverted his attention and allowed the listener to break free from the entangling conversation.\n\nThe Aftermath:\nWith the listener finally released, Max's spirit returned to its rightful place, while I remained on hold with his brain. It is noteworthy that throughout this incident, the background music inadvertently playing only added to the growing tension. However, once the hold was lifted, a customer service neuron from the brain inquired about the emergency, to which I clarified that no emergency existed, requesting soothing music like Debussy for Max's well-being.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, this incident highlights the importance of effective social interaction for Max's well-being. As Max's nervous system, it is my duty to communicate the challenges faced when prolonged isolation leads to situations that can be both embarrassing and frustrating. By recognizing the significance of human connection, we can assist Max in achieving a more balanced and fulfilling life, decreasing the likelihood of similar encounters in the future. END"}
{"prompt":"the mosquito a human history of our deadliest predator — timothy winegard a terrific subject and stirring information are tethered to a book that unfortunately loses credibility as you dig deeper microhistory is taking over the nonfiction market , and the newest addition , timothy winegard’s the mosquito a human history of our deadliest predator is a perfect example of the intriguing subgenre . if you’re not familiar with “microhistory” , it is a relatively new trend that takes a specific subject and tracks it throughout ( usually ) the history of the world . examples are mark kurlansky’s books cod a biography of the fish that changed the world , salt a world history , and milk ! a 10 , 000-year food fracas . ( if this subgenre interests you or you now realize , like me , that you love these kinds of books , take a look through book riot’s terrific list of 50 must-read microhistories . ) timothy winegard’s brand new the mosquito is a great addition to the realm of microhistory in a couple of different ways . first , it’s surprising that this book has not already been written , considering the popularity of microhistory and the importance of mosquitoes in world history , as winegard deftly explains in the book . also , there is simply a great wealth of historical information in this book , all told through the lens of the mosquito but branching out in many surprising directions . i have not thought about mosquitoes the same way since reading this book , and that is part of the point . i don’t even remember kurlansky’s milk ! affecting me in quite the same way . however ( and this is a big “however” that i will deal with in detail below ) , i found several historical assertions or bits of information in the mosquito that were either overstated or flat incorrect . this has really colored my perception of the book , and it has something i have been sifting through mentally for weeks now . but first , the good . winegard is a skilled writer that knows how to weave a good historical narrative . he also makes a great case for his main thesis , which is essentially that the mosquito , a tiny insect that can be swatted in an instant , might have had the greatest influence on world history of any non-human entity . winegard states that some researchers have estimated mosquitoes are responsible for the death of almost half the humans that have ever lived . even as diseases like malaria and yellow fever have either disappeared or been isolated to certain world regions , mosquitoes kill more humans per year than any other being , including other humans ( if you , like winegard , don’t count abortions , but i digress ) . winegard weaves the story of the mosquito through all* of world history , from speculation about whether mosquitos were responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs to modern attempts to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases . the breadth of time covered is outstanding , considering the speculative nature of the subject as you go further back in history . winegard is not afraid to speculate and give an idea of where the scholarship is on a specific question , like what killed the dinosaurs or the positive effects of the marshes on ancient rome’s defensive capabilities . he even has a very interesting theory about how mosquitoes aided in the spread of christianity because the religion “preached care for the sick as a recognized christian duty . ” this analysis of the mosquito from every angle and its effect on several major movements and developments in world history makes the mosquito a very useful source for anyone interested in history . * ( “all” is more a reference to the time periods the book covers and not the regions of the world . the mosquito is very focused on western civilization to the detriment of almost any discussion of africa or asia . there is a 10-page chapter on the mongols , but that’s it . i got excited when one page had an illustration of japanese treatments for mosquito-borne diseases , but there was no mention of japan on that page or anywhere else in the book . however , i am willing to give winegard a slight pass on the eurocentric nature of the book because i’m sure it is more difficult to work with non-western sources of this nature and he is writing a mass-market history book , not an academic one . i would have just loved to see china , india , japan , or any african country get a little bit of love . ) one specific positive of winegard’s book is his writing style . he is able to tell stories well and injects humor often in order to make his points . one example sticks out to me , when writing about herodotus’ narrative of egyptian treatments for malaria ( herodotus ) also reveals that the prevailing egyptian practice for treating malarial fevers was to bathe in fresh human urine . having never contracted malaria , i can only assume that its symptoms are so unbearably severe that a pampering soak in sparkling , steaming urine issuing from your thoughtful and upstanding servants is worth a shot for some well-deserved relief . not only can that excerpt be laugh-out-loud funny depending on your style of humor , but the words he uses are evocative and almost disturbing , which is a good thing when you are describing the horrific things winegard relays in the mosquito . for all these reasons , i wanted to love the mosquito . and part of me did . but i had some serious problems with multiple portions of winegard’s historical examples and analyses . so here comes the negativity . i was rolling along very happily in the book until i reached the chapter on mosquitoes and the development of christianity . winegard makes several great points , including one about how constantine’s decree did not make christianity the official religion but instead simply proclaimed religious toleration for christianity . but then he makes statement that is simply and completely incorrect . he writes in 325 , constantine went one step further at the council of nicaea . to placate the adherents of the diverse and assorted polytheistic and christian factions , and end religious purges , he blended their beliefs into one faith . constantine ratified the nicene creed and the concept of the holy trinity , opening the doors for the compilation of the current bible and modern christian doctrine . ok . this lights a fire under me specifically , but let’s look at it factually . this connection between christianity and polytheistic factions in europe is pointed out often , and no doubt some syncretism occurred in areas large and small . christian practices incorporated polytheistic practices all over europe , the most obvious of which is seen in western christmas traditions , but syncretism between christianity and european polytheism did not ever reach the level of universal church doctrine . councils like nicaea were convened to ensure this . both points winegard makes here , about the biblical canon and the trinity , are listed under “misconceptions” in the council of nicaea article on wikipedia . ( yes , i know , wikipedia is not a great source for research , but major articles are reliable and it is a good jumping off point for research . if winegard had consulted wikipedia at all instead of whatever sources he is spuriously using here , he would have seen sources to rebut his narrative and would not have made this mistake . ) the biblical canon had , essentially but not officially , been formed far before the council of nicaea , and the source of the misconception that it was formed at nicaea is a pseudo-historical account by voltaire . and , although the doctrine of the trinity was formally put forward by christians at least as early as the second century , it was not officially decided upon in the catholic church until after nicaea and as far as we know the trinity was not discussed at nicaea . the focus instead was on the deity of christ . a mistake in one excerpt isn’t a huge deal . then , in the aforementioned chapter on the mongols , winegard mentions that they had begun to conquer large swaths of eastern europe and infers that mosquitoes were a major reason that the mongols failed to conquer western europe . he makes no allusion to the real reason they turned back ogedei khan died , and there was a struggle for power , so batu and his army abandoned the war in order to join the struggle to elect a successor back in the empire’s center . could mosquito-borne diseases be a reason that they never returned ? possibly . but the lack of detail hurts the credibility of winegard’s narrative . then i encountered a very problematic passage that made me rethink a lot of what winegard has to say . in the chapter on the american revolution , he makes this statement in december 1773 , shortly after the ratification of the tea act , a strategic yet spiteful band of the sons of liberty disguised only in blankets and lampblack ( not in the mythical mohawk indian regalia commonly portrayed ) heaved 342 chests containing 90 , 000 pounds of tea into boston harbor during their tea party . wait , the colonists weren’t dressed as mohawks like i’ve heard for my entire life ? this is big news , so i looked for a source . none in the notes in the back of the book . google is up next . can’t find anything . i can literally find no source to back up winegard’s american-history-altering statement . usually you can find a source on the internet that says anything , you just have to weigh competing sources to find the most likely answer . not in this case . it’s possible i can’t find whatever source he is referencing here , but everything i could find upholds the fact that some of the sons of liberty were wearing indian garb . not all of them , and not all in full native headdresses as commonly portrayed , but definitely in indian dress . ( hey look , i’m actually including a link to my source to back up what i’m saying , and the source includes quotes from actual eyewitnesses to the event . ) i welcome winegard’s rebuttal and would love to see his sourcing , but this really bothered me . after the boston tea party sourcing fiasco , i went back to a couple other things that stood out to me earlier in the book , specifically a story about alexander the great’s death . winegard explained the scholarship around alexander’s death as coming around to the fact that he died of malaria ( a mosquito-borne disease ) , but my little bit of research turned up that still no one is sure of the cause , and a new study suggests a completely new cause and a date of death six days later than previously thought . so this series of issues bothers me for two major reasons 1 ) winegard shows a tendency toward the earth-shattering cynical view that disregards what years of scholarship portray . while this is sometimes healthy and something i even tend toward at times , it becomes dangerous when the breadth of research doesn’t support and you don’t give any source for what you are saying . that means no one can check your facts and they just have to take your word for it . 2 ) these major factual errors mean it is difficult to believe anything surprising that is said in the 400+ pages of this book . you have to do the work to double-check , as i did many times but not all the time , in order to know if a statement is true or if it is poorly-sourced . i’ve been wrestling with what to do with the mosquito for weeks now . i really do think a lot of it is beneficial to an understanding of world history , as winegard makes very good arguments that the mosquito is much , much more important to an understanding of major conflicts and world historical developments than it is given credit for . however , i cannot overlook the factual errors and misrepresentations within the text . someone who knows world history better than me could probably find even more , and as a mass-market history book i don’t think most people would see the errors and question some of them . we will probably have people running around saying that the sons of liberty didn’t wear indian garb to the boston tea party , and that is just not true . but they’ll think it is because they read it in a history book from a major publisher . i hope someone else writes this book or there is a second edition after it is read and revised by several historians . but in its current form , i won’t recommend it to my students and i can’t recommend it to you , reader , unless you want to do the work of checking everything that doesn’t seem right . i’m always a take-the-meat-and-spit-out-the-bones person , but sometimes the danger of getting hurt by the bones of “alternative facts” outweighs the benefit of the meat . i received this book as an earc courtesy of penguin group dutton and netgalley , but obviously my opinions are my own .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" \"The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator\" by Timothy Vinegar explores the fascinating subgenre of microhistory, which tracks a specific subject throughout history. Vinegar skillfully weaves a narrative that highlights the importance of mosquitoes in shaping world history. The book covers a wide range of historical periods, from the speculation about the extinction of dinosaurs to modern efforts to eliminate mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nVinegar makes a compelling argument for the significant influence of mosquitoes on world history, with researchers estimating that they have been responsible for the deaths of almost half of all humans who have ever lived. Despite the disappearance or containment of diseases like malaria and yellow fever, mosquitoes continue to claim more lives than any other being.\n\nOne of the strengths of this book is Vinegar's ability to provide a comprehensive analysis of the mosquito's impact on major movements and developments in world history. From the role of mosquitoes in aiding the spread of Christianity through the emphasis on caring for the sick to their effect on ancient Rome's defensive capabilities, Vinegar offers a captivating exploration of this tiny insect's far-reaching consequences.\n\nHowever, it is important to address some concerns about the accuracy of the historical assertions and information in the book. While Vinegar's writing style and ability to engage readers are commendable, I have identified several instances where his historical examples and analyses are overstated or incorrect. For instance, his claim that Christianity was blended with various polytheistic beliefs at the Council of Nicaea is factually inaccurate. Additionally, Vinegar's statement regarding the attire of the Sons of Liberty during the Boston Tea Party is not supported by any verifiable source.\n\nThese inaccuracies raise questions about the credibility of the book and prompt the readers to verify the information independently. As a mass-market history book, it is crucial to ensure that the facts presented are reliable and thoroughly researched. While I acknowledge the book's potential value in understanding world history, I cannot overlook these factual errors and misrepresentations.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator\" offers thought-provoking insights into the significant role mosquitoes have played in shaping world history, the presence of multiple historical inaccuracies and misrepresentations detract from its overall credibility. Therefore, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this book unless one is willing to fact-check the information presented. END"}

Despite this heart-wrenching loss, he continued to prioritize the well-being of his family both in the United States and back in Bangladesh. He firmly believed in the transformative power of education, and this belief was instilled in his children. Malta, currently a sophomore studying history and economics at Harvard University, and his younger sister attending the Trinity School in New York City, are testament to Mohammed's strong belief in the pursuit of knowledge and personal growth.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit the region in early March, Mohammed took the necessary precautions such as wearing a mask while driving his cab. As the situation worsened, he decided to stop driving and isolate with his children. However, approximately a week later, he started experiencing mild symptoms of COVID-19, including fever and cough. These symptoms rapidly escalated, ultimately leading to severe shortness of breath.\n\nOn March 26th, his family made the difficult decision to call an ambulance. Mohammed was admitted to Montessori Medical Center where he was quickly placed on a ventilator. Unfortunately, the rapid progression of his condition prevented his loved ones from being able to communicate with him. Despite the doctors' exhaustive efforts, including the administration of hydroxychloroquine and other medications, none were able to save Mohammed's life. Tragically, he passed away on April 1st, at the age of 56.\n\nReflecting on this unexpected loss, Malta expressed the immense shock felt by his family. The suddenness and unpredictability of Mohammed's passing have created a profound sense of grief and uncertainty about the future. Malta also expressed deep sadness that his father will not be able to witness the fruits of his labor manifest in the achievements of his children.\n\nMohammed For was an exceptional individual who dedicated his life to his family and the betterment of others. His unwavering determination and sacrifice have left a lasting impact on those who knew him. His memory will continue to inspire his children as they navigate their paths and strive for success, fueled by the values he instilled in them. END"}

One crucial factor for fostering creativity is access to financial resources and a comfortable lifestyle. A person must have the time and means to allocate towards the pursuit of their ideas. However, it is worth noting that individuals from various parts of the world have managed to create exceptional works within limited opportunities. These creative endeavors can be anything from sculptures to car prototypes or books. Creativity, by its very nature, is about utilizing available resources to produce something that has never been created before. While some individuals may have more opportunities than others, this does not diminish the possibility of creating something unique.\n\nUnderstanding that each of us has a specific set of opportunities in our hands, let us explore the second essential aspect of the creative process: work. It goes without saying that the act of creation requires time, labor, and thought. Creative individuals undoubtedly devote a significant amount of time to their work. However, it is important to note that simply working hard and persistently pursuing one's goals is not enough. The key to enhancing creative ability lies in creating free time and engaging in other activities. Although this may initially seem contradictory, a closer examination of the act of \"creating\" will shed light on why this is the case.\n\nWhen we concentrate on a task, we immerse ourselves in it, continually seeking knowledge and delving into the details. This focus necessitates shutting ourselves off from external distractions. While important for concentration, an extended period of intense focus diminishes the inflow of new information into our minds. Being creative means being open to new experiences and ideas. The more diverse the range of information and data that enters our brains, the greater the potential for recognizing, processing, and producing something novel. In addition, our external experiences and encounters inform and enrich our internal narratives. The story from the outside world fuels our internal storytelling.\n\nFurthermore, our brains exert substantial effort when we engage in intensive work or learning. Like any muscle group, the brain requires periods of rest to replenish and improve itself. Just as one cannot spend hours at the gym every day without providing the necessary nutrition and supplements for the body, the brain needs free time to process and organize the information it receives effectively. It is important to strike a balance between intense mental activity and designated leisure time. Allowing the mind to process and evaluate new information offers fresh insights and experiences that contribute to the act of creation. We have all experienced those moments when creative thoughts emerge not during periods of intense thinking, but when we are at ease or not actively contemplating. During such moments, the brain efficiently processes data and information without external pressure.\n\nThus, maintaining a harmonious equilibrium between productive creation time and leisure time, even if the latter may seem unproductive, is crucial. Both elements play essential roles in the creative process. END"}

Choices like Kubernetes may not be straightforward. However, with the use of cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, you can scale your Python applications efficiently. In this article, we will explore how to use Ray, a powerful Python framework, to launch clusters and scale Python applications on any of these cloud providers with just a few commands.\n\nTo get started, there are three main steps:\n\nStep 1: Develop your Python application locally or in the cloud of your choice.\nStep 2: Launch a cluster on your preferred cloud provider.\nStep 3: Run your application on the cluster.\n\nTo begin, you will need to install some Python dependencies, namely Ray, Boto3, Azure CLI, Azure Core, and Google API Python client. Install these dependencies using pip with the following command:\n\npip install -u ray boto3 azure-cli azure-core google-api-python-client\n\nNext, you need to configure the credentials for your chosen cloud provider. If you already have command line access to your cloud provider, you can skip this step. Otherwise, follow the specific instructions for each provider:\n\n- For AWS, configure your credentials in the ~\/.AWS\/credentials file as described in the Both documentation.\n- For Azure, log in using \"AZ login,\" then configure your credentials with \"AZ account set -s <subscription_id>.\"\n- For GCP, set the \"google_application_credentials\" environment variable as described in the documentation.\n\nThe Ray cluster launcher uses a configuration file that allows you to specify various parameters such as setup commands, instance types, files to sync, autoscaling strategies, and more. Here is a minimal example of a cluster configuration file:\n\n[cluster_config]\n# Specify details of your cluster here\n\nFor a more complete example, please refer to the documentation and fetch the appropriate configuration file for your cloud provider.\n\nOnce you have the configuration file, make a few minor modifications, such as replacing the key files and setting the project ID for GCP.\n\nNow, let's walk through the three steps to scale your Python application:\n\nStep 1: Create a Python application\nDevelop a simple Python script that you want to scale up. This script can be run on your laptop or in the cloud and uses Ray for parallel computation. You can find an example script in the provided link. Run the script using the following command:\n\npython script.py\n\nStep 2: Start the cluster\nTo start the cluster, execute the following command:\n\n# For AWS\nray up -y aws-config.yaml\n\n# For Azure\nray up -y azure-config.yaml\n\n# For GCP\nray up -y gcp-config.yaml\n\nStep 3: Run the script on the cluster\nFinally, you can run the script on the cluster using the command:\n\n# For AWS\nray submit aws-config.yaml script.py\n\n# For Azure\nray submit azure-config.yaml script.py\n\n# For GCP\nray submit gcp-config.yaml script.py\n\nOnce run, you will see the output indicating the resources and tasks executed on the cluster. If there is a delay in the cluster startup, you may need to wait for all nodes to become active.\n\nTo connect to the cluster, use the following commands:\n\n# For AWS\nray attach aws-config.yaml\n\n# For Azure\nray attach azure-config.yaml\n\n# For GCP\nray attach gcp-config.yaml\n\nRemember to shut down the cluster when you're done:\n\n# For AWS\nray down -y aws-config.yaml\n\n# For Azure\nray down -y azure-config.yaml\n\n# For GCP\nray down -y gcp-config.yaml\n\nOne advantage of using Ray is its extensibility. If you want to add support for a new cloud provider, you can extend the NodeProvider class, which typically requires 200-300 lines of code. Take a look at the AWS implementation for reference.\n\nIn conclusion, scaling Python applications on major cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure can be simplified using Ray. By following the three steps outlined in this article, you can easily launch clusters and scale your Python applications to meet your needs. END"}

The story begins with a young girl named Clarissa, who was observed by Australian music psychologists Gary McPherson and James Renwick. They noted that when Clarissa focused and concentrated, she made significant progress in just six minutes, equivalent to a month's worth of practice. This observation highlighted the importance of deep practice, where individuals actively engage and challenge themselves to improve their skills.\n\nPart 1: Deep Practice\n\nChapter 1: Finding the Sweet Spot\n\nCoyle introduces the notion of talent hotbeds, places known for consistently producing top performers. He describes his experience in one such talent hotbed, where he witnessed both moments of rapid and fluent movement, as well as slow and struggle-filled attempts. Through these observations, it became clear that progress is often made through small failures and a diligent process of breaking down skills into smaller components. This active retrieval of information and deliberate effort to overcome difficulties allows individuals to become smarter and more proficient in their chosen fields.\n\nChapter 2: The Power of Deep Practice\n\nThe concept of myelin, referred to as the \"holy grail of acquiring skill,\" is introduced. Myelin is a substance that grows through practice and strengthens neural connections, leading to increased proficiency. Coyle emphasizes that deep practice is not about muscle memory, but rather about the development of neural circuits that control our thoughts and movements. The goal is to reach a state of automaticity, where skills become second nature and effortless.\n\nChapter 3: Examining Success Stories\n\nCoyle explores the stories of successful individuals, such as Brazilian soccer players and Edwin Link, the creator of the first pilot trainers. He highlights the importance of deliberate practice, which involves focused work on technique, seeking constant feedback, and addressing weaknesses. These stories demonstrate that achieving mastery requires extensive practice and determination.\n\nChapter 4: The Three Rules of Deep Practice\n\nCoyle outlines the three rules of deep practice. The first rule is to break down skills into smaller chunks and practice them slowly before gradually increasing speed. The second rule emphasizes the importance of immediate recognition and correction of mistakes to enhance learning. The third rule states that deep practice requires intense focus and engagement, devoid of distractions. Through careful repetition and deliberate practice, individuals can improve their skills and build myelin.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, deep practice is a crucial component in skill development.

The network requirements are specified in the service definition using the AWS ECS service resource.\n\nWithin the service definition, the network configuration is specified as follows:\n```\nnetwork_configuration {  subnets = var.ECS_service_subnets\n  security_groups = [AWS_security_group.ECS_security_groups[each.value[security_group_mapping]].id]}\n```\n\nIn this instance, the private subnets are inherited from a module that defines the VPC. When creating the dynamic cluster, we simply reference the list of subnets in the VPC module to build the services within the desired VPC.\n\nThe security groups, on the other hand, make use of the `for_each` function in Terraform. This function allows us to build multiple resources that share the same arguments. The `for_each` loop is defined within the resource, and a map variable is passed into the specified argument, as shown below:\n```\nfor_each = var.create_microservices == true ? Var.far gate_microservices : {}\n```\n\nTo create the services, we specify that `create_microservices` must be true, and then provide a map containing all the arguments required for each service.\n\nThe module also allows you to define an arbitrary number of security groups using the following resource block:\n```\nresource AWS_security_group ECS_security_groups {  VPC_id = var.VPC_id\n  for_each = var.security_groups\n  name = '${var.environment}-${each.value[ingress_port]}'\n  \n ingress {    from_port = each.

Tags}\n```\n\nThis resource block iterates over the `var.security_groups` object, which is defined outside the module. It picks up a variable for each value that is prefixed with `each.value`. This allows you to define multiple security groups outside the module and map them to the respective services using the `security_group_mapping` variable.\n\nBy appending additional map objects, you can easily add more security groups.\n\nOverall, the network configuration and security group mappings in an ECS cluster are implemented using dynamic variables and modules, providing flexibility and scalability to the networking requirements.

After four decades, we have finally arrived. In the movie \"Her,\" Theodore Tomboy, played by Joaquin Phoenix, navigates a world steeped in a romanticized hue. By day, he works for a company that composes letters for individuals who struggle to express their emotions, serving as an emotional surrogate. Theodore is romantically involved with Samantha, an intelligent operating system. While engrossed in deep conversations with Samantha, Theodore remains disconnected from the people around him. He is attuned to a voice that only he can hear, yet this same voice serves as a companion to numerous others simultaneously. Is he influenced by the peculiar virtuality of his love, or does he simply avoid the challenges of engaging with a real person? The world depicted in \"Her\" is bathed in colors reminiscent of gauzy Instagram photos capturing Coachella enthusiasts. It is an interface where everything is a manifestation of technology. How does one communicate that which they do not fully comprehend?\n\nThe difficulty in discussing artificial intelligence (AI) clearly lies partly in the fact that comprehending AI necessitates communicating about it. Most of us lack a clear understanding of what AI truly entails. The term \"artificial intelligence\" dates back to 1955 when AI pioneer John McCarthy defined it as \"making machines perform tasks that would require human intelligence.\" This concept remains largely unchanged today. Wikipedia contrasts artificial intelligence, or machine intelligence, with the natural intelligence exhibited by humans and animals. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as \"the capability of computers or other machines to exhibit or simulate intelligent behavior, typically associated with the study of this.\" But what does this mean to an average person? Does it refer to chatbots successfully passing the Turing test? Does it imply a future robot uprising? Or is it, quite simply, the seamless interactivity where processing occurs subtly behind the scenes? AI is, in essence, a black box—an intricate device whose internal workings are not readily inspected or understood. We comprehend its functionality solely based on its inputs and outputs. We lack visibility into its inner workings, and access to such information is purposefully restricted.\n\nToday, there are three primary reasons for the opacity of algorithms, as explained by Jenna Burrell. Firstly, there is a need to safeguard algorithms classified as state or corporate secrets. Secondly, AI-related coding remains the domain of specialists, limiting accessibility. Lastly, a \"mismatch\" exists between how algorithms mathematically process information and how humans think. Bridging this discrepancy poses the greatest challenge. The European Union now mandates that AI systems be explainable, granting individuals the \"right to explanation\" as part of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recently enacted. EU citizens are entitled to an explanation regarding algorithmic decision-making processes, and they have the right to request human intervention. This regulatory framework reiterates the notion that individuals deserve agency and comprehension when faced with decisions made by machines.\n\nAccording to Cliff Huang, the public should focus on making the trade-offs inherent in AI transparent through open debate in public policy, rather than solely demanding explanations from AI systems. David Weinberger argues that instead of prioritizing explanation, AI should emphasize optimization. The goal should be to make the trade-offs transparent to all, rather than potentially impeding the progress of AI. Meanwhile, the US government has never been renowned for its well-designed PowerPoint decks. However, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has taken a step towards making the models behind machine learning and AI more explainable through its Explainable Artificial Intelligence program. This initiative is crucial in unraveling the meaning behind our discussions on AI. Nevertheless, I question what practical impact it will have on everyday individuals. The DARPA webpage for the project presents an image depicting what a user might inquire about, but it fails to manifest any immediate influence on the world. Notably, DARPA resorts to the same clichés as the Google image searches mentioned previously—a revealing observation. END"}

This impressive growth demonstrates the transformative impact that Facebook, as a mobile advertising powerhouse, has had on the ad industry. At BBD, we have fully embraced this rise by initiating Project Thumb Breaker—a strategic endeavor that aims to position BBD as the most effective creator of Facebook ads worldwide.\n\nIt is, however, important to acknowledge that while Facebook has disrupted the ad industry, it has also given birth to a new breed of upstart brands that have challenged legacy brands. Casper, Harry's, and numerous others, through their direct-to-consumer model, exceptional customer service, and smart branding, have managed to generate billions of dollars in revenue within a few short years. Unilever's recent acquisition of Dollar Shave Club serves as a powerful example of the disruptive potential of this model, as it clearly aims to challenge P&G's dominant brand, Gillette.\n\nUndoubtedly, Facebook advertising is a formidable driver of brand growth. Nonetheless, it functions best when integrated within a broader ecosystem of marketing channels. Research consistently demonstrates that campaigns which leverage a range of channels achieve stronger business results. Casper and Harry's exemplify this strategy by embracing the value of integrated campaign development—they do not solely rely on Facebook, Google, or any other individual channel.\n\nAs a daily commuter on the New York subway, I have noticed a rising trend of out-of-home (OOH) ads from start-up brands such as Talk space, Casper, and Harry's. These ads have proven to be highly effective in capturing my attention and influencing my purchasing decisions. For instance, when feeling stressed after a challenging week, Talk space's ad promoting their app's ability to instantly connect me with a therapist for just $32 per week resonates with me. Similarly, when I'm tired or not in the mood to cook or go out, Seamless' ad compels me to order food. Casper's ad, on the other hand, nudges me to consider investing in a new mattress if I'm experiencing difficulties sleeping due to a recent move. And when I'm heading to work, already groomed and ready for the day, Harry's ad gives me the impression that their products' design and style will make my mornings a little smoother. Notably, Talk space's OOH ad strategy effectively utilizes social norming to create the perception that the app is popular and effective.\n\nTherefore, it is imperative to heed Time Warner's statement that 95% of video consumption still occurs on TV and that a Facebook video, on its own, would rank as the 158th most watched show. Additionally, when Facebook proudly declares 1.03 billion daily active mobile users, it emphasizes that no single media channel can serve as a cure-all for campaign success. Marketers aiming to create the most effective work must harness the power of communications planning to integrate their advertising efforts across all channels. By adopting a comprehensive approach, strong communications planning can generate a multiplier effect on the impact of advertising. Print, OOH, TV, and Facebook are all pillars of robust campaign ecosystems.\n\nIn conclusion, while Facebook's rise in mobile advertising has revolutionized the industry, it is crucial for marketers to recognize the value of an integrated approach to advertising. By leveraging multiple channels and employing strategic communications planning, brands can create impactful campaigns that truly resonate with consumers. END"}

It is a natural and unavoidable part of our journey, but how we choose to approach it can make all the difference. Rather than greeting each birthday with trepidation or fear, it is important to adopt a positive mindset and take proactive measures to ensure a healthy and fulfilling future. In this article, we will explore simple ways to maintain good health as we age and dispel any fears associated with growing older. Rest assured, the best is yet to come.\n\nOne of the easiest and most effective ways to promote overall well-being in old age is by smiling. A genuine smile has the power to light up a room, but its benefits go far beyond that. Research, as discussed by Alan Castle in his work \"Better with Age,\" reveals that individuals who consistently express genuine happiness and possess a positive attitude tend to live longer lives. While it may not directly cause a longer life, smiling and exuding happiness have been correlated with increased longevity.\n\nPhysical exercise is another crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy body and mind as we age. Engaging in regular physical activity helps prevent a wide range of diseases, enables us to maintain a healthy weight, and reduces stress. Research suggests that starting around 50 years old, a part of the brain called the hippocampus begins to shrink. This region plays a crucial role in memory formation, executive function, and emotional well-being. However, regular cardiovascular exercise, even as simple as taking three walks per day, has been shown to prevent mental decline and encourage hippocampal growth. Walking with a companion can add a social element to the activity, further enhancing its benefits. Whether it's a brisk walk in the park or a gentle stroll around the neighborhood, even small efforts can make a significant difference in maintaining mental sharpness.\n\nFurthermore, it is vital to never stop learning. As we age, we are constantly presented with new situations and challenges. While it may be tempting to coast through life once we have settled into familiar routines, this complacency is detrimental to our health. Learning new things stimulates the brain and promotes the development of new neural connections. This act of lifelong learning has been associated with lower rates of dementia. Engaging in activities such as reading about unfamiliar topics, learning to play an instrument, mastering a new language, or memorizing poetry can help keep our minds sharp and agile. Embracing a dance class not only offers an opportunity to learn but also adds exercise and social interaction, creating a trifecta of brain-boosting benefits. By continually stepping outside our comfort zones, we encourage increased neuroplasticity, which fuels our brain's adaptability.\n\nIn addition to physical and mental well-being, nurturing social relationships is also crucial for healthy aging. Engaging in regular communication with friends and family is not only enjoyable but also works wonders for our overall health. As Alan Castle explains in \"Better with Age,\" older adults who maintain an active social life tend to outlive those who are more socially isolated. Moreover, staying socially connected has been associated with lower rates of dementia and improved immune system function. However, it is important to note that face-to-face interactions yield the most significant benefits, while phone calls, texts, and emails have more modest effects or are ineffective altogether. Particularly after retirement, making a concerted effort to venture out into the world and engage in face-to-face interactions is vital. Human connection is the key to aging well.\n\nAmidst the concerns and challenges that may arise as we age, it is essential to remember the many benefits that come with growing older. Studies consistently demonstrate that elderly individuals tend to be happier than those in middle age. While younger adults often fixate on negative information and material goals, older adults prioritize positivity and social goals. With age, wisdom and emotional control tend to grow, as does the ability to learn from mistakes and avoid hasty conclusions. Worrying about the future does not improve it; instead, embracing acceptance of our circumstances becomes a reliable marker of life satisfaction as we age. Indeed, negativity towards aging has been linked to higher rates of dementia and cardiovascular disease. Maintaining a positive outlook and feeling younger than our years are associated with adopting healthier lifestyles as older adults. It is essential to take a deep breath, remain present at the moment, and be grateful for what we have.\n\nIn conclusion, the best course of action is to accept our circumstances while simultaneously preparing for the future. Engaging in regular physical exercise, continually learning, and nurturing our relationships are all crucial steps in this journey. Life is a beautiful and ongoing adventure, and there is still plenty of time ahead to make the most of it. Age gracefully, cultivate a positive mindset, and embrace the opportunities that each day brings. END"}

When entering a market with a product or service that fulfills a need, there is a higher likelihood of building a successful business. However, several challenges must be overcome in the process, such as creating awareness, capturing customers, and gaining their loyalty. Additionally, fending off competition becomes crucial as other firms recognize the market opportunity and vie to establish a sustained and viable business presence.\n\nWhile the fight to become the \"first mover champion\" is indeed daunting, it is essential to note that rarely do first movers achieve a monopoly. There will always be subsequent entrants who closely follow and try to emulate the success of the initial mover. These second movers profoundly impact the market landscape by gaining a major market share after the first mover has laid the foundation. Essentially, they aim to replicate the accomplishments of the first mover while incorporating their own strategies. By capitalizing on the disadvantages faced by the first mover, the second mover can effectively gain an advantage and significantly impact market dynamics.\n\nOne significant challenge faced by first movers is creating awareness among the target audience. This endeavor requires substantial effort and resources. First movers must strive to make the latent need for their product or service crystal clear to the market. By doing so, they can attract early adopters who will hopefully spread the word and generate further interest. Consequently, the onus falls on the first mover to inform the market about the existence of their offering and encourage people to start using it.\n\nThis awareness created by the first mover becomes a valuable asset for the second mover. They can leverage this foundation and inform the same user base about their presence in the market, positioning themselves as a viable alternative to the incumbent first mover. A classic example of this dynamic unfolded when IBM succeeded in introducing computers and educating industries about their potential. Apple, as the second mover, entered the market by directly targeting IBM through their iconic \"big brother\" ad campaign during the Super Bowl. This strategy allowed Apple to disrupt the personal computer market and surpass IBM's dominance.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of first mover advantage is a crucial consideration for start-up founders. While it offers potential benefits, it is important to understand that subsequent entrants, known as second movers, can also seize significant market share by capitalizing on the initial mover's disadvantages. By closely observing and learning from the mistakes of the first mover, second movers can replicate successful strategies and develop their own, ultimately disrupting the market and presenting themselves as formidable alternatives.

{"prompt":"streaming data from the universe with apache kafka how astronomers deploy real-time pipelines to distribute data from the millions of objects discovered each night by modern telescopes let’s build a news feed from the universe ! you might think that data collection in astronomy consists of a lone astronomer pointing a telescope at a single object in a static sky . while that may be true in some cases ( i collected the data for my ph . d . thesis this way ) , the field of astronomy is rapidly changing into a data-intensive science with real-time needs . each night , large-scale astronomical telescope surveys detect millions of changing objects in the sky and need to stream results to scientists for time-sensitive , complementary follow-up observations . this data pipeline is a great example of a use case for apache kafka ® . astronomy in real time observational astronomers study many different types of objects , from asteroids in our own solar system to galaxies that are billions of lightyears away . though the timescales on which single astronomical objects change are generally on the order of millions of years , a telescope can detect millions of objects that appear to be changing on a single night . these objects , commonly known as transients , encompass a number of different phenomena including variable stars , gamma-ray bursts , supernova , and moving objects in the solar system like asteroids . to detect and study these transient objects , many astronomers will collaborate on “sky survey” telescopes , which collect data by taking images as they sweep across the night sky instead of pointing at individual pre-selected targets . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is an early pioneer of the survey technique , collecting tens of tbs of image data from nearly 1 billion objects . by taking the latest survey images of a swath of the sky and subtracting a previous reference image taken at the same location , astronomers can detect objects that change in brightness or have changed in position . to fully characterize transient objects , astronomers need to gather data from other telescopes at different wavelengths at nearly the same time . some phenomena , like supernova “shock breakouts , ” may only last on the order of minutes . astronomers need to be able to collect , process , characterize , and distribute data on these objects in near real time , especially for time-sensitive events . recently , a new sky survey came online with the specific aim of quickly detecting transient objects . the zwicky transient facility ( ztf ) images the entire northern sky every three nights . using image differencing , ztf detects about 1 , 000 objects in each image taken every 45 seconds , amounting to roughly 1 million changing objects per night . the data processing pipeline characterizes these objects , deriving key parameters such as brightness , color , ellipticity , and coordinate location , and broadcasts this information in alert packets . the case for apache kafka until recently , the detection rate of transient objects was relatively low and put few requirements on the underlying technology of alert distribution mechanisms . for example , the astronomer’s telegrams ( atel ) , a web service allowing astronomers to manually post and broadcast alerts from transient object detections , has distributed on the order of tens of thousands of alerts since its inception in 1997 . in order to distribute the alert data from ztf’s roughly million of nightly detections , a fully automated and scalable streaming alert distribution is required . additionally , ztf is a precursor survey for an even more technically challenging , upcoming astronomy project called the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) . the lsst is expected to detect about 10 million transient objects each night , an order of magnitude more than ztf , with a nightly data stream size of 1–2 tb of messages . the technology underlying the ztf system should be a prototype that reliably scales to lsst needs . there were a number of factors we considered in designing an alert distribution for ztf . first , we needed a system that would reliably distribute each alert message and could allow downstream listeners of the alert stream to rewind or catch up in real time , without losing data in the case of a dropped connection or a slow consumer . the existing standard alert distribution system , called the virtual observatory event transport protocol , acts more as a broadcast system , transmitting alerts only if a user is connected . kafka’s consumer offset management and the ability for consumers to rewind to the beginning of a topic are big draws . because these alerts are scientific quality data , an alert serialization format that preserves the integrity of the data so that it can be correctly interpreted by an end user scientist is imperative . for example , correctly storing numerical data as a double versus a float is a requirement for scientific calculations . the predominant existing astronomical alert format uses the semi-structured format xml . for alert stream rates low enough such that scientists can visually inspect messages , this format can definitely be appropriate . for alert rates of millions per night , scientists need a more structured data format for automated analysis pipelines . after researching formats-and reading about confluent’s suggestion of using avro with kafka -we settled on using avro , an open source , json-based binary format , for serializing the data in the alert messages . avro has the benefits of being very compact ( as opposed to xml’s verbosity ) being easy to characterize with simple json schemas supporting some degree of schema evolution having a couple of python libraries for reading and writing data another requirement for the alert distribution system is ease of use for the end user . the end user in our case is most likely an astronomy researcher . much of the code used by modern astronomers is written in python , so the ztf alert distribution system endpoints need to at least support python . we built our alert distribution code in python , based around confluent’s python client for apache kafka . alert data pipeline and system design the ztf telescope sits at the palomar observatory in california and takes images of the sky as it sweeps across at a rate of about one image every 45 seconds . the data then go through processing at caltech’s infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) . the images are cleaned to remove instrumental and atmospheric effects , as well as differenced to produce transient candidates . the data from these detections are then serialized into avro binary format . the avro alert data schemas for ztf are defined in json documents and are published to github for scientists to use when deserializing data upon receipt . part of the alert data that we need to distribute is a small cutout image ( or “postage stamp” ) of the transient candidate . with avro , we can have data fields serialize as type bytes , which allows for the inclusion of binary format data , such as these image cutouts or generally any individual file image cutouts from simulated data of a supernova detection . left science image . center template sky image . right difference image constructed by

the ipac’s kafka broker is available to only two external consumer for security purposes-a downstream kafka system at the university of washington ( uw ) and another kafka system in a commercial cloud , both using mirrormaker to mirror available alert stream topics . the university of washington runs a cluster of three kafka brokers , each deployed in a separate docker container ( built on top of confluent’s docker hub images ) , that feeds a permanent data archive of avro files and allows connections from a number of external collaborations of scientists focused on different subfields of astronomy . topics are separated into 16 partitions so that consumers of the stream can parallelize readers into a group of up to 16 for faster reading and parallel downstream filtering and processing

Night by Modern Telescopes \n\nIn the field of astronomy, data collection has evolved from a solitary astronomer pointing a telescope at a single object in a static sky to a data-intensive science with real-time needs. Modern telescopes, through large-scale astronomical telescope surveys, detect millions of changing objects in the sky each night and require a seamless stream of data to scientists for time-sensitive follow-up observations. Apache Kafka presents an ideal solution for this data pipeline.\n\nObservational astronomers study various types of objects, ranging from asteroids in our own solar system to galaxies that are billions of light years away. While individual astronomical objects typically change over millions of years, a telescope can detect millions of objects that appear to be changing in a single night. These objects, known as transients, encompass phenomena such as variable stars, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and moving objects in the solar system like asteroids. To detect and study these transient objects, astronomers collaborate on \"sky survey\" telescopes that collect data by sweeping across the night sky instead of focusing on pre-selected targets. One early pioneer of this survey technique is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which has collected a massive amount of image data from nearly 1 billion objects. By comparing the latest survey images to previous reference images, astronomers can identify objects that have changed in brightness or position. To fully characterize transient objects, astronomers need to gather data from other telescopes at different wavelengths in near real time. This requirement is especially critical for time-sensitive events like supernova \"shock breakouts\" that last only minutes.\n\nRecently, the Ricky Transient Facility (ZTF) has come online with the aim of quickly detecting transient objects. ZTF images the entire northern sky every three nights and detects approximately 1,000 objects in each image taken every 45 seconds, resulting in approximately 1 million changing objects per night. The data processing pipeline characterizes these objects, extracting key parameters such as brightness, color, elasticity, and coordinate location, and broadcasts this information in alert packets. \n\nBefore transitioning to Apache Kafka, the detection rate of transient objects was relatively low, and existing alert distribution mechanisms sufficed. However, with ZTF's detection rate increasing significantly, a fully automated and scalable streaming alert distribution system became necessary. Furthermore, ZTF serves as a precursor survey for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which is expected to detect approximately 10 million transient objects each night, thereby generating a nightly data stream of 1-2 TB of messages. Thus, the underlying technology of the ZTF system should be a reliable prototype that can accommodate LSST's needs.\n\nSeveral factors were considered while designing the alert distribution system for ZTF. Firstly, the system needed to reliably distribute each alert message and allow downstream listeners to rewind or catch up in real time without losing data in the event of a dropped connection or slow consumer. The Virtual Observatory Event Transport Protocol, the existing standard alert distribution system, acts as a broadcast system that transmits alerts if a user is connected. Kafka's consumer offset management and the ability for consumers to rewind to the beginning of a topic became attractive features for ZTF. Since the alerts are scientific quality data, preserving the integrity of the data so that it can be correctly interpreted by end-user scientists is crucial. The predominant existing astronomical alert format, XML, falls short in cases where scientists need to analyze millions of alerts per night. Therefore, ZTF decided to leverage Afro, an open-source, JSON-based binary format, for serializing data in the alert messages. Afro provides compactness, simplicity, schema evolution, and Python libraries for data manipulation.\n\nUser-friendliness was another essential consideration for the end-user, primarily astronomers. To support their preferences, the ZTF alert distribution system was built in Python using Confluent's Python client for Apache Kafka. \n\nThe ZTF telescope, situated at the Palomar Observatory in California, captures images of the sky at a rate of approximately one image every 45 seconds. The data then undergoes processing at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPA). The images are cleaned to remove instrumental and atmospheric effects and differenced to identify transient candidates. The resulting detections are serialized into Afro binary format. The Afro alert data schemas for ZTF are defined in JSON documents and published to GitHub for deserializing data upon receipt. As part of the alert data distribution, a small cutout image or \"postage stamp\" of the transient candidate is included. With Afro, data fields can be serialized as type bytes, allowing for the inclusion of binary format data such as image cutouts.\n\nSerialized alerts are produced to a Kafka broker, with each night's data written to its own topic. Data older than two weeks is expired from the Kafka system. The IPA Kafka broker is accessible to two external consumers: a downstream Kafka system at the University of Washington (UW) and another Kafka system in a commercial cloud. Mirror maker is used to mirror available alert stream topics between these systems. The UW system runs a cluster of three Kafka brokers (deployed in separate Docker containers) that feed a permanent data archive of Afro files, accommodating connections from various external collaborations of scientists focused on different subfields of astronomy. The topics are partitioned into 16 partitions to enable parallel reading and downstream filtering and processing at a group level of up to 16.\n\nDownstream filtering algorithms classify and separate different types of objects. End-user scientists can subscribe to topics of interest, and collaborations of scientists, termed event brokers, can also subscribe and redistribute alerts enriched with additional external data. The cloud-based Kafka system is public-facing for other astronomy researchers. Scientists can write scientific filters to automatically apply algorithms for detecting and tagging different types of objects, such as supernovae, variable stars, or near-Earth objects. These filters can be written in Python and deployed separately in different Docker containers.\n\nThe ZTF pipeline generates between 600,000 and 1.2 million alerts per night, with stress tests showing potential for handling up to 2 million alerts without technical issues. Each alert packet is approximately 60 KB in size, primarily due to the inclusion of cutout images, resulting in a total volume of up to 70 GB of data processed nightly. Serialized alert data is made available to end users roughly 20 minutes after an image is taken, with the image differencing pipeline accounting for the majority of the processing time. The transfer time from the main Kafka distribution hub to external consumers is approximately four seconds.\n\nApache Kafka has proven to be an invaluable tool for addressing the challenges in the distribution and analysis of astronomical data in real time. Its ease of use and compatibility with existing scientific workflows have made it a favorite among astronomers. As we continue to explore the potential of Apache Kafka, we aim to facilitate real-time data science pipelines for future projects at High Alpha Studio.\n\nFor more information, you can download the Confluent Platform, the leading distribution of Apache Kafka. Maria Patterson, an expert in optimizing scientific data analysis pipelines with a Ph.D. in astronomy, has played an integral role in various astronomical projects, including cloud-based pipelines for satellite imagery processing and the development of a science \"data commons\" for NOAA's big data project. Maria's current focus is on enabling the distribution of real-time object detection alert streams from large-scale telescopes.

His journey serves as an inspiration for anyone looking to pursue their goals, embrace a passion for learning, and contribute to their community. You may have had the pleasure of meeting Pour at the Startup Debut or one of the School of Startups workshops.\n\nPour's adventures in the Finnish startup world have yielded positive results, and he graciously agreed to share his experiences with the Shortcut. It all began with a dream and a desire to learn more. Pour decided to move to Finland in 2009, despite having a successful career in Iran. He recognized that he needed a different environment to further his education and personal growth.\n\nIn Iran, Pour started as a designer in the advertising department, but his ambition led him to explore various areas such as PR, advertising, marketing, strategic planning, and management. While he didn't have ample time to study every aspect thoroughly, this journey taught him valuable lessons and emphasized the fact that the more you learn, the more questions you have.\n\nWith Finland in mind as a conducive environment for growth, Pour began his search for educational opportunities. He stumbled upon the International Design Business Management (IBM) program at Alto University, which integrated business, design, and technology. Pour was eager to seize this opportunity, and despite knowing little about Finland, he was convinced it was where he could flourish, learn, and develop.\n\nLeaving Iran for the first time presented several challenges, including military service, financial constraints, visa issues, and language exams. However, Pour meticulously planned his journey, setting goals and working towards them one step at a time. His dedication and perseverance paid off, allowing him to overcome these obstacles and embark on his studies in Finland. Pour now considers Finland his home, appreciating its environment and expressing his desire to stay.\n\nWhen Pour started Grid, he was already deeply entrenched in the startup world. His involvement with Startup Sauna, a garage startup incubator at Alto University, introduced him to a plethora of ideas and opportunities. While Grid was formally registered as a company in 2016, it had been a project since 2014, right after Pour's graduation. Currently, Grid is in the product development stage, constantly exploring opportunities, learning, and refining their approach. For Pour, a startup's product extends beyond just an app; it encompasses the entire business model, reinforcing the importance of market validation.\n\nPour acknowledges the support he has received from the Finnish startup scene and emphasizes the significance of giving back to the community. Although not all the advice he received was positive, Pour believes that listening to different opinions and having open discussions is essential for growth. He wishes for a system that encourages knowledge sharing and feedback, as it strengthens everyone involved.\n\nReflecting on his journey, Pour emphasizes the importance of seeing individuals as unique beings and understanding their motivations and aspirations. By taking the time to comprehend what drives someone, we can provide more effective assistance and support. Having had similar experiences recently, Pour is committed to supporting others who are earlier in their startup journey. He recognizes the value of mentors who have slightly more experience and can guide aspiring entrepreneurs through the process.

{"prompt":"it feels like you’ve been staring at the computer screen for hours as you struggle to rewrite several paragraphs . you’re trying to capture in words the images in your head , but the sentences on the page sound lifeless and dull . maybe you’re writing a blog post about a recent trip you took , and you want your readers to hear the cacophony of the city’s traffic and see the neon signs drenching the street with color . or maybe you’re writing a sales page , and you want your readers to be able to envision themselves using your product . you want them to feel as if they’re already holding the product in their hands and can see how it will make their lives so much easier . the ability to describe something vividly is an essential skill for every writer to master , no matter whether you’re a blogger , novelist , or copywriter . vivid descriptions transform your paragraphs from vague and boring to engrossing and memorable . of course , like any skill , it’s one that takes time and practice to master . but there are ways to speed up that process and instantly transform your writing . one of the best ways to do that is to study the descriptions of expert writers and steal their techniques . in today’s article , i’m going to do just that by diving into one of my favorite books the great gatsby by f . scott fitzgerald . fitzgerald’s writing has always enchanted me . whenever i need a bit of inspiration , i love to turn to a page at random and study how fitzgerald makes the new york of the 1920s come alive . when fitzgerald describes one of gatsby’s parties , you feel like you are weaving in and out of the crowds and can almost hear the jazz music spilling across the gardens . i’m sure fitzgerald never tried to tell a story to his friends , and then gave up with a shrug , saying , “i guess you had to be there . ” let’s look at three simple techniques fitzgerald uses to bring his writing to life and how we can use them in our writing too . and an important note ! before fitzgerald became a novelist , he worked as a copywriter , creating slogans for billboards and signs in streetcars . so don’t think that these techniques are only for fiction writers . any writer can use them . 1 . add layers to your descriptions with metaphors and similes metaphors and similes are the first tool in fitzgerald’s paintbox for splashing his descriptions with color . if you already use metaphors and similes in your writing , that’s fantastic . we’ll look at some creative ways to make similes and metaphors even more powerful in this section . if you don’t use metaphors and similes , here’s a quick explanation of what they are . a metaphor or simile helps you take your description to another level by comparing two unlike things to each other as if they were alike . the only difference between them is that similes use the words “like” or “as” ( the wind sounded like a moan ) and metaphors do not ( the wind moaned ) . okay , let’s look at how fitzgerald uses similes and metaphors to enhance the images in his writing . here’s one example the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon . they were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house . first , these similes help us better visualize the scene . here’s what it would sound like without them the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were seated . they were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering . a bit boring , right ? without the similes , there isn’t really anything to make that scene stand out . second , they help set a mood for the paragraph . while fitzgerald isn’t writing a fantasy novel , by using similes about balloons and flying women , he’s able to give this scene an otherworldly feel . in a way , they’re like mini-stories within a story . let’s look at the metaphor fitzgerald uses in the last line of the book to see how these mini-stories can add depth to our own writing so we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past . this is one of the most quoted lines from the great gatsby , and for good reason . instead of just writing something like , “we try to move forward , but keep returning to the past” , fitzgerald elevates this simple idea by using the imagery of boats . yes , the reader might say , that’s how i feel too . i’m trying to escape the past but feel like i’m rowing against the current . wrapped in a metaphor , the idea is no longer vague , but tangible . so how can we effectively use metaphors and similes in our own writing ? here are several tips first , you can use a simile to deepen your descriptions ( as fitzgerald does ) or to better explain a complex concept or idea . for example “in order to perform this exercise , lie on your stomach , place your hands on the floor under your shoulders , and lift your chest off the floor as if you were a cobra . ” ( read my article here for more tips on how to explain complex ideas with similes and stories . ) second , you can use similes and metaphors to weave your personality into your writing . for example , say you love to play the piano , and you’re writing an article about blogging . you might write something like , i love to play piano , and i soon realized that blogging and playing the piano are alike in a lot of ways . just like you need to practice the piano every day if you want to improve your skills , you need to write consistently on your blog in order become a better blogger . third , you can use a simile or metaphor to evoke a specific feeling in your readers . blue apron does that on their homepage by comparing their recipes to creating magic . this imagery makes us think that cooking blue apron’s recipes must be easy and the food will taste delicious create magic…following our step-by-step instructions you’ll experience the magic of cooking recipes that our chefs create with your family’s tastes in mind . citibike also uses a simple but clever metaphor on their website unlock a bike…unlock new york . it is important to think of metaphors and similes like salt and pepper , however . a little sprinkle , and they’ll season your writing . but too many and you’re writing will be way too salty or way too spicy . a simile or metaphor in every sentence or paragraph will slow down the writing and detract from the specialness of each one . ( did you notice the simile i used in this paragraph ? ) fitzgerald uses metaphors and similes sparingly throughout the book , but when he does use them , they make you sit up and take notice . 2 . make descriptions delight the five senses with sensory words sensory words are the next tool that fitzgerald employs to help readers become immersed in his story . sometimes sensory words sparkle , sometimes they clang , other times they’re bristly . sometimes they’re bitter , other times delicious . sometimes they have a fragrant aroma . in short , sensory words are the descriptive words that apply to the five senses words related to sight or appearance ( these can also include words related to motion ) — gleaming , tarnished , shadowy , sparkling , dancing ( these can also include words related to motion ) — gleaming , tarnished , shadowy , sparkling , dancing words related to touch — velvety , icy , sharp , blunt — velvety , icy , sharp , blunt words related to taste — bitter , zesty , refreshing — bitter , zesty , refreshing words related to scent — musty , fragrant , sweet — musty , fragrant , sweet words related to sound — roar , sizzle , murmur see a list of more sensory words here . sensory words help you engage your readers’ five senses . they make your readers touch , taste , smell , hear , and see your descriptions . here are two sentences from the great gatsby that are filled with sensory words the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktailmusic and the opera of voices pitches a key higher…the groups change more swiftly , swell with new arrivals , dissolve and form in the same breath–already there are wanderers , confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable , become for a sharp , joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light . of course , in a work of fiction that type of description is captivating . but in a blog post or on another page of your website , you would probably want to be a little less poetic . and , yet , you can still use sensory words effectively . look at how bose uses sensory words in a product description for their headphones tiny earbuds for better sleep . noise-masking sleep buds . unwanted noise keeping you awake at night ? you’re not alone . that’s why we created a new solution . these tiny , comfortable and truly wireless earbuds are uniquely engineered to deliver soothing sounds that mask annoying noise — like snoring , pets , and loud neighbors — and help you fall asleep and stay asleep . so you can look forward to bedtime and be ready to take on tomorrow . how many did you spot ? sound noise-masking , soothing , snoring , loud . touch comfortable . sight & appearance tiny , wireless . 3 . zoom-in on your descriptions with a list of details fitzgerald’s third technique is quite simple . i call it “the detailed list” . take this paragraph as an example he took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them , one by one before us , shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray . while we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher–shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue . fitzgerald could have ended the sentence at “he took a pile of shirts and began throwing them , ” but he wanted us to be able to visualize the scene , to see the types of shirts that gatsby wore . so he zooms-in on them . he lists all of the different types of shirts . here’s another sentence that burst with a detailed list by seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived–no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums . again , fitzgerald uses the detailed list in order to create a specific image in our head . this wasn’t just any orchestra — it was lavish . detailed lists can be used in any kind of writing . on sales pages , they’re often used to emphasize a product’s many features . here’s an example from the sales page for the kindle paperwhite won’t tire your eyes in the dark ( unlike back-lit tablets that shine in your eyes , kindle guides light toward the surface of the display with its built-in front light so you can read comfortably for hours without eyestrain . ) learn more about a book before you start reading ( with about this book , see background information about the author , other books in the series , and more ) adjust your text size ( choose from eight text sizes to prevent tired eyes and keep you reading longer ) of course , if you crammed every one of your sentences with a list of details , your reader would become exhausted . but just as you can sprinkle metaphors and similes like salt and pepper , you can use detailed lists when you’re struggling to make a description more vibrant or when you want to make sure that your readers are picturing the correct image in their heads . the takeaway while fitzgerald was a masterful writer , these three techniques are simple and straightforward . you can start using them right away to add zest to your descriptions . when you transform bland paragraphs , you’re better able to hold the attention of your readers . and thus you’re more effective at sharing your message with the world .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It appears as though you have been diligently working on rewriting several paragraphs, striving to convey the vivid images in your mind. However, the sentences on the page lack life and excitement. Whether you are writing a blog post about a recent trip or a sales page to captivate potential customers, the ability to describe something vividly is a crucial skill for all writers to master, regardless of their genre. Vivid descriptions have the power to transform vague and dull paragraphs into captivating and memorable ones. While it may take time and practice to acquire this skill, there are ways to expedite the process and instantly enhance your writing. One effective method is to study and incorporate the techniques employed by expert writers.\n\nToday, I will be diving into one of my favorite books, \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, to analyze and illustrate three simple techniques he uses to bring his writing to life. Fitzgerald's writing has always enchanted me, and in moments when I seek inspiration, I often turn to a random page to study how he brings 1920s New York to life. When Fitzgerald describes one of Gatsby's elaborate parties, you feel as though you are part of the lively crowd, immersed in the sounds of jazz music echoing through the gardens. Fitzgerald clearly never settled for a lackluster storytelling experience, dismissing it with a shrug and the remark, \"I guess you had to be there.\" Let's examine these techniques and learn how to employ them effectively in our own writing.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that before Fitzgerald became a renowned novelist, he worked as a copywriter, crafting slogans for billboards and signs in streetcars. This serves as a reminder that these techniques are not exclusively for fiction writers, but can be employed by any writer.\n\n1. Add layers to your descriptions with metaphors and similes:\n\nMetaphors and similes are the initial tools in Fitzgerald's paintbox for infusing his descriptions with vibrant colors. If you already incorporate metaphors and similes into your writing, that is splendid. In this section, we will explore creative ways to make these literary devices even more powerful. In case you are unfamiliar with these terms, let me provide a brief explanation. Metaphors and similes allow you to elevate your descriptions by comparing two dissimilar things as if they were alike. The difference between them lies in the usage of words \"like\" or \"as\" in similes (e.g., \"The wind sounded like a moan\") and the absence of such words in metaphors (e.g., \"The wind moaned\"). Now, let's examine how Fitzgerald uses similes and metaphors to enhance the imagery in his writing.\n\nFor instance, in \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald writes: \"The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.\" These similes contribute to a better visualization of the scene. Without them, the passage would read: \"The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were seated. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering.\" Clear, but unremarkable. By utilizing similes, Fitzgerald imbues the scene with depth and sets a mood, giving it an otherworldly aura. In many ways, these similes function as mini-stories within the bigger narrative.\n\nLet's examine the metaphor Fitzgerald employs in the book's closing line: \"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\" This line is one of the most frequently quoted passages in \"The Great Gatsby,\" and rightfully so. Instead of simply stating, \"We try to move forward but keep returning to the past,\" Fitzgerald elevates this concept by using the imagery of boats. As readers, we can resonate with this metaphor and say, \"Yes, that's precisely how I feel. I'm trying to escape the past, but it feels like rowing against the current.\" Through this metaphor, a once vague idea becomes tangible and relatable.\n\nHow can we effectively incorporate metaphors and similes into our own writing? Here are a few tips:\n\n- Use similes to deepen your descriptions, as Fitzgerald does. They can also serve as explanatory tools to clarify complex concepts or ideas. For example, \"To perform this exercise, lie on your stomach, place your hands on the floor under your shoulders, and lift your chest off the floor as if you were a cobra.\" (For more tips on explaining complex ideas with similes and stories, read my article here.)\n- Employ similes and metaphors to infuse your writing with personality. Let's say you love playing the piano and are writing an article about blogging. You could write, \"I love playing the piano, and I soon realized that blogging and playing the piano share many similarities. Just as consistent practice is essential for improving piano skills, regular writing on your blog is crucial for becoming a better blogger.\"\n- Use a simile or metaphor to evoke specific feelings in your readers. Blue Apron accomplishes this on their homepage by comparing their recipes to the act of creating magic. The imagery they employ conjures up the idea that cooking their recipes will be easy, resulting in delicious food: \"Create magic...following our step-by-step instructions, you'll experience the magic of cooking recipes that our chefs create with your family's tastes in mind.\" Minibike also employs a simple, clever metaphor on their website: \"Unlock a bike...unlock New York.\"\n\nNonetheless, it is crucial to handle metaphors and similes like salt and pepper - sprinkle them sparingly; otherwise, your writing may become overwhelmingly spicy or salty. Overusing these devices in every sentence or paragraph can hinder the flow of your writing and diminish the impact of each one. (Did you notice the simile I used in this paragraph?) Fitzgerald himself uses metaphors and similes sparingly throughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" but when he does employ them, they demand attention and leave a lasting impression.\n\n2. Make descriptions engage the five senses with sensory words:\n\nSensory words are the next tool in Fitzgerald's arsenal, allowing readers to become fully immersed in his story. Sensory words have the ability to sparkle, clang, be bristly, bitter, delicious, or have a fragrant aroma. In essence, they appeal to the reader's five senses - touch, taste, smell, hear, and sight. Here are some categories of sensory words:\n\n- Sight or appearance (can also include words related to motion): gleaming, tarnished, shadowy, sparkling, dancing.\n- Touch: velvety, icy, sharp, blunt.\n- Taste: bitter, zesty, refreshing.\n- Scent: musty, fragrant, sweet.\n- Sound: roar, sizzle, murmur.\n\nSensory words help readers engage with and experience your descriptions. Let's explore a couple of sentences from \"The Great Gatsby\" that exemplify the use of sensory words:\n\n\"The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher...the groups change more swiftly, swell with END"}

In this article, we will delve into how artificial intelligence can enhance the value of your business. Before we proceed, it is important to understand what artificial intelligence truly entails.\n\nArtificial intelligence, often referred to as AI, refers to the capacity of systems to respond to received inputs without explicit training. This is made possible through the utilization of algorithms, data analysis, datasets, and other cognitive observations. While there is speculation that AI will eventually replace human labor, it has primarily proven to be beneficial in streamlining day-to-day tasks and enabling individuals to focus on more complex responsibilities that genuinely require their attention.\n\nLet's explore how AI can contribute value to your business. Firstly, improved customer relations stand out as a prominent benefit. It is widely acknowledged that customer service and support roles often involve repetitive tasks, leading to a decline in the quality of service provided. Deploying AI in this realm has proven to be highly effective. Virtual customer assistants (TCAS) have gained popularity, with many businesses utilizing chatbots and similar technologies that leverage predictive analysis, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and other AI derivatives to enhance customer interactions.\n\nAre you involved in the marketing business? If so, embracing artificial intelligence should be a priority for you. Machine learning, also known as cognitive learning, enables systems to learn from past inputs and make informed decisions. This technology can be employed in marketing to employ various algorithms and better understand customer preferences when they visit a website or application. It also facilitates analyzing user behavior and enabling smoother navigation.\n\nFurthermore, data-to-text conversion plays a crucial role in ensuring an app's success. Many applications rely on complex databases and datasets, which can complicate the user experience. To overcome this, employing technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) can simplify data at the backend and present it in a user-friendly format.\n\nMoreover, audio-to-text conversion has revolutionized data input methods. Traditional typing has been supplanted by voice commands, thanks to the advent of speech recognition technology. Prominent examples of this technology include Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google Assistant. By utilizing speech recognition, users can interact with websites and applications simply by speaking.\n\nBy now, you should have a clear understanding of the potential of artificial intelligence in augmenting your business's value. Should you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team of experts. We are eager to help you integrate AI into your business and propel it to unprecedented heights.\n\nOriginally published on October 29, 2018, at yugasa.com. END"}
